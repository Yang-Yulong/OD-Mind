# Abstract  

The opening of the North Atlantic about 56 My ago was associated with the emplacement of th e North Atlantic Igneous Province, including the deposition of voluminous extrusive basaltic successions and intrusion of magma into the surrounding sedimentary basins. The mid-Norwegia n Margin is a global type example of such volcanic rifted margins and is well suited for scientifi c drilling with its thin sediment cover and good data coverage. During International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 396, 21 boreholes were drilled at 10 sites in five different geological settings on this volcanic margin. The boreholes sampled a multitude of igneous and sedimentar y settings ranging from lava flow fields to hydrothermal vent complexes, along with thick successions of upper Paleocene and lower Eocene strata. A comprehensive suite of wireline logs was collected in eight boreholes. The main goals of the expedition were to provide constraints fo r geodynamic models to test different hypotheses that can explain the rapid emplacement of larg e igneous provinces and the hypothesis that the associated Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximu m was caused by hydrothermal release of carbon in response to magmatic intrusions. Successfu l drilling, combined with high core recovery of target intervals of all nine primary sites and on e additional alternate site, should allow us to achieve these goals during postcruise work.  

# 1. Introduction  

Continental extension, breakup, and the formation of new mid-oceanic spreading centers are fundamental parts of the plate tectonic cycle and have wide implications for the global environmen t (Berndt et al., 2019). Passive rifted margin studies have been at the core of the International Ocea n Discovery Program (IODP) and its predecessors since the 1960s. Deep Sea Drilling Projec t (DSDP) and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) drilling, along with extensive seismic surveying of th e northeast Atlantic conjugate margins, demonstrated anomalously high volcanic activity durin g continental breakup. This led to the classification of these margins as “volcanic rifted margins ” (Talwani and Eldholm, 1977; Eldholm et al., 1987, 1989; Saunders et al., 1998; Sengör and Burke, 1978; Ziegler and Cloetingh, 2004; Abdelmalak et al., 2016a, 2016b) (Figure F1).  

Expedition 396 builds on previous successful drilling campaigns in the northeast Atlantic (DSD P Leg 38 [1974] and ODP Legs 104 [1985], 152 [1993], and 163 [1995]) that were instrumental i n developing the concepts of volcanic rifted margins and large igneous provinces (LIPs) (se e Mahoney and Coffin [1997], Ernst [2014], and Svensen et al. [2019] for a summary). There are, however, many unresolved scientific questions related to the formation and environmental implications of breakup volcanism that can only be addressed by scientific drilling.  

Despite unsurpassed constraints on conjugate crustal structure between the northeast Atlanti c Norwegian, Jan Mayen, and Greenland rifted margins, the mechanisms behind rift-related, anomalous excess magmatic productivity are still debated (Lundin and Doré, 2005; Brown and Lesher, 2014; Foulger et al., 2020; Lu and Huismans, 2021). The controversy centers on three competin g hypotheses:  

• Excess magmatism derived from elevated mantle potential temperatures resulting from mantle plume processes,   
• Small-scale convection at the base of the lithosphere enhancing the flux of material through the melt window during rifting and breakup, and   
• Mantle source heterogeneity contributing to anomalously high melt production during continental breakup.  

Although the mantle plume mechanism requires anomalous high temperatures resulting in hig h degrees of melting during asthenosphere upwelling, small-scale convection at the base of the lithosphere operates without involving significantly elevated potential temperatures and is inherentl y connected to the rifting process (Boutilier and Keen, 1999).  

Temporal correlations between mass extinctions, global warming, and formation of LIPs have lon g been recognized but rarely demonstrated (only in the case of the late Permian extinctions) (Vogt, 1972; Eldholm and Thomas, 1993; Wignall, 2001). However, the reasons for the paleoenvironmental crises are highly debated (Bond and Wignall, 2014; Courtillot and Renne, 2003). For example, volcanic eruptions release large volumes of sulfur, halogens, and carbon to the atmosphere (Jone s et al., 2016), which may cause environmental disturbances on a variety of timescales. A potentia l complementary but perhaps asynchronous mechanism is that large volumes of greenhouse gase s can be released from metamorphic aureoles around sill intrusions emplaced in sedimentary basin s (Svensen et al., 2004). New information on eruption styles, volumes and rates, and sedimentological data in a proximal region to the eruptions is important to document and understand the environmental impact of LIP emplacement.

# 2. Background  

Scientific drilling of northeast Atlantic continental margins since the 1970s has been essential fo r understanding the architecture and implications of igneous deposits associated with continenta l breakup. In particular, drilling of deep boreholes in the feather edge of the seaward-dipping reflectors (SDRs) offshore mid-Norway and southeast Greenland (Eldholm et al., 1989; Larsen, Saunders, Clift, et al., 1994; Duncan, Larsen, Allan, et al., 1996; Saunders et al., 1998; Larsen et al., 1999 ) demonstrated that voluminous subaerial volcanic sequences are common along rifted margins. The drilling results further suggested that continental breakup magmatism has had a majo r impact on the global environment and mass extinctions (Hinz, 1981; Eldholm and Thomas, 1993). Interpretation of industry seismic and borehole data from the Vøring Basin later led to the hypothesis that voluminous intrusion of magma in organic-rich sedimentary basin deposits may hav e triggered the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) by release of aureole gases throug h hydrothermal vent complexes (Svensen et al., 2004). This hypothesis will be tested with the result s of Expedition 396.  

Breakup volcanism along rifted passive margins is highly variable in both time and space. Mantl e melting during the formation of mid-oceanic ridges is relatively well understood and mostly  a function of spreading rate and mantle potential temperature with melting below the mid-oceani c ridge. It leads to accretion of $6{-}8\;\mathrm{km}$ of magmatic crust at standard mantle potential temperatur e and full spreading rates larger than $2\;\mathrm{cm/y}$ (Bown and White, 1994). On the other hand, factor s controlling magmatic activity during continental rifting and breakup are not well known. The variation in the degree of magmatism at rifted margins can, to the first order, be characterized in thre e contrasting modes of behavior (e.g., Huismans and Beaumont, 2011, 2014; Lu and Huismans, 2021). Mode 1 margins are characterized by a sharp transition from the continent/ocean boundar y (COB) to normal thickness $(6{-}8\ \mathrm{km})$ magmatic ocean crust. At Mode 2 margins, magmatic productivity exceeds that expected from decompression melting at normal mantle temperature. Mode 3 margins have little to no magmatism at the COB and a broad transition zone with a n exposed mantle at the seafloor preceding formation of mature oceanic crust.  

A comprehensive understanding of what controls this range of behaviors and the volume, distribution, and timing of magmatism during continental rifting and breakup is, however, lacking. Exces s magmatism at volcanic Mode 2 margins, such as in the northeast Atlantic, has been related t o mantle plume and contrasting nonplume mechanisms (McKenzie and Bickle, 1988; Mutter et al., 1988; White and McKenzie, 1989).  

Continental breakup may be associated with extensive volcanism over large distances along strik e of the rifted margins, as exemplified in the northeast Atlantic (Figure F1). Magmatic product s emplaced along these volcanic rifted margins have four major characteristics:  

• Wedges of SDRs and associated volcanic seismic facies units interpreted to be massive subaerial and submarine Lava Flows and volcaniclastic sediments are found on both sides of the COB.   
• Extensive sill and hydrothermal vent complexes are emplaced in organic-rich sedimentary basins around the incipient breakup axis.   
• Thick high–seismic velocity bodies are found in the lower crust along the COB and commonly interpreted to be magmatic underplated material.   
• Extensive pre- to synrifting volcanic sequences comprising subaerial lava flows, lava deltas, and volcaniclastic sediments.  

Magmatic crustal thickening at these margins often exceeds $20\,\mathrm{km}$ , more than three times as thic k as normal oceanic crust produced by passive upwelling of normal potential temperature mantle.  

It appears that volcanic rifted margins require mantle that is either (1) anomalously hot, (2) actively upwelling at rates higher than the plate half-spreading rate, (3) anomalously fertile, o r (4) some combination of these factors.  

# 2.1. Geological setting  

The northeast Atlantic rift system developed as a result of a series of rift episodes succeeding th e Caledonian orogeny that ultimately led to continental breakup and passive margin formation i n the earliest Eocene (Talwani and Eldholm, 1977; White and McKenzie, 1989; Skogseid et al., 2000; Abdelmalak et al., 2016a; Zastrozhnov et al., 2020). The mid-Norwegian Margin is well covered b y 2-D and 3-D reflection and refraction seismic surveys, potential field and heat flow data, and borehole data that allow a refined structural and stratigraphic framework (Figure F2) (Brekke, 2000; Gernigon et al., 2003, 2020, 2021; Mjelde et al., 2005; Breivik et al., 2006; Theissen-Krah et al., 2017; Zastrozhnov et al., 2018, 2020; Polteau et al., 2020).  

The mid-Norwegian Margin is segmented by the northwest-trending Jan Mayen Fracture Zone, which separates the Møre and Vøring Margins (Figure F3). The margin segments are characterized by different tectonomagmatic style and sediment distribution (Berndt et al., 2001a; Gernigo n et al., 2020). The largest magmatic accumulation is observed in the Vøring segment, and volume s decrease to the south and north (Millett et al., 2020b). In the southern segment, passive margi n formation and oceanic spreading was accommodated by the Aegir Ridge between the Møre an d Jan Mayen (at the time connected to Greenland) conjugate margins in the Paleocene and Eocene.  

Rifting and passive margin formation in the northeast Atlantic was accompanied by strong volcanic activity (White and McKenzie, 1989; Eldholm and Grue, 1994; Larsen and Saunders, 1998; Wright et al., 2012). Evidence for extensive magmatism is provided by SDRs, magmatic intrusions, and high-velocity bodies at the base of the continental crust underlying the COB, which in th e distal margin are unequivocally interpreted to be magmatic underplate (Figures F2, F3) (Berndt e t al., 2001a; Mjelde et al., 2005; Planke et al., 2005). ODP drilling of the Vøring Margin (Leg 104) an d off southeast Greenland (Legs 152 and 163) recovered volcanic rock successions erupted durin g the initial stages of opening of the northeast Atlantic. Drilled rocks range from prebreakup continental tholeiitic flood basalt to synbreakup picrites to oceanic-type basalts that form the main par t of the SDRs (Fitton et al., 2000). Oceanic-type lavas show an increasing degree of melting an d contribution from asthenospheric mantle sources with time (Fram et al., 1998; Fitton et al., 1998). Thickness of igneous crust accreted at the southeast Greenland COB increases from about $18\,\mathrm{km}$ in the south to about $30~\mathrm{km}$ near the Greenland-Iceland Rise (Holbrook et al., 2001). Similarly, geochemical enrichment of volcanic rocks of the East Greenland Margin (chondrite-normalize d $\mathrm{[Ce/Y]N}$ and isotopes; Fitton et al., 1998; Tegner et al., 1998; Brown and Lesher, 2014) increase s from south to north. In addition to scientific drilling results, evidence from the thick onshor e Faroe Islands and East Greenland exposures reveal a temporal evolution that supports fluctuations in mantle potential temperature with time (e.g., Tegner et al., 1998; Millett et al., 2020a). Temporal fluctuations in mantle potential temperature are also invoked from independent geophysical observations, which reveal major uplift and subsidence events during the North Atlanti c Igneous Province (NAIP) history that have been invoked as evidence for plume pulsing within th e province (e.g. Champion et al., 2008; Hartley et al., 2011; Parnell-Turner et al., 2014).  

Correlation of crustal thickness and compositional enrichment suggests a combination of change s in source composition, source temperature, and/or melting dynamics (Hole and Millett, 2016; Hole and Natland, 2020, among others). It is not known whether a similar correlation of crusta l thicknesses and magma compositions exists along the Norwegian Margin. To establish the relationship between chemistry of the volcanic successions and crustal configuration is a milestone o f the proposed investigations. Geochemical data show strong chemical and isotopic similaritie s between the “upper series” from the Vøring Plateau and southeast Greenland. In contrast, th e “lower series” from both areas are fundamentally different from each other in many aspects, pointing to either substantial differences in prebreakup lithosphere composition at the two localities o r different styles of mantle-crust interaction (Abdelmalak et al., 2016a).

Periods of elevated magmatism such as the emplacement of the NAIP often coincide with considerable environmental perturbations such as the PETM (56 Ma) and/or long-term climate warmin g such as the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) $({\sim}50{-}53\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , suggesting a causal relationship (Bond and Wignall, 2014; Eldholm and Thomas, 1993). The total volume of magma emplace d during the Paleogene is estimated to be $6{-}10\times10^{6}\,\mathrm{km}^{3}$ (Saunders et al., 2007; Horni et al., 2017), with the most voluminous activity roughly coinciding with the Paleocene/Eocene boundary (Storey et al., 2007a), although the full emplacement spans several million years (Wilkinson et al., 2017). Greenhouse gas emissions were likely generated by magmatic degassing (Storey et al., 2007b; Gutjahr et al., 2017) and by explosive discharge of thermogenic gases generated by contac t metamorphism (Svensen et al., 2004; Frieling et al., 2016; Aarnes et al., 2010). Therefore, th e emplacement of the NAIP is one of the primary contenders for instigating hyperthermal event s and long-term warming in the Paleogene, either as a direct forcing or as an instigator of positiv e climate feedbacks such as methane hydrate dissociation.

# 3. Scientific objectives  

The key objective of Expedition 396 is to understand the relationship between rifting, excess magmatism, and paleoclimate and to resolve the relative contribution from plume upwelling, small - scale convection, and mantle heterogeneity and their relation to the formation of volcanic rifte d margins in the northeast Atlantic. This requires additional constraints on the following:  

• Melting conditions (degree, pressure, and temperature of melting);   
• Age distribution of volcanic products, which is essential to constrain magmatic productivity in time and space;   
• Variation of pre-, syn-, and postbreakup magmatic activity across the margin;   
• Variation of magmatic activity along strike across the major Møre and Vøring Margin segments;   
• Eruption rates, environment, and basalt morphologies; and   
• The relationship between climate change and timing, volume, and style of magma emplacement.  

The sedimentary proxy-based environmental reconstruction likely provides a semiquantitative record of paleoelevations (water depth) and vertical motions as early rifting progresses to seafloo r spreading, with the potential additional influence of dynamic support originating from the plumepulsing hypothesis (e.g., Champion et al., 2008; Parnell-Turner et al., 2014).  

Sampling of breakup volcanic successions and proximal sediment cores through IODP drilling, i n conjunction with geochemical constraints on melt conditions and integrated quantitative model s of melting and mantle convection, is crucial to advance our understanding of breakup processe s and resolve competing hypotheses for excess magmatism and paleoenvironmental consequences.  

The mid-Norwegian Margin is a unique area in which well-characterized volcanic features, relate d to volcanic rifted margins worldwide, are readily drillable (Figure F2). Here, igneous rocks an d Paleogene sediments are locally buried by minor postbreakup sediments. Large regions along th e outer margins have recently been covered by industry 3-D seismic surveys, and this unique database allows the identification of shallow $\left.<200\right.$ meters below seafloor [mbsf]) volcanic and Paleogene sedimentary targets.  

There are seven main scientific objectives for Expedition 396:  

Objective 1 (primary): determine the role of the Iceland plume in producing excess magm a along the mid-Norwegian segment of the northeast Atlantic volcanic rifted margin during th e Paleogene by constraining the conditions of melting (temperature, pressure, mantle sources, an d total degree of melting).  

# Objective 2 (primary): determine the cause for along-axis variation in melt production.  

In the case of the northeast Atlantic volcanic margins, magmatic productivity changes from th e Møre Margin $\scriptstyle\sim12-15\;\mathrm{km}$ thick magmatic crust) in the south toward the Vøring Margin $>\!20\,\mathrm{km}$ thick magmatic crust) and the Lofoten Margin ( $\mathbf{\left\langle{\sim8}\ k m\right.}$ regular thickness magmatic crust). Thi s pattern suggests a local, structural control because plume models would suggest largest exces s magmatic activity in the southernmost conjugate sections (e.g., Møre–Jan Mayen) closest to th e Iceland thermal anomaly.  

Objective 3 (primary): determine the depositional environment (subaerial vs. submarine) o f Inner and Outer Lava Flows (e.g., SDRs) and implications for vertical motions during late synrift, breakup, and early postrift oceanic spreading.  

Some of the Lava Flows may not have extruded subaerially (e.g., Planke et al., 2000, 2017). This ha s important implications for the distribution of buoyancy forces and isostasy during breakup wher e sections without continental crust would under normal conditions be expected at water depth s $>\!2\,\mathrm{km}$ (e.g., Kusznir et al., 2004).  

Objective 4 (primary): determine the timing of magmatic activity and potential relationship(s ) through analysis of a large variety of paleoenvironmental proxies proximal to the NAIP.  

Objective 5 (primary): use the integrated paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental proxies an d geochronological data to assess the relative importance of volcanism and thermogenic releas e from hydrothermal vent complexes as potential drivers of climate change events.  

Objective 6 (secondary): study early Eocene hothouse and freshwater incursions into the Nort h Atlantic.  

Scientific justification: the early Paleogene $\langle{\sim}66{-}45\ \mathrm{Ma}\rangle$ ) was characterized by warm global greenhouse conditions culminating in the EECO $({\sim}53{-}50\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , the warmest sustained climates of th e last 65 My (Bijl et al., 2009; Anagnostou et al., 2016; Cramwinckel et al., 2018), inducing an intensified hydrological cycle with strongly increased precipitation at high latitudes (e.g., Pagani et al., 2006; Suan et al., 2017). Paleogene sediments obtained during Integrated Ocean Drilling Progra m Expedition 302 (Arctic Coring Expedition) show large quantities of free-floating freshwater azolla, which grew and reproduced in the Arctic Ocean by the onset of the middle Eocene $(\sim\!48\,\mathrm{\,Ma})$ (Brinkhuis et al., 2006). The drilled sites penetrate the Eocene sediments and will allow testing o f the extent of freshwater incursions, constraining paleoceanographic boundary conditions for th e excursions, including the evolution of oceanic gateways and their influence on global ocean circulation. The early Eocene sediments also provide a unique opportunity to reconstruct norther n mid–high latitude climate, allowing a detailed comparison to Southern Ocean records (e.g., Bijl e t al., 2009, 2013; Hollis et al., 2012).  

# Objective 7 (secondary): study carbon capture and storage in basalt provinces.  

Industrial scale injection of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ into volcanic reservoirs has been developed in recent years wit h test sites on Iceland (Matter et al., 2016) and in Washington State (USA) (McGrail et al., 2011). Carbon capture and storage is an integral component of meeting climate change targets of th e Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and as such, the extensive offshore volcani c sequences of the mid-Norwegian volcanic rifted margin form potential storage targets (Planke e t al., 2021). Better petrophysical and geophysical constraints on the volcanic rock sequences collected during Expedition 396 are needed to effectively appraise the reservoir properties and storage potential in this area.  

Observations of meteoric water and high dissolved calcium concentration from the bottom o f ODP Sites 642 and 643 show that the Vøring Plateau is ideal for studying circulation of freshwate r in such large basaltic formations and assessing its potential for $C O_{2}$ sequestration. Previous OD P holes did not address the origin of meteoric water and trigger(s) for such large-scale circulation. Dating of borehole water samples with $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ , $^{36}\mathrm{Cl}$ , and $^{234}\mathrm{U}/^{238}\mathrm{U}$ tracers and systematic analyses o f fluid geochemistry (Inagaki et al., 2015) will allow the determination of the source of meteori c waters and provide constraints on their circulation systems, which are crucial for assessing th e ${\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ storage potential of breakup basalts. Pore fluids have been sampled along the complete drilling transect to investigate the potential extent of meteoric water flow. The outcome of fluid geochemical analyses will be quantitatively interpreted with hydrological modeling using softwar e such as MODFLOW to investigate the flow path of meteoric water. The sampling for water geochemistry will follow the standard IODP protocol for pore fluid analyses.  

# 4. Operations and coring strategy  

The mid-Norwegian Margin is the type locality for volcanic rifted margins and is probably the bes t studied volcanic margin worldwide. The detailed geometry and amount of volcanic products i n the form of underplated bodies and intrusive and extrusive volcanic rocks are well constraine d through geophysical imaging (e.g., Mjelde et al., 2005; Berndt et al., 2001b; Planke et al., 2017; Abdelmalak et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2017). However, new information on the age, nature, and depositional environment of the volcanic rocks is required to constrain melt production rates and vertical motions.  

Answering the fundamental questions outlined in the scientific objectives required extensive sampling of both late synrift/early postrift sediments and magmatic products from the continenta l into the oceanic domain (Figures F2, F3). Collection of sedimentary records proximal to the volcanic and magmatic activity will allow to use numerous proxies (e.g., geochemical and sedimentological) to distinguish between volcanic and hydrothermal vent complex sources.  

The expedition sites were located based on interpretation of very extensive high-quality moder n 3-D data and locally 2-D profiles where 3-D data did not exist (Millett et al., 2020b; Gernigon et al., 2021). All proposed sites were located in regions with thin post-Eocene sediments. Site-specifi c high-resolution 2-D and 3-D P-Cable seismic data were subsequently acquired in 2020 across si x of the approved sites (Bünz, 2020).  

The expedition boreholes are located along three transects:  

• Modgunn transect • Targeting the crater of hydrothermal vent complex • 5 boreholes (2 sites)   
• Mimir transect • Targeting Paleogene sediments and the PETM • 5 boreholes (2 sites)   
• Basement transect (Kolga, Skoll, Eldhø, and Lofoten Basin areas) • Targeting both basalt and interbasalt sediments, prebasalt, and postbasalt sequences • 11 boreholes (6 sites)  

Drilling was highly successful, with clement weather, operations, and core recovery. In total, 2 1 holes were drilled at 10 different sites (Table T1). The total drilling depth was $3950\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , includin g more than $600\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of basement rocks. Overall recovery was $57\%$ ; however, the recovery of ke y PETM and basalt stratigraphic intervals was as high as $78\%$ and $61\%$ , respectively. A comprehensive suite of wireline logs were collected in eight boreholes, with a logged interval of $913\,\textrm{m}$ .  A summary of the drilling and logging results from the sites are presented in Figure F4 and locate d along a volcanic margins sketch in Figure F2. The coring results for each of the main recovere d stratigraphic units is presented in Table T2, and a summary of the wireline logging intervals i s presented in Table T3.  

Paleogene sediments were drilled along the 1 and $3\,\mathrm{km}$ long Modgunn and Mimir transects (Figures F5, F6). Initially, the primary sites were drilled in both these areas. Initial results from th e coring operations, including palynological analyses and physical property interpretations, wer e integrated with revised interpretation of the high-resolution P-Cable 3-D seismic data to refin e the location of additional holes to optimize recovery of the targeted sedimentary strata (e.g., th e PETM interval).  

The drilling strategy for the basement transect was somewhat more complicated because severa l different areas along the margin were targeted (Figure F2). The two Kolga sites targeted subbasal t and initial basalt sequences, followed by the two Skoll sites, which targeted different volcanic seismic facies units and sequences near the feather-edge of the SDRs (Figure F7A). Farther north, th e Eldhø (Figure F7B) and Lofoten Basin sites targeted the characteristic Outer High and Outer SD R volcanic seismic facies units, respectively. A summary of the drilling and logging results from th e sites are presented in Figure F3.  

All basement sites were initially drilled using the rotary core barrel (RCB) coring system for optimal basalt recovery (Figure F4). The main site objectives were typically $^{100}\,\mathrm{m}$ of basement drillin g or drilling to bit destruction. Half-coring was used extensively in the basement intervals t o improve recovery. Wireline logs were acquired in most basement holes; the main objective was t o image interbasalt sediments and fracture intervals that are difficult to recover with the RCB system. The advanced piston corer (APC)/extended core barrel (XCB) coring system was used a t three basement sites (two at Skoll and Eldhø) to optimize recovery of the Eocene sedimentar y rocks. APC coring was guided and constrained by results from the somewhat limited recovery i n previously drilled RCB holes at each site. HLAPC coring was again used extensively to ensure hig h recovery in critical intervals. This approach gave an almost complete recovery of the postbasal t sediments at two sites.  

The typical IODP shipboard workflow, including core description, imaging, physical propert y measurements, and geochemical analyses of rocks and fluids, was followed by the shipboard scientists and IODP staff. Headspace gas was routinely analyzed for safety reasons. Interstitial wate r (IW) and microbiological samples were also obtained soon after core recovery. Table T4 gives a n overview of the comprehensive amount of data acquired in the targeted stratigraphic interval s during the cruise. Figures F8, F9, F10, F11, F12, and F13 highlight results from the different shipboard laboratories (biostratigraphy, core description, geochemistry, wireline logging, and paleomagnetism groups).

# 5.1.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1565 (proposed Site VMVM-20A) is located at 2071 m below sea level (mbsl) on the wester n flank of the Kolga High, a pronounced structural high in the Jan Mayen Corridor (Figure F14). Th e site was located using a combination of conventional 3-D and high-resolution seismic data. Comprehensive 3-D seismic mapping shows that the Kolga High is covered by a variable-thicknes s Paleogene basalt unit overlying a complex and previously untested subbasalt sequence that ha d been interpreted as potentially sedimentary because of the presence of local intrusions of Paleogene sills and dikes (Millett et al., 2020b; Zastrozhnov et al., 2020). SDR wedges exist on the Mør e Marginal High toward the south, and similar, but smaller, seismic reflections lap onto the wester n part of the Kolga High. A classic lava delta and escarpment defines the eastern limit of the high. The basalt cover is absent in two small ( $\bar{5}\times3$ km sized) areas just west of the summit of the Kolg a High (Millett et al., 2020b). Here, the seismic data show a transparent seismic basement tha t extends down to a strong seismic reflection at about $7.5~\mathbf{s}$ two-way traveltime (TWT). The gap i n the basalt cover makes the Kolga High a unique place on the Vøring and Møre Margins where th e subbasalt sequence can be sampled with shallow coring.  

The primary objective of Site U1565 was to core and sample the subbasalt geology that is largel y unconstrained along the mid-Norwegian Margin. Sampling the subbasalt succession would provide important constraints on the rifting history both in time and space as well as constraints o n the vertical movements of this margin segment prior to breakup (Gernigon et al., 2015, 2020). W e expected to sample the subbasalt rocks after penetrating about $25{-}30\ \mathrm{m}$ of Neogene sediments. The plan was to core for 2 days or to a maximum depth of 200 mbsf to recover representativ e samples of the basement rocks to characterize the lithologies and alternation. As we encountere d altered granitic basement immediately below the soft sediment cover in Hole U1565A, we decide d to drill a second hole approximately $^{140}\,\mathrm{m}$ to the west to verify the lateral continuity of the basement rocks rather than spending time deepening the initial hole at a very low penetration rate.  

# 5.1.2. Operations  

Site U1565 consisted of two shallow holes. Hole U1565A was cored using the RCB system to 28. 0 mbsf. Coring was stopped because of very slow penetration rates while drilling into granite tha t was sampled in Cores 396-U1565A-3R and 4R. With the objective to confirm the lateral extent o f the granite, Hole U1565B was added to the plan. This hole was drilled $138\,\mathrm{m}$ west-northwest of th e first hole, in the direction of the next site (U1566). Hole U1565B was cored to 31.7 mbsf an d yielded similar core material as Hole U1565A. Operations were ended at $0215\ \mathrm{h}$ on 16 Augus t

2021, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor to begin the short transit of $900\;\mathrm{m}$ to th e next site.  

Nine cores were recorded for the site. The RCB system was used exclusively. It cored $59.7~\mathrm{m}$ an d recovered $19.66\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(32.9\%)$ . A total of $34.25\,\mathrm{h}$ or 1.4 days were spent on Site U1565.

# 5.1.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The lithology of Holes U1565A and U1565B is divided into two lithostratigraphic units. Unit  I consists of unconsolidated sediment, and Unit II consists of altered granite. The boundar y between the two units was determined using the drilling data where the bit depth shows a shar p decrease in the rate of penetration from about $15\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{h}$ to $1{-}2\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{h}$ at 20.9 mbsf in U1565A and 28. 0 mbsf in U1565B. The thickness of granite drilled in Holes U1565A and U1565B is $7.1\;\mathrm{m}$ and $3.6\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , respectively. Unit I is $7.1\;\mathrm{m}$ thinner in Hole U1565A than in Hole U1565B. High-resolution seismi c data show that the expected sediment thickness is the same in both holes. The thickness discrepancy in the drilling data is attributed to uncertainties in the determination of the seabed depth fo r RCB drilling because seabed depth was determined using the increase in torque in Hole U1565 A and the mudline recovery in Hole U1565B.

Unit I sediments in Hole U1565A are primarily composed of olive brown to reddish-brown clay, whereas Unit I in Hole U1565B is mainly composed of brown, grayish brown to dark gray clay. Generally, this unit contains varying amounts of silt, sand, calcareous nannofossils and planktoni c foraminifers, with diatoms common in the first core section of Hole U1565A. Amphibolite an d granite dropstones also are observed in this core. The unit is overall moderately to very wel l sorted. Smear slide analyses indicate that Unit I consists of abundant undifferentiated clay-size d minerals, rare to trace foraminifers and nannofossils with larger silt and sand-sized grains comprised of common quartz and undifferentiated feldspar, and rare lithics. Trace amounts of diatoms, zircon, chlorite, and glauconite are also present. Slight to moderate drilling disturbance s were observed in parts of the unit. The base of Unit I in Hole U1565B directly above Unit II consists of a mixture of sand, subrounded yellow brown clay clasts, and granules to medium pebble s with a poorly sorted grain size. Smear slide analysis of matrix material from this interval indicate s abundant undifferentiated clay-sized minerals with rare nannofossils, rare organic debris, an d trace diatoms. Silt and sand grains consist of common undifferentiated feldspar, rare quartz, an d rare lithics. Dark gray polymetallic concentric nodules were observed at the base of Unit I in Hol e U1565A (interval 396-U1565A-2R-1, $75{-}79\,\mathrm{cm}$ ). pXRF data collected from nodules at ${\sim}5.80$ mbs f (Section 2R-CC) show that their composition consists of low to moderate concentrations of transition metals $\mathrm{[10.7\,wt\%}$ $\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}},$ 2.6 wt% ${\cal M}{\bf n}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3},$ 210 ppm Ni, 80 ppm Cu, and 94 ppm Zn). The silic a content $(\sim\!35\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ is considered relatively high for such nodules and suggests the presence of cla y materials.

The transition between Units I and II was not retrieved in Hole U1565A. Based on the low penetration rates and drilling data, we cored $7.1\textrm{m}$ into Unit II in Hole U1565A, recovering more tha n $3\textrm{m}$ of granite. In Hole U1565B, the transition between the two units was recovered in Core 4R, and we cored $3.6\;\mathrm{m}$ into basement, recovering only 10 pebbles and a $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ core of highly altere d granite conglomerate. Unit II represents one igneous lithologic unit consisting of moderately t o highly altered medium-grained biotite granite with local mafic or felsic enclaves (Figure F10G). Throughout Unit II, the granite rocks remain mineralogically and texturally consistent. Discret e fine-grained enclaves are present in parts of Unit II. Observations of two thin sections confirme d the mineralogy and pervasive alteration observed at macroscopic scale. Alkali feldspars are generally partially or totally replaced by undetermined brownish clay minerals and zeolite. Biotite grain s show corona of limonite.  

# 5.1.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

Before hitting igneous materials, unconsolidated mixed gray and brown sands, silts, and clays wit h intervals containing gravel and larger clasts, interpreted as ice-rafted detritus, were recovere d from Lithostratigraphic Unit I in Holes U1565A and U1565B. Clay- and silt-rich samples fro m Sections 396-U1565A-1R-CC through 2-CC and 396-U1565B-1R-CC through 4R-CC were analyzed for microfossil content. All sedimentary samples yield common-to-trace diatoms, in situ an d reworked dinoflagellate cysts, reworked sporomorphs, rare ostracods, common-to-trace benthi c foraminifers, and common planktonic foraminifers. The age-diagnostic microfossils indicate a n overall Quaternary age. In addition, palynomorphs (mainly dinocysts) indicate reworking fro m Paleogene and (lower) Cretaceous strata, and pollen and spores also indicate reworking fro m lower Cretaceous rocks. Diatoms and foraminifers are common in the mudline samples and suggest a middle Pleistocene–Holocene age.  

# 5.1.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I sediments show consistent and continuous variations in inclination an d intensity despite drilling disturbance. Some of the locally high values of magnetic inclinatio n $(>\!80^{\circ})$ might be due to drilling-induced magnetization. The sediments have an average intensity o f $\small{\sim}3.6\times10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A/m},$ a magnetic susceptibility (MS) (Κ) of ${\sim}707\times10^{-6}\,\mathrm{SI}_{\mathrm{2}}$ , and a low magnetic anisotropy $P^{\prime}$ $(\sim\!1.001)$ . The nonhorizontal magnetic foliation suggests drilling disturbance. In Hole s U1565A and U1565B, the geomagnetic polarity is normal, except at 5.58–5.78 mbsf in Hol e U1565A, where a magnetic reversal may occur. The sediments have higher magnetic coercivit y than the granites. One discrete sample shows limited demagnetization up to a field of $100~\mathrm{{mT}}$ indicative of a high coercivity magnetic phase (goethite or hematite) and confirms the norma l polarity of this interval.  

Granites in Unit II have an average magnetic intensity of $1.17\,\times\,10^{-2}\,\,\mathrm{A/m},$ likely due to loss o f magnetite through alteration, a MS (K) of $212\times10^{-6}\,\mathrm{SI}_{:}$ , and a low degree of anisotropy $P^{\prime}\left({\sim}1.001\right)$ . Two discrete samples show a normal polarity and the presence of a low coercivity phase (magnetite, titanomagnetite, or maghemite) consistent with thermal remanent magnetization.  

# 5.1.3.4. Geochemistry  

Six interstitial water samples were collected from the subbasalt sequence in Hole U1565B. Sligh t increases in dissolved Cl, Ca, Na, and Si are documented with depth, whereas $\mathrm{Mg}$ and Li decreas e with depth. Little to no change is observed for K or Sr. Increasing $C\mathbf{a}$ and decreasing $\mathrm{Mg}$ coul d reflect the diagenetic alteration of volcanoclastic material or seawater-basalt interactions. Downcore increases in alkalinity, Mn, $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ , and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ are paired with decreasing $\mathsf{p H}$ and may reflec t microbially mediated oxidation of organic matter, although little change is observed for ${\mathrm{SO}}_{4}^{\ 2-}$ .  

Total carbon (TC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), calcium carbonate $\left(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\right)$ ), total organic carbo n (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and sulfur were determined on six discrete sediment samples. Bul k sediment TC and TN were determined by elemental analysis, and TIC was determined by coulometer. TIC content ranges from $1.25~\mathrm{wt\%}$ in the upper section of the cored sediments (0.09–2.9 1 mbsf) to below $0.01\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ with an average value of $0.69\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Assuming TIC is purely representativ e of $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ , values range from ${<}0.1\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ to $10.4\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ . TC varies between 0.2 and $1.6\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ (average $=$ $1.2\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ ). TOC is between 0.17 and $0.63\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ (average $=0.33\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ ) with no clear trend downcore. TOC/TN ratios are between 3 and 25 with an average value of 9, representative of primaril y marine organic matter. In all samples, S values are below detection limits.  

# 5.1.3.5. Physical properties  

Physical property data acquired at Site U1565 include density, MS, $P$ -wave velocity, natural gamm a radiation (NGR), color reflectance, X-ray imaging, thermal conductivity, and spectral imaging. Gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density of the sedimentary section varies from 1.4 to 1.7 9 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ . Moisture and density (MAD) measurements collected for each section yielded very simila r bulk density values (average $=1.69\,\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ , n. 11), and measured grain density values vary from 2.6 3 to $2.79\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ with an average of $2.72\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Porosities range from $9\%$ to $67\%$ , reflecting the sediment’s uncompacted nature. MS measured on whole rounds and split sections are very similar an d range from ${\sim}34\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ to $90\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ . A MS peak $\langle566\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}\rangle$ ) in Section 396-U1565A-1R- 1 correlates to a dropstone found in the core.  

Thermal conductivity measured at $40\,\mathrm{cm}$ in Section 396-U1565A-2R-1 yielded an average value o f 1.42 W/(m·K). NGR values for the sedimentary unit vary from 27.7 to 38.1 counts/s with an average of 33 counts/s. A MAD sample collected at $61\,{\mathrm{cm}}$ in Section 2R-1 yielded a bulk density of 1.7 8 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , grain density of $2.7\;\mathbf{g}/\mathbf{cm}^{3}$ , and porosity of $55\%$ . $P$ -wave velocity measured at $60\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ in Section 2R-1 using the Section Half Measurement Gantry (SHMG) resulted in $1530~\mathrm{m/s}$ in the $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{x}}.$ - direction and $1510\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ in the $\boldsymbol{z}$ -direction.  

Cores 396-U1565A-3R and 4R penetrated granitic basement. The average GRA bulk density of th e hard rocks in these core sections is $2.275~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , yielding a bulk density of $2.56~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ after a line r correction is applied, which agrees with the three MAD samples collected from these cores. MA D measurements revealed relatively high porosities of $\mathord{\sim}10\%$ in the granite cubes. MS values in th e hard rocks are significantly lower than those of the overlying sediments (0 to $22\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ ).  

# 5.2. Site U1566  

A complete section of the feather edge of an SDR sequence below a thin Quaternary sediment uni t was recovered at Site U1566. The basalt flows and interbasalt sediment units were deposited in  a subaerial environment and overlie the weathered granitic basement sampled at Site U1566.  

# 5.2.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1566 (proposed Site VMVM-23A) is a companion site to Site U1565. Both sites are locate d on the western flank of the Kolga High (Figure F14) about $1\,\mathrm{km}$ apart at a water depth just abov e $2000\;\mathrm{m}$ . As described for Site U1565, the Kolga High is one of several areas along the rifted margi n that are characterized by a thin sediment cover above the top basalt surface and a rapidly westwar d shoaling of the Base Cretaceous Unconformity (BCU) (Zastrozhnov et al., 2020).  

Interpretation of extensive 3-D seismic reflection data shows that the Kolga High is covered b y breakup related basalts except for two small windows $\mathit{\Delta}5\times3$ km sized) just west of the summit o f the Kolga High (Millett et al., 2020b). Characteristic SDRs lap onto the Kolga High along its western margin, thinning toward the basalt windows where the lavas most likely have been eroded, making the Kolga High one of the few sites along the Vøring and Møre Margins where the transition from the lowermost extrusive volcanic rocks to the subbasalt strata is accessible by drilling.  A previous attempt to determine the nature of this boundary was carried out during ODP Leg 104 i n 1985 on the Vøring Marginal High. Hole 642E showed that the SDRs represent thick piles of subaerially emplaced basalt flows (Eldholm et al., 1989; Planke, 1994), but unfortunately did not ge t through the entire lava pile. The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) drilled the eastern par t of the Kolga High in 2014 (Hole 6403/1-U-1) and recovered $38\;\mathrm{m}$ of hyaloclastite with a tholeiiti c composition (Bakke, 2017) in the upper part of a lava delta, as defined by eastward progradin g reflections, but did not penetrate through the entire extrusive volcanic sequence.  

The primary objective of Site U1566 was to sample the lowermost part of the SDRs on the Kolg a High and, if possible, drill through the entire basalt sequence, but this was not the primary targe t because the nearby Site U1565 targeted the subbasalt units. By drilling Site U1566 we first aime d to determine the emplacement environment of the initial volcanism on the Kolga High because i t provides important constraints on the vertical movement of the margin prior to the onset of extrusive volcanism and the extension during the final rifting phase prior to breakup. A second objective at Site U1566 was to constrain the timing of the onset of extrusive volcanism in this area an d to provide further insights into the hypothesis that breakup and extrusive volcanism on the Mør e Margin predated breakup along the Vøring Margin (e.g, Gernigon et al., 2003). A third objective o f Site U1566 was to characterize the magma source of the earliest extrusive basalts and determin e whether it was primordial, which would imply rapid ascent through the crust, or it evolved durin g storage at crustal levels with potential incorporation of continental crustal rocks. A fourth objective was to constrain the rates of magma production both from geochemical analyses and potentially by biostratigraphic dating of interlayered sediments. The final objective of Site U1566 was t o gather information on the extent of the basement lithologies drilled at Site U1565 and on lava– subsurface interaction if the bottom of the lava pile could be reached. Although Site U1566 wa s placed only $1\;\mathrm{km}$ away from Site U1565, the seismic data were inconclusive about the dip of th e basal surface of the lava pile and hence the depth to this interface.  

# 5.2.2. Operations  

Site U1566 consisted of a single hole cored to 181.7 mbsf and wireline logging. Coring started a t $0525\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 August 2021 and ended at $2230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 August to accommodate the Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI) logging run in daylight hours on 20 August. A total of 33 cores were taken usin g the RCB system, recovering $100.5\mathrm{~m~}(55\%)$ of core. Cores 396-U1566A-1R through 3R and 32R– 33R were taken with full-length advances. Cores 4R (26.2 mbsf) through 31R (162.3 mbsf) wer e taken with half-length advances to improve core recovery of the basaltic basement.  

All four logging tool strings, the triple combination (triple combo), VSI, Formation MicroScanne r (FMS)-sonic tool, and Ultrasonic Borehole Imager (UBI) tool strings, were run to 145 mbsf in th e hole. After the wireline logging concluded, the drill string was pulled back to the surface an d secured, ending Hole U1566A and Site U1566 at $0230~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 August. The time spent on Hol e U1566A was $124\,\mathrm{{h}}$ or 5.2 days.  

# 5.2.3. Principal results  

# 5.2.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The succession recovered at Site U1566 is divided into three lithostratigraphic units. Unit I (0–1 9 mbsf) is unconsolidated clay with varying amounts of silt and sand as well as foraminifers. Some o f the intervals contain clasts and nodules. Unit II (19–148 mbsf) is basalt and interbasaltic sediment. This unit is divided into 14 igneous subunits and 13 sedimentary subunits and has a tota l cored thickness of $121.8\;\mathrm{m}$ . Each igneous subunit is composed of one to several discrete lava flows. The dominant facies is aphyric basalt with rare microphenocrysts of plagioclase characterized b y variable vesicularity (Figure F10). The chemostratigraphy of the igneous subunits obtained usin g pXRF shows significant and abrupt variations of the magma composition downhole. Unit III (148– $175.4\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) is weakly to moderately altered medium-grained granite with biotite alternating wit h decomposed granite and granite derived sandstones (Figure F10).  

# 5.2.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

Sedimentary samples analyzed from the first three cores in Hole U1566A yield common to trac e diatoms and other biosiliceous debris, trace in situ dinoflagellate cysts, sporomorphs, rar e ostracods, common to trace benthic foraminifers, and common planktonic foraminifers. Agediagnostic microfossils indicate an overall Quaternary age for the sedimentary deposits above th e uppermost igneous facies.  

In addition, a single sample taken from sediments interbedded between igneous rocks in Sectio n 396-U1566A-11R-1 yielded a diverse terrestrial pollen and spore assemblage as well as a fe w aquatic elements. Age-diagnostic pollen encountered at this level suggest an earliest Eocene ag e for this sample.  

# 5.2.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Core sections were run through the superconducting rock magnetometer, which measured natural remanent magnetization (NRM) before and after alternating field (AF) demagnetization. Core s  

396-U1566A-1R through 3R show normal polarity, followed by reversed polarity from Core 4R t o the bottom of the hole, with some data points showing evidence of normal polarity. Lithostratigraphic Unit I has an average initial intensity of magnetization (NRM) of $4.3\times10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ . The average NRM of Units II and III is ${\sim}1.4\,\mathrm{A/m},$ , which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of th e sediments.  

Stepwise demagnetization was conducted on 32 discrete samples from Hole U1566A (therma l demagnetization) with a focus on unaltered basalt flow samples (30 samples). One sediment an d one granite unit sample were also analyzed. The basalt sequence records mostly a reverse magnetic polarity.  

# 5.2.3.4. Geochemistry  

Alkalinity increases from the mudline $(2.3\mathrm{~mM})$ to the deepest IW sample taken at 18 mbsf (3. 1 mM) in Hole U1566A. Measured $\mathsf{p H}$ is 7.8 in the mudline and declines to 7.7 at the base of th e sediments. $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ content ranges from $4.04~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at 2.95 mbsf to $2.16~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at 18 mbsf. Ammoniu m $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{\;\;+}\right)$ ) is below detection limit in the mudline but increases to $56.6\;\mathrm{mM}$ in the deepest sample.  

The hard rock samples recovered from Hole U1566A (Unit II) are mostly subalkaline basalt, wit h one picro-basalt, and three samples from Unit III are dacite to ryolite. Comparison of the dat a obtained from ICP-AES with pXRF analysis with basalts from the upper series in ODP Hole 642 E (Meyer et al., 2009) and flood basalts from East Greenland (Tegner et al., 1998) indicates an overlap of most samples from Site U1566 with the low-Ti basalts of Greenland (Figure F11). Anothe r two samples from Unit III show compositions of a high-K granite (Rickwood, 1989), consisten t with the high proportion of alkali feldspar, with a typical signature of an A-type granitoid (Frost e t al., 2001).  

TC, TIC, $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3},$ TOC, TN, and sulfur were determined on three discrete sediment samples. TI C content ranges from $1.1\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ at 2.95 mbsf to $0.02\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ at 18 mbsf. $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ values range from 0.2 t o $11.3\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . TOC ranges from 0.21 to $0.03\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . All TOC/TN ratios are below 5, indicating marin e organic matter. H and S were below detection limits.  

# 5.2.3.5. Physical properties  

Physical properties were measured on all whole-round cores, archive and working-half sections, and discrete samples from Hole U1566A. Measurements included GRA bulk density, MS, NGR, $P$ - wave velocity, X-ray imaging, MAD and porosity $(n=102)$ ) analysis, and thermal conductivity ( $\boxed{n=}$ 30).  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I cores have $P$ -wave velocities of 1489 to $2909\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ and whole-round GR A bulk density from 1.51 to $2.10~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and whole-round MS has a mean value of $77.7\,\times\,10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}$ compared to a mean of $86.9\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ from discrete half-round measurements. NGR values for th e sediments vary from 19 to 44 counts/s. The bulk density of discrete samples ranges from 1.54 t o $1.82\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ${\mathrm{(n}}=6)$ ), and grain densities range from 2.74 to $2.80\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

The ${\sim}121\mathrm{~m~}$ thick Unit II succession revealed dominantly very low gamma radiation counts ( $_{<10}$ counts/s) in the basalt subunits, whereas the intervolcanic sediment subunits show more variatio n and values up to 62.8 counts/s. Discrete samples have bulk densities ranging from 1.69 to 2.8 4 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ . Discrete measurements of $P$ -wave velocity range from 1530 to $5884~\mathrm{m/s}$ and display systematic variations associated with the varying lithologies. In total, 23 successful thermal conductivity measurements were made across a range of lithologies in Unit II with values ranging from  1 to $1.9\:\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ . The MS values in the sequence $\mathrm{(mean=482\;SI)}$ ) are significantly higher than thos e of the overlying soft sediments (mean $=78\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}_{.}$ ).  

The granitic basement in Unit III has higher gamma radiation readings (mean 53.5 counts/s) compared to the overlying volcanic sequence, and discrete bulk densities range from 1.97 to 2.5 8 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ . SHMG $P$ -wave velocity measurements range from 1502 to $4501\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , and thermal conductivity measurements have a mean value of $2.1\:\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\mathrm{{\cdotK}})$ .  

# 5.2.3.6. Downhole measurements  

Wireline data from the four log runs comprise sonic velocities, MS, NGR, bulk density, resistivit y measurements, and UBI and FMS image data of the basalt-sediment sequence of Lithostratigraphic Unit II. The lava package displays a consistently low background gamma radiation trend, with three clear peaks in the NGR log linked to siliciclastic sediment interlayers. The $\mathrm{MS~log}$ reveals clear variations, with the basaltic Lava Flows with higher susceptibility values in the basal t flow subunits and almost zero MS of the interbasalt sediments. The porosity-dependent resistivity, bulk density, photoelectric factor, and $P$ -wave and $S{\mathrm{.}}$ -wave velocity logs show systematic variations throughout basalt subunits similar to logs collected in other subaerial basalt flow sequence s in the province (e.g. Planke, 1994). For instance, the $P_{-}$ -wave velocity is as low as $2.5\;\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ in th e interbasalt sediments subunits and flow tops and increases toward the massive basalt interiors, reaching values up to almost $6\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ . The imaging logs (FMS-sonic and UBI) similarly display systematic variations in Lava Flow facies, with vesicular low-resistivity flow tops and massive resistiv e interiors with potential amygdales.  

# 5.3. Sites U1567 and U1568  

Sites U1567 and U1568 comprise a transect of five holes that sample the upper part of the Modgunn hydrothermal vent complex. The vent complex is truncated by an erosional unconformity o f early Eocene age and overlain by $20{-}50\ \mathrm{m}$ of Eocene to recent sediments. It consists of a feede r system and a crater at the paleoseafloor. The crater was rapidly infilled during the PETM, presenting an expanded section that consists of diatom-bearing mudstones and ash layers.  

# 5.3.1. Background and objectives  

A key objective of Expedition 396 was to constrain the role of breakup volcanism in the PETM. I t has for a long time been argued that LIPs may have a dramatic impact on the Earth's environmen t (e.g., Eldholm and Thomas, 1993; Svensen et al., 2019) and likely caused mass extinctions (e.g., Ernst and Youbi, 2017). Explosive volcanism influences the climate by the eruption of large volumes of aerosols and ash into the stratosphere, affecting the climate over short time periods o f days to years. Long-term climate effects of volcanism are mainly related to emission of sulfur dioxide, which may cause global cooling, and greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which cause s global warming.  

Very large volumes of greenhouse gases must be emitted in short time periods to trigger globa l warming. One potential mechanism for the eruption of several thousands of gigatons of carbonbearing gases is the maturation of sedimentary rocks by igneous intrusions offshore mid-Norwa y (Svensen et al. 2004). The key aspects of this hypothesis are that (1) magma injected as sill intrusions into organic-rich sedimentary rocks generates large volumes of greenhouse gases, namel y methane and carbon dioxide, in metamorphic aureoles around the sills, and (2) pressure buildu p due to gas generation causes fracturing of the host rocks, forming hydrothermal vent complexe s where the gas and associated solids are transported from the deep sediment basins to the hydrosphere and atmosphere.  

Although this process may release the amount of carbon required for the observed climate change, specifically between 2000 and 12000 Gt (Dickens et al., 1995; Dickens, 2011), it is not immediatel y clear if the bulk of the intrusions were emplaced over the geologically short time span that i s required to, for example, explain the observed spike in global warming during the PETM. Also, i t is unclear in which form the carbon would have been emitted, namely as $C O_{2}$ or $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ .  

The hydrothermal systems associated with sill intrusions are manifested as pipe-like seismi c anomalies that typically root at the tips of saucer-shaped sill intrusions (Planke et al., 2005). Thes e so-called hydrothermal vent complexes are divided into a lower part (the pipe) and an upper par t characterized by crater, eye, or dome-shaped seismic features at the paleoseafloor. The pipes ar e hundreds of meters high, sometimes up to $6\;\mathrm{km}$ . The upper part is typically $1{-}2\;\mathrm{km}$ in diamete r but may vary in size from some hundreds of meters to $>\!5\,\mathrm{km}$ . Many of the crater-shaped depressions are infilled by stratified seismic units and topped by characteristic mounds above the paleoseafloor. More than 1000 of these hydrothermal vent complexes have been mapped in sedimentar y basins along the northeast Atlantic margins (Skogseid and Eldholm, 1989; Planke et al., 2005; Manton, 2015; Reynolds et al., 2017; Kjoberg et al., 2017; Omosanya et al., 2018; Roelofse et al., 2021).  

Information on the nature of the pipes exists from cuttings from a single well in the Vøring Basi n (6607/12-1; Svensen et al., 2003; Frieling et al., 2016) and from field analogs, such as in the Karo o Basin in South Africa (Jamtveit et al., 2004; Svensen et al., 2006) and the Tunguska Basin in Siberi a (Svensen et al., 2009, 2018). The nature of the mound structures, however, is largely unconstrained. Their interpretation reaches from mud volcano–like sediment deposition to buildup o f massive sulfide deposits that are formed at the hydrothermal vent sites by precipitation from ho t vent fluids (Berndt et al., 2016).  

Sites U1567 (proposed Site VMVM-31A) and U1568 (proposed Site VMVM-40B) are located o n the Modgunn Arch (Figure F14) some $50\;\mathrm{km}$ north of the basalt flows sampled at the Kolga Hig h on a dome structure that is interpreted to have formed in the Miocene (Gernigon et al., 2021). Th e sites were selected because the regional doming uplifted the vent sites to within reach of IOD P drilling. Such shallow burial depths of vent complexes are currently only identified in the Modgunn Arch area in the Vøring Basin and in the Danmarkshavn Basin on the northeast Greenlan d shelf.  

The seismic data clearly show the presence of sill intrusions at shallow depth, ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{km}$ below seafloor, on the Modgunn Arch. The sills are located in a deformed sedimentary unit with wea k reflections that terminate against an angular unconformity (Figure F5). A hydrothermal vent complex is interpreted above the upper termination of the sill. The unconformity truncates the dippin g reflections in the upper part of the hydrothermal vent complex. At the center of the depression, immediately above the pipe structure, the reflections bend upward, forming a mound. Thi s mound is overlain by draped and onlapping reflections up toward the seafloor.  

The aim of Sites U1567 and U1568 was to sample the upper part of the Modgunn hydrotherma l vent complex and a nearby reference site along a $500\;\mathrm{m}$ long transect, avoiding the dome-shape d central part of the structure, to characterize the geology of the vent complex.  

The first drilling objective was to constrain the processes that form the seafloor depressions an d the infill. At least four potential scenarios are conceivable for this. First, pipe initiation may b e explosive due to interaction of sill intrusions with pre-existing zones of overpressure that may lea d to hydrofracturing of the host rock and rapid ascent of expanding gas. This will result in blowout s that can create craters with similar dimensions as the observed eye structure within days (Thatj e et al., 1999; Leifer and Judd, 2015) and infill within a few hundred years. Second, they may b e caused by long-term seepage of gas and aqueous fluids liquefying the surface sediments such a s Lusi mud volcano in Indonesia (Mazzini et al., 2007). Third, they may be caused by repeated mobilization of mud by sills intruding into unconsolidated sediments leading to mud volcanism (e.g., Perez-Garcia et al., 2009) over a time span of thousands of years. Finally, they may result fro m venting of hydrothermal fluids and precipitation of pyrites and pyrotites over thousands of year s (Berndt et al., 2016). Although the first two processes would require a later mobilization of th e infill to form the observed domes at the upper termination, for example by gas-controlled seafloo r doming (Koch et al., 2016), the domes in the latter two scenarios would be explained by the ejection of vent material.  

Each of the four processes would be associated with very different types of material that wa s ejected during the time that the pipe was formed, both for the solid and the fluid phase. Therefore, understanding the formative processes for the eye structures is intrinsically linked to the secon d objective: to obtain information on the fluid composition and gas concentration (i.e., $\mathrm{CO}_{2},\mathrm{CH}_{4},$ o r higher hydrocarbons) and the amount of carbon release because this is crucial for understandin g the potential role of hydrothermal venting as a driver of PETM climate change. This includes constraining the rates of fluid venting and its potential to reach far up into the water column and/o r atmosphere depending on how violent the release was, if submarine venting occurred.  

The third objective was to characterize the emplacement environment and age of the hydrothermal vent complexes and how it changed in response to venting and rapid warming during th e PETM. This characterization includes the changes in microfossil assemblages before, during, an d after the PETM. We also set out to determine whether there is evidence for environmenta l changes in the immediate vicinity of the proposed source of greenhouse gases.  

The fourth objective of Sites U1567 and U1568 was to date the prominent unconformity at th e Modgunn Arch and the timing of uplift of the eye structure because this constrains the vertica l movement of the margin which is crucial input for melt generation models.  

# 5.3.2. Operations  

Operations at Site U1567 revolved around three holes. The first hole reached 195.9 mbsf. Thre e coring systems were used. The APC system was used from the seafloor to 52.9 mbsf. The halflength APC (HLAPC) was deployed for a single core between 52.9 and 54.1 mbsf. After reachin g piston coring refusal, the XCB system was deployed for the remainder of the hole. Half-lengt h advances of the XCB system were employed to $69.4\,\mathrm{mbsf},$ and the remainder of the hole was core d using full-length advances. After coring operations ended in Hole U1567A, the hole was prepare d for wireline logging and then successfully logged with the triple combo and FMS-sonic too l strings.  

Hole U1567B was offset ${\sim}165\;\mathrm{m}$ west of Hole U1567A in the direction of Site U1568. It was drille d without recovery to 25 mbsf and then cored with the APC system to 49.3 mbsf, where we experienced a partial stroke of the APC system on Core 396-U1567B-4H. We then switched to the XC B system and continued coring with half-length advances to maximize core recovery. Hole U1567 B was terminated at 83 mbsf after retrieving Core 11X. After coring concluded, the drill string wa s pulled back above the seafloor and secured for transit under dynamic positioning (DP) mode t o Site U1568. The bit cleared the seafloor at $1850\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 August 2021, ending Hole U1567B.  

The $0.25\ \mathrm{nmi}$ move to Site U1568 was completed at $1936\,\mathrm{h}$ . With the thrusters already down, th e move from Site U1567 to Site U1568 consumed only $45~\mathrm{min}$ of vessel operations. Operations a t Site U1568 consisted of two holes. Hole U1568A reached 200.0 mbsf. Two coring systems wer e used in the coring operations. The APC system was used from the seafloor to 51.7 mbsf. The fina l two cores, 396-U1568A-6H and 7H, were both incomplete strokes, and Core 7H advanced onl y $0.3\;\mathrm{m}$ into the formation. The XCB system was employed to advance the hole to the final depth o f 200 mbsf. The hole was then prepared for logging, and we successfully conducted two passes wit h each the triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings. With operations in Hole U1568A complete, th e vessel was offset along the seismic line by approximately $165\;\mathrm{m}$ in the direction of Site U1567.  

Hole U1568B was washed down to 30 mbsf. The APC system was deployed and advanced to 49. 0 mbsf, where we experienced a partial stroke of the APC system on Core 396-U1568B-3H. Th e XCB system was deployed, and coring continued with half-length advances to maximize cor e recovery to 114.8 mbsf. Hole U1568B was terminated at 124.6 mbsf after retrieving Core 17X wit h a full-length advance. After coring concluded, the drill string was pulled back above the seafloo r and secured for the DP transit back to Site U1567, thus ending Hole U1568B at $1900~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 6 August. After completing operations at Site U1568 and with the APC/XCB drill string stil l deployed, the vessel moved in DP mode to reoccupy Site U1567. A total of $71.50~\mathrm{h}$ or 3.0 day s elapsed while conducting operations at Site U1568.  

A total of 43 cores were recovered at Site U1568. The APC system was deployed nine times over  a $70.7\:\mathrm{m}$ interval and recovered $72.03\:\mathrm{m}$ of core $(102\%)$ . A total of 34 XCB cores were recovered ove r a $223.9\;\mathrm{m}$ interval. The XCB system recovered $75\%$ of the interval cored or $167.34\;\mathrm{m}$ of core. Th e total interval cored at Site U1568 was $294.6~\mathrm{m};~239.37~\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered for an overall coring efficiency of $81\%$ .  

After completing coring operations at Site U1568, we set the end of the pipe at 1666 meters belo w rig floor (mbrf) and returned to Site U1567 in DP mode to core an additional hole between Hole s U1567A and U1567B with the objective of improving the sampling across the Paleocene/Eocen e boundary at this site. Once over the new hole coordinates, we spudded Hole U1567C at $2040\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 26 August. The precision depth recorder seafloor depth was 1706.1 mbsl. We drilled to 30 mbs f without recovery and then APC/XCB cored to 106.0 mbsf (Cores 396-U1567C-1H through 14X). Coring operations were completed at $0820\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 August, and the drill string was recovered bac k on board and secured for the sea passage to Site U1569. A total of $72.25\,\mathrm{h}$ or 3.0 days passed whil e conducting operations at Site U1567. A total of 46 cores were taken at this site. The total interva l cored at Site U1567 was $329.9\;\mathrm{m}$ with $303.35\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered $(92\%)$ .  

# 5.3.3. Principal results  

# 5.3.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Sites U1567 and U1568 are described together and consist of five holes spread along a $500\;\mathrm{m}$ transect of infilled sediments associated with cratering in the Modgunn hydrothermal vent complex. The succession recovered at the two sites is divided into six lithostratigraphic units, all of whic h are identified in each of the five holes and are preliminarily tied based on unit boundaries. Generally, core recovery was high in all the holes and the depths of most lithostratigraphic unit boundaries are well established. Unit I is gray clay with trace to rare dropstones. Unit II consists of dar k brownish gray sediment (clay- to pebble-sized nodules) rich in manganese and iron in the uppermost interval and light yellowish brown sand-rich clay throughout. Unit III is pale yellow to ver y dark greenish gray clay with silt, including clasts of clay and rare beds of siltstone. Unit IV is dar k greenish gray to very dark gray claystone to siltstone with common volcanic ash beds. Unit V i s very dark gray to black parallel laminated claystone with common volcanic ash and lacking bioturbation. Unit VI is very dark greenish gray clay- to siltstone with moderate bioturbation.  

# 5.3.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

The five holes cored at Sites U1567 and U1568 penetrated strata of predominantly early Paleogen e age. A thin layer of Quaternary sediments was present in all holes in roughly equal thicknes s $\left(\sim\!35\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ and was assigned a Quaternary age based on planktonic foraminifer content. No Neogen e sediments were identified. Below this, mid-early Eocene (Zone E3) sediments were sampled i n Holes U1567A, U1567B, and U1568A. Biostratigraphic and palynological analyses indicate d earliest Eocene sediments (Zone E1) were recorded in Hole U1568A, but their presence was no t confirmed by biostratigraphic analyses in Hole U1568B and Holes U1567A–U1567C. The PET M succession below is identified based on the presence of the dinocyst marker species Apectodiniu m augustum (P6b) and supported by diatom marker taxa (Figure F9). The extremely expande d PETM deposits sit below the early or earliest Eocene sediments and span between ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{m}$ in Hol e U1567A and a virtually unprecedented $70{-}80\ \mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1568A, given the combined biostratigraphic and lithostratigraphic constraints.  

Hole U1567B, and perhaps Hole U1568B, may contain a latest Paleocene sequence (Zone P6a), bu t this is not seen in any of the other holes, where the PETM succession rests unconformably on earl y late to middle Paleocene sedimentary successions.  

# 5.3.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

The sediments at Sites U1567 and U1568 show low magnetic intensity (less than ${\sim}10^{-3}\;\mathrm{A/m})$ i n ${\sim}40\%$ of the recovered sections. In some intervals, both the magnetic intensity and the magneti c inclination angle vary greatly. The consistent distribution of these intervals with depth and acros s holes suggests that the low intensity is determined by the detrital source rather than representin g a drilling artifact. In such intervals, magnetic polarity cannot be reliably determined. The magnetic inclination data after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization is typically used to determine magneti c polarity and to place the core sections in a magnetostratigraphic age framework. On the othe r hand, there are also intervals with moderate to high magnetic intensity (greater than ${\sim}10^{-3}\,\mathrm{A/m})$ ) . These present both magnetic reversals and magnetic excursions, particularly in Holes U1567 A (Core 4H), U1567B (Core 2H), and U1568A (Sections 4H-3 through 5H-3). These reversals, having similar inclination angles in normal and reverse polarity, pass the polarity test and therefor e are interpreted as recording the geomagnetic field. The uppermost cores of each hole show a dominantly normal polarity and an inclination close to the calculated geomagnetic dipole field inclination $(\sim\!77^{\circ})$ for these latitudes. These characteristics suggest that the paleomagnetic data of th e youngest sediments accurately capture the geomagnetic field and its periodic reversals.  

# 5.3.3.4. Geochemistry  

Almost 100 fluid and sediment samples were collected from the five holes along the transec t between Holes U1567A and U1568A. For Hole U1568A, the site closest to the center of the Modgunn vent complex, several elemental profiles of IW diverge from the conservative behavio r observed in most of the other holes. The first evidence for this can be seen in the transitio n between Lithostratigraphic Units I and II (36 mbsf), where some elements decrease significantl y across the boundary. These include K (from 12 to $11\,\mathrm{mM}$ ) and $\mathrm{Mg}$ (from ${>}50$ to ${<}45\;\mathrm{mM}$ ). Some o f the analyzed elements increase in concentration across this boundary, with the clearest rise s observable in the profiles of $C\mathbf{a}$ (from ${>}12$ to $13.5\;\mathrm{mM}]$ ), Sr (from 80 to $110\;\mathrm{mM}_{}$ ), and Li (from 3 0 to $40\;\mathrm{mM}$ ). These shifts suggest a complex diagenetic environment, with evidence of marine silicate weathering (e.g., increasing Na and K) but also ash alteration (e.g., rising Ca and decreasin g $\mathrm{Mg})$ . The elemental data for Unit IV in Hole U1568A corroborate the anomalous values of alkalinity and $\mathsf{p H}$ in these strata. Contents of B, Ca, Mg, Si, Sr, and Li are all diminished with respect t o overlying and underlying sediments. Mn, Fe, and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ covary in Hole U1568A, displaying clea r enrichments in the uppermost section of the hole and much lower values below 50 mbsf. Increased concentrations of these constituents in the upper sections lend support for microbiall y mediated oxidation of organic matter.  

# 5.3.3.5. Physical properties  

Physical properties were measured for all cores from the five holes at Sites U1567 and U1568. Lithostratigraphic Unit I consists of up to $35\;\mathrm{m}$ thick Quaternary glacial and interglacial deposit s with a mean bulk density of $1.81~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and porosities between $47\%$ and $67\%$ . The unit shows  a relatively high gamma radioactivity with an across-borehole median value of 40 counts/s. $P$ -wav e velocities measured by the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) range from 1480 to 297 8 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ with a median of $1572\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , and SHMG $P.$ -wave point measurements never exceed $1702\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s},$ , attesting to the soft and poorly compacted nature of the sediments. Unit II is generally less than  2 m thick and consists of Quaternary clay characterized by a rapid decrease in velocity and densit y with respect to Unit I. The underlying mid-early Eocene Unit III is characterized by a gradua l increase in density (mean value $=1.71\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ ) with a corresponding increase in MS that increase s most substantially toward the base of the unit, reaching maximum values in all five holes. Th e peak MS transition associated with the Unit III/IV boundary generally decreases laterally fro m Hole U1568A (maximum $=1772\times10^{-5}$ SI; mean $=451.3\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI})$ ) to Hole U1567A (maximum $=$ $740.5\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ ; mean $=225.3\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI},$ ). The highest MS values above this horizon $(>\!1700\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ as measured by the Section Half Multisensor Logger [SHMSL]) occur in the two holes most proximal to the center of the vent complex (U1568A and U1568B). We suggest that the basal high M S layer (with values greater than $1700\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}_{.}$ ) in the two proximal boreholes may pinch out prio r to reaching the three more distal Site U1567 boreholes, where values $\sim\!700{-}800\,\times\,10^{-5}\,\,\mathrm{SI}$ ar e recorded.  

The recovered thickness of Unit IV varies from $\mathord{\sim}6\;\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1567A to more than $65\;\mathrm{m}$ in Hol e U1568A. The recorded $P$ -wave velocity $\mathrm{(mean\,=\,1922~m/s;}$ median $=1903\ \mathrm{m/s}$ ) is the highes t amongst all units, associated with a relatively high mean bulk density of $1.74\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and a relativel y low MS of $90\times10^{-5}$ SI. The general trend of decreasing MS with depth appears to be linked to  a reduction of ash layers with depth in Unit IV. Units $\mathrm{V}$ and VI reveal generally low and consistent $P.$ - wave velocities of around $1600\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ with accompanying low bulk densities with a mean of 1.43 an d $1.42~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively. In summary, the cored sequences revealed physical properties that ar e consistent with a very weakly compacted mudstone-dominated sequence with fine-scale interna l physical property variations linked to ash deposition.  

# 5.3.3.6. Downhole measurements  

Logging data were collected over a total open hole interval of ${\sim}112\,\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1567A and ${\sim}105\;\mathrm{m}$ in U1568A, yielding high-quality data from both the modified triple combo and FMS-sonic too l strings. Four logging units for Hole U1567A and three for Hole U1568A were defined; they broadly correspond to the lithostratigraphic units. Velocities and densities are low with few anomalies in the reference hole, U1567A, around $1.55~\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ and $1.45~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively. However,  a well-defined NGR peak of $65~\mathrm{gAPI}$ is clearly visible. The proximal vent hole, U1568A, shows  a large variation of seismic and NGR properties, with a velocity range of 1.5 to $2.7~\mathrm{km/s}$ , densitie s from 1.55 to $1.9~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and NGR from 30 to 40 gAPI. Logging Unit 3 in Hole U1568A has a n anomalously high photoelectric factor (indicating high average atomic number) at the top, whic h may indicate the presence of heavy elements such as Ba. FMS image log data from both hole s nicely show fine-scale sedimentary structures and stratification.  

# 5.4. Sites U1569 and U1570  

Sites U1569 and U1570 were drilled as a transect of five holes on the Mimir High, which is part o f the Vøring transform margin. We recovered an expanded section of Paleocene and Eocene sediments including a thick interval of PETM deposits in three holes. The cores will allow us to constrain the climatic and environmental changes at high resolution and provide constraints on th e biogeochemical changes influenced by hydrothermal venting. The expanded sedimentary section s show that the Vøring transform margin was a depocenter during Paleocene rifting and into th e early Eocene until the marginal high formed during passage of the Aegir Ridge some 5 My afte r breakup.

Site U1569 (proposed Site VMVM-55B) and the ribbon of four boreholes that comprise Sit e U1570 (proposed Site VMVM-56A) are located on the Mimir High at a 2171 to $2270\ \mathrm{m}$ wate r depth. The Mimir High is a transform margin high on the Vøring transform margin (Figure F14). Such highs are characteristic structural elements of transform margins world wide, such as offshore Ghana/Côte d’Ivoire, western Australia, and the Falklands (Basile and Allemand, 2002; Mercier de Lépinay et al., 2016; Baby et al., 2018; Lorenzo and Wessel, 1997). Transform margins ar e characterized by very narrow COBs and late uplift of the continental crust when the adjacen t spreading center passes. Several processes are involved in the formation of the highs. They includ e lateral heat transport and associated thermal uplift as well as erosion-enhanced uplift (Vågnes, 1997; Basile and Allemand, 2002).  

The Vøring transform margin is characterized by diminished breakup-related extrusive volcanis m compared to the juxtaposed rifted margin segments of the Vøring and Møre Margins (Berndt e t al., 2001a). Nevertheless, thin extrusive basalts, intrusions, and a high-velocity lower crustal bod y have been documented for the Vøring transform Margin (Gernigon et al., 2021; Mjelde et al., 2009). The reduced magmatic crustal thickening may be the result of lateral heat transport fro m the rifted Møre Margin into the continental Vøring Basin to the north lowering the ambient mantle temperature and resulting in reduced melt supply (Berndt et al., 2001b). As a result, the basal t cover on the Vøring transform margin is generally thin and even absent on the Mimir High (Figur e F14). However, an erosional truncation at the top of the high does not preclude that some basal t have originally existed and were subsequently eroded.

The absence of a basalt cover makes the Mimir High an exceptional place to study the stratigraph y at intervals coeval to and below the Paleogene basalt. These formations are not well known fro m drilling; the closest boreholes, 6504/5-15 and 6603/5-16, are more than $100\,\mathrm{km}$ away. However, th e strata are subcropping along a kilometer-high escarpment on the southwest flank of the Mimi r High. This escarpment was sampled during two cruises conducted in 2000 and 2013 using gravit y corers, dredges, and an ROV (Polteau et al., 2020). The cruises documented the presence of Uppe r Cretaceous to Lower Eocene successions that include outcropping doleritic sills with columna r jointing. Although the recovered late Campanian and early Maastrichtian sediments were deposited in a coastal to shallow marine setting, the Paleocene samples indicate deep marine condition s with abrupt shoaling and formation of the Mimir High in the early Eocene. Toward the Vørin g Basin, seismic data clearly show several large sill intrusions that affected this part of the margi n and indicate that the strata generally dips from the Mimir High to the northeast (Figure F6).  

The first objective of Sites U1569 and U1570 was to constrain the paleoenvironmental condition s during the Paleocene–Eocene transition. In particular, we hoped to obtain high-resolution information about the timing, duration, and nature of the environmental changes due to rapid warmin g and subsequent cooling during the earliest Eocene.  

The second objective of Sites U1569 and U1570 was to tie the borehole stratigraphy with reflection seismic data to constrain the vertical movements of this margin segment as an input for geodynamic melt production models. In particular, the timing of uplift and any further constraints o n the amount of crustal stretching are important.  

The third objective of Sites U1569 and U1570 was to characterize the Paleogene sediments an d their potential for releasing hydrocarbons when intruded by sills. Here, the key parameter is th e amount of TOC in the sediments that may be transformed to greenhouse gases by contact metamorphosis.  

In the case that any igneous rocks were sampled, a further objective was to constrain the meltin g and emplacement conditions. This includes the composition of the magma and in particular th e temperatures at which melting took place.  

# 5.4.2. Operations  

The original plan for Site U1569 called for dual coring of key stratigraphic intervals, including  a hole to 300 mbsf to be cored using the APC/XCB system and a second hole to 800 mbsf to be core d using the RCB system. In the case we could not properly sample the complete stratigraphic targe t at Site U1569, four offset holes of $200\,\mathrm{m}$ each were proposed along a transect of outcropping strat a extending west of Site U1569, where deep stratigraphic targets were present at shallower subseafloor depths, as an alternative drilling strategy.  

Hole U1569A was cored to the shortened depth of 404.6 mbsf after coring through the PETM, ou r scientific target, and penetrating $50\textrm{m}$ into the late Paleocene. Estimating that the base of th e Paleocene could be much deeper and to improve core recovery of the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, we ended coring in Hole U1569A in favor of sampling the older strata at much shallowe r depths at proposed alternate ribbon Site U1570. Coring the PETM strata at a shallower locatio n also allowed us to sample less mature PETM sediments with better microfossil preservation.  

After coring ended in Hole U1569A, we conditioned the hole and released the RCB bit at the bottom of Hole U1569A in preparation for wireline logging. The hole was then displaced with 125 bbl of 10.5 ppg mud, and the end of the pipe was set at 84.0 mbsf. The triple combo tool string wa s rigged up and deployed to log Hole U1569A. The initial logging run failed to pass a bridge at 127. 4 mbsf. With very little open hole to log, the tools were pulled back to the surface and logging operations were terminated. After logging concluded, the drill string was pulled back to the surface. The remaining top half of the mechanical bit release (MBR) cleared the rotary table at $2220\ \mathrm{h}_{:}$ , ending Hole U1569A and Site U1569. A total of $74.25~\mathrm{h}$ or 3.1 days were recorded while on Sit e U1569.  

A total of $44\,\mathrm{RCB}$ cores were retrieved from the site, five of which were half-length advances. Th e RCB system cored $404.6~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $144.91\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(36\%)$ . The coring plan at Site U157 0 was the same for all four holes: to core to 200 mbsf and sample the Paleocene/Eocene boundar y interval at considerably shallower depths than at Site U1569. Three of the four holes were completed to $200\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , and the fourth one was terminated at 163.6 mbsf after we determined that th e science objective for the hole had been met. All four holes were cored with the RCB coring syste m with a combination of half-length $(4.6\,\textrm{m})$ and full-length $_{(9.6\,\textrm{m})}$ advances. The half-lengt h advances were used to maximize core recovery in zones of interest at the expense of the additiona l wireline time. Coring in the final hole, U1570D, was ended after reaching the Environmental Protection and Safety Panel approved depth of $200\;\mathrm{mbsf}.$ . After conditioning Hole U1570D for wireline logging, the RCB bit was released at the bottom of the hole and the end of pipe was set at 76. 0 mbsf. The triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings were successfully deployed to the full depth o f the hole. After logging concluded, the drill string was pulled back to the surface. The bottom-hol e assembly (BHA) was racked back in the derrick, and the outer core barrel was disassembled an d inspected. The rig floor was secured at $2348\;\mathrm{h}_{:}$ , and the bridge was notified that operations wer e complete at Site U1570. A total of $112\ \mathrm{RCB}$ cores were taken at the site. The RCB system core d $763.6~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $270.09\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(35.4\%)$ . A total of $147.50~\mathrm{h}$ or 6.2 days were recorde d while on Site U1570.  

# 5.4.3. Principal results  

# 5.4.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Sites U1569 and U1570 consist of five holes on the northeastern flank of the Mimir High, a transform margin high. The holes sampled northeast dipping stratigraphy along a $5\,\mathrm{km}$ transect wher e Paleogene-age seismic reflections truncate below thin Quaternary sediments at ribbon Sit e U1570. The succession recovered at the two sites is divided into ten lithostratigraphic units. A s expected from the seismic interpretation of the high-resolution 3-D seismic data, none of the fiv e holes include all ten units. Unit boundaries are identified based on lithologic change and supported by physical properties and biostratigraphy. Where recovery is high, boundaries betwee n units are well established. Where core recovery is low, unit boundaries are placed at the top of th e underlying unit.  

• Unit I is grayish brown and brown unconsolidated mud.   
• Unit II consists of dark greenish gray consolidated mud which is locally slightly bioturbated.   
• Unit III is grayish brown sand rich clay with nodules.   
• Unit IV is very dark gray mudstone.   
• Unit V is divided into two subunits. Subunit Va is very dark gray mudstone with sparse parallel lamination and slight localized bioturbation along with rare limestone intervals and common ash beds. Subunit Vb is very dark gray mudstone with sparse parallel lamination and slight localized bioturbation along with common ash beds and diagenetic pyrite.   
• Unit VI is hypohyaline garnet dacite with cordierite, pyrite, and graphite.   
• Unit VII is dark gray ash-rich mudstone with parallel lamination and common pyrite.   
• Unit VIII is dark greenish gray to dark gray bioturbated mudstone.   
• Unit IX is light gray limestone.   
• Unit X is very dark greenish gray bioturbated mudstone with common ash along with some beds of limestone and volcaniclastic conglomerate.  

# 5.4.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

Quaternary sediments from Holes U1569A and U1570A–U1570D ${\sqrt{\sqrt{\frac{}{}-10-80\mathrm{~m~}}}}$ thick) are characterized by glacially influenced hemipelagic mud, which unconformably overlies lower to middl e Miocene strata followed by uppermost Oligocene and lower Eocene strata. The lower Eocen e deposits are thick $\left(>\!100\mathrm{~m}\right)$ , and much of the lower Eocene is apparently missing. The Eocen e deposits include a thick PETM succession that is at least $10{-}40\mathrm{~m~}$ thick. The sequences fro m U1569A and U1570D, spanning the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, do not show any record of th e presence of uppermost Paleocene sediments. Dinocyst chronobiostratigraphy suggests that a t least $^{\sim1}$ My of the latest Paleocene is missing. The oldest sediments recovered are assigned to th e middle Paleocene (Selandian; $61.6{-}59.2\,\mathrm{~Ma})$ ), recorded in samples from Holes U1569A an d U1570C.  

# 5.4.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

For the post-PETM strata (Lithostratigraphic Unit I, Subunits IIa and IIb, Units III and IV, Subunits Va and Vb, and Units $\mathrm{V}$ and VI), the average intensity of magnetization varies from $2.26~\times$ $10^{-2}$ to $3.22\times10^{-2}\;\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ . The median coercivity varies from 1.06 to 2.17, indicating the magneti c mineralogy is dominated by diagenetic hematite or goethite. There are six conspicuous episodes o f magnetic reversals marked by magnetic inclinations $<\,0^{\circ}$ . The bulk MS of one discrete sampl e (396-U1569A-23R, $28\mathrm{-}30\ \mathrm{m})$ is over $1\,\times\,10^{-3}$ SI, indicating a small ferromagnetic contribution, possibly from magnetite. This is also the only discrete sample presenting subhorizontal magneti c fabrics. The rest of the samples are paramagnetic, with a bulk MS below $1\,\times\,10^{-3}$ SI, and hav e oblique magnetic fabrics, which may be owed to drilling-related disturbances. A low correcte d degree of anisotropy $(\mathrm{{Pj}<1.028})$ indicates the absence of micaceous minerals.  

The average intensity of magnetization of PETM strata (Unit VIII) is lower than the post-PET M strata $\langle0.06\times10^{-2}$ to $0.13\times10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A/m})$ . However, the median coercivity is higher (1.32–3.04), indicating higher hematite or goethite proportions. At least two short-lived episodes of normal polarity truncated the dominantly reverse magnetic polarity. All four discrete samples present obliqu e magnetic fabrics, low bulk MS $\mathrm{{^{\smallKm}\leq0.4\times10^{-3}\;S I}})$ and low corrected degree of anisotropy $(\mathrm{{Pj}\leq}$ 1.018). Pre-PETM strata (Units VIII–X) have the highest coercivity (2.77–4.41) compared to th e post-PETM and PETM units. High coercivity may be due to higher proportions of hematite an d goethite. Their intensity of magnetization $\langle0.06\,\times\,10^{-2}$ to $0.59\,\times\,10^{-2}\,\,\mathrm{A/m})$ is lower than postPETM strata but similar to PETM strata. All discrete samples have low bulk MS $\mathrm{{Km}}\le0.5\times10^{-3},$ ) and a low corrected degree of magnetic anisotropy $\mathrm{(Pj\leq1.077)}$ ). Only two discrete samples (396- U1570B-21R, $56{-}58~\mathrm{cm}$ , and 25R, $92{-}94~\mathrm{cm}]$ ) present subhorizontal magnetic fabrics. The res t have oblique fabrics, possibly due to drilling-related disturbances.  

# 5.4.3.4. Geochemistry  

Geochemical data from the two Mimir High sites show substantial variability both downcore an d between holes. In Hole U1569A, nonconservative behavior is observed for a range of measure d IW variables, with periods of high pH and low alkalinity similar to those observed at Sites U156 7 and U1568. This is also similar to the profiles observed in Hole U1570C and suggests lithologi c changes control the IW composition. In Holes U1570A and U1570B, however, elemental distributions appear to be primarily conservative, and they suggest diffusion and advection are the primary controls on IW composition, potentially linked to the extensive fracturing of these rocks. I n all holes, carbonate content is high in the upper units before dropping to lower values farthe r downcore. Occasional peaks in carbonate and organic carbon content suggest infrequent authigenic mineral precipitation. Lithostratigraphic Unit IV in Hole U1570D was investigated via ICPAES, appears to be dacitic, and may represent shallow emplacement into the sediment package . XRD analysis indicates the primary sedimentary components are quartz, calcite, and a range o f clays. In some samples, it was possible to identify clinoptilite as the primary clay mineral, a form o f zeolite linked to ash weathering. The direct impact of volcanic ash deposition is present in th e form of a range of pyroxene minerals.  

# 5.4.3.5. Physical properties  

A total of 151 samples across the five holes cored at Sites U1569 and U1570 were measured fo r MAD, and 1344 $P$ -wave velocity measurements were made on discrete samples to constrain an d supplement physical property measurements conducted on the WRMSL and SHMSL. The result s showed distinct petrophysical properties for the 10 lithostratigraphic units that were described a t the sites. Similarly to Sites U1567 and U1568, peaks in MS are related to the presence of ash beds, such as in Lithostratigraphic Subunit Va. However, the magnetic signature of ash beds dissipates i n Subunit Vb, and this characteristic is interpreted as evidence of increased alteration of the ashes. The dacitic Unit VI, which was sampled in Holes U1570A and U1570D, has noticeably high seismic velocity, relatively high density, and low MS. However, the highest $P$ -wave velocity of all fiv e holes is recorded in Unit IX $\mathrm{(mean=4172.6\;m/s)}$ ), which represents the thin limestone bed foun d in Hole U1570B. This unit also has high density (GRA bulk density mean $=2.31\ \mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ ) and th e lowest porosity (MAD porosity $=19\%$ ) values.  

# 5.4.3.6. Downhole measurements  

Wireline logging was conducted in Holes U1569A and U1570D, which extended to $404.6~\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth below seafloor (DSF) and $200\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, respectively. Two wireline logging tool strings, th e triple combo and the FMS-sonic, were planned for Hole U1569A; however, an obstructio n encountered at $127.4\mathrm{~m~}$ wireline log depth below seafloor (WSF) during the first deployment o f the triple combo prevented us from completing the logging plan. In contrast, two logging run s were performed successfully in Hole U1570D with the triple combo and the FMS-sonic too l strings over a total open hole logged interval of ${\sim}117\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Six logging units were defined in Hole U1570D, constrained by a combination of the lithostratigraphy, physical properties, and wireline data. In the main open hole logged interval of Hol e U1570D, the wireline properties reveal several transitions that correspond closely to the lithostratigraphic units.  

Logging Unit 1 corresponds to an interval of the hole logged behind the pipe. It is best defined b y slightly higher gamma radiation readings $({\sim}10~\mathrm{gAPI})$ from the seafloor to ${\sim}22\mathrm{~m~}$ wireline lo g matched depth below seafloor (WMSF) compared to the gamma radiation of the underlying Logging Unit 2 $(\sim\!4\ \mathrm{gAPI})$ . This change corresponds well to the measured whole-round NGR value s for the poorly recovered sediments in Lithostratigraphic Units I and II. The open hole part of Logging Unit 2 reveals gamma radiation of ${\sim}45{-}50\ \mathrm{gAPI}$ , low bulk density of ${\sim}1.6{-}1.7\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and lo w consistent $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ of around ${\sim}1.65\,\mathrm{km/s}$ . Logging Unit 3 exhibits relatively high $V_{\mathrm{p}}\left({\sim}1.8\mathrm{-}2.3\,\mathrm{km/s}\right)$ an d resistivity compared to its surrounding claystone-dominated sequence and corresponds closely t o Lithostratigraphic Unit VI. Logging Unit 4 is characterized by relatively high gamma radiation, fluctuating between ${\sim}45$ and $85~\mathrm{gAPI}$ . Logging Unit 5 comprises a thin ${\sim}3\textrm{m}$ thick interval wit h elevated density $(\sim\!1.95\,\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ and $V_{\mathrm{p}}\left(2\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}\right)$ and extreme photoelectric effect (PEF) enrichmen t up to ${\sim}33\,\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{e}^{-}$ coupled with a gamma radiation reduction. The remainder of the logged section i s assigned to Logging Unit 6 and shows minor fluctuations in gamma radiation, density, and PEF.  

# 5.5. Sites U1571 and U1572  

Sites U1571 and U1572 sampled the upper termination of the Inner SDRs on the central part of th e Vøring Margin. At both sites, two holes were drilled: the first using the RCB to sample the basalti c basement and the second one using the APC to sample the overlying sediment package. The reason for drilling two sites only $5~\mathrm{km}$ apart was the starkly different seismic character of the to p basalt surface that we interpreted to be the boundary between different emplacement environments, with the upper sequence being emplaced in a wet or an aquatic environment. The sediments are of late early Eocene age, which could be consistent with late emplacement of the las t flood basalts on the Vøring Marginal High. There is, however, a distinct possibility that the overlying sediments were not deposited immediately after the lava flows.  

# 5.5.1. Background and objectives  

Sites U1571 (proposed Site VMVM-61A) and U1572 (proposed Site VMVM-07A) are located o n the Skoll High on the Vøring Marginal High, about $15\,\mathrm{km}$ west of the Vøring Escarpment (Figur e F15). The western part of the Vøring Marginal High is characterized by SDR sequences, first note d by Hinz and Weber (1976), that have early been interpreted as up to $6\,\mathrm{km}$ thick volcanic complexe s near the COB (Skogseid and Eldholm, 1987, 1989). The first sampling of basalts on the Vørin g Marginal High was accomplished in 1974 during DSDP Leg 38 (Talwani, Udintsev, et al., 1976). Holes 338 and 342 were drilled into basement, and 11 and $12\;\mathrm{m}$ of basalt were recovered, respectively, in 6 cores. Subsequently, a $1277\;\mathrm{m}$ deep borehole was drilled into the upper termination o f the SDRs during ODP Leg 104 during the summer of 1985 (Eldholm et al., 1987). Hole 642 E yielded more than $900\;\mathrm{m}$ of basalt and penetrated at least 135 lava flows and 3 dikes. The flow s were interlayered with 59 volcaniclastic sedimentary units that mainly represent weathered basal t flow tops and one ignimbrite. Based on their geochemical and petrological composition, the volcanic succession was divided into an upper $800\;\mathrm{m}$ thick tholeiite series and a lower series that is a t least $100\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and consists of dominantly basaltic andesite flows (Eldholm et al., 1987; Abdelmalak et al., 2016).  

The extent and thickness of the breakup-related basaltic complex has subsequently been mappe d along the mid-Norwegian continental margin using the concepts of seismic volcanostratigraph y and igneous seismic geomorphology (Berndt et al., 2001b; Planke et al., 2000, 2017; Millett et al., 2020b). The seismic reflection data reveal substantial differences in the volcanic emplacemen t environments across the Vøring Marginal High in time and space. Planke et al. (2017) documente d distinct differences in the physical volcanology across the marginal high based on geomorphometric analysis of the top basalt surface. The eastern parts of the margin are characterized by a lav a flow field that suggests that lava was flowing from eruption centers in the west toward the paleocoastline in the east where they form a lava delta (Abdelmalak et al., 2016b). Incised valleys on th e top basalt surface further suggest erosion by rivers flowing from west to east. The top basalt surface farther west is characterized by a rough morphology with numerous semicircular anomalie s that have been interpreted as rootless cones due to lava flowing across a wet substrate leading t o phreatomagmatic eruptions. This pitted surface belongs to a seismic sequence that onlaps ont o the eastern flow field and must be younger than the subaerial basalts drilled in Hole 642E (Figur e F7A). Strikingly, the two domains also exhibit very different structural deformation. Althoug h there are only few normal faults with little displacement that offset the sequence with the pitte d surface, the eastern lava flows toward the escarpment are offset by numerous north–south trending normal faults with offsets of tens of meters.  

Site U1571 is located on the eastern, faulted lava flow field, whereas Site U1572 is located on th e pitted surface farther west. The morphological difference between the two sites and the onla p relationship suggest that the lavas have been emplaced diachronously, possibly in different environments. The first objective of these sites was to obtain information on the emplacement environment based on the facies of the recovered basalt and sediments. This information wil l constrain the vertical movements of the margin, for example, whether both facies were indee d emplaced in a subaerial environment or whether there is a difference between the relatively well constrained subaerial flows in the east and the possibly shallow marine flows in the west. The second objective was to establish the time of emplacement of the two sequences to constrain the temporal evolution of the breakup volcanism. The third objective was closely linked to the first two: b y analyzing the emplacement environment, we hoped to obtain information on the environmenta l and by proxy the climatic changes during and shortly after the main phase of volcanism. This wil l primarily be based on biostratigraphic and geochemical analysis of the sedimentary successio n immediately above the top of the basalt and possibly the sedimentary layers between basalt flows. The fourth objective was to constrain the conditions in the melt region, specifically the composition of the mantle before melting and the ambient temperature from the geochemistry and petrology of the encountered rocks. Reaching this objective will help to parameterize geodynami c models that will distinguish between the relative importance of the drivers of excess volcanism.

Furthermore, Sites U1571 and U1572 will address two auxiliary objectives laid out in the Scientifi c Prospectus. First, we hope to provide information on the suitability of the breakup basal t sequences and interbedded sediments for permanent geological storage of $C O_{2}$ . This will requir e obtaining information on their porosity and permeability as well as their geochemical composition, in particular the abundance of olivine, which may react with ${\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ . Second, we hope to obtai n information on the earliest incursion of deep water into the North Atlantic and the extent of majo r freshwater incursions into the young ocean (e.g., during the Azolla event) (Brinkhuis et al., 2006).  

Finally, and akin to the other sites, we will use the drilling results to test and calibrate the volcanological predictions of seismic volcanostratigraphy and igneous seismic geomorphology for th e Landward Flows and SDRs and smaller-scale volcanic elements identified in the seismic reflectio n data.  

# 5.5.2. Operations  

Site U1571 consisted of two holes. The first hole was cored using the RCB system from the seafloor to 247.6 mbsf and then logged with the triple combo, FMS-sonic, and UBI logging too l strings. Although the original plan called for a single hole to 240 mbsf, the poor recovery throug h a critical stratigraphic interval suggested an additional hole should be cored at the site. The AP C and XCB systems were selected for the second hole. Hole U1571B was cored with the APC syste m to refusal at 57.2 mbsf. The XCB coring system was deployed and cored with good results throug h 143.7 mbsf. Polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) XCB cutting shoes were used to core throug h the hard layers between 125 and 143.7 mbsf. Coring in Hole U1571B was terminated at $1005\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 11 September 2021. The drill string was pulled back to the surface after clearing the seafloor a t $1110\,\mathrm{h}$ . On clearing the seafloor, the vessel began moving in DP mode to the next site, which wa s located $3.1\ \mathrm{nmi}$ away. The APC/XCB coring bit cleared the rotary table at $1351\ \mathrm{h};$ , ending Hol e U1571B and Site U1571. A total of $124\,\mathrm{{h}}$ or 5.2 days were recorded while on Site U1571.  

A total of 59 cores were taken at the site. The RCB coring system was used for Hole U1571A. Th e RCB system cored $247.6~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $116.55\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(47.1\%)$ . Hole U1571B used both th e APC system and the XCB system. Seven APC cores were taken over a $57.2~\mathrm{m}$ interval. Recover y was 58.73 m $(102.7\%)$ . The XCB system was used for 13 cores over a $86.5\;\mathrm{m}$ interval and recovere d $62.2\%$ of the cored interval.  

Site U1572 also consisted of two holes. The first hole was cored using the RCB system from th e seafloor to 330.5 mbsf and then logged with the triple combo tool string. Further logging was canceled because of degrading hole conditions. The original plan called for a single hole to $320\;\mathrm{mbsf}$ . Poor recovery through a critical zone suggested an additional hole should be cored at the site. Th e APC/XCB coring system was selected for the second hole at the site. Hole U1572B was cored wit h the APC and HLAPC systems to APC refusal at 209.6 mbsf. The XCB system was deployed, an d the basement contact interval was cored to 224.3 mbsf. PDC XCB cutting shoes were used to cor e through the hard layers between 209.6 and 224.3 mbsf. Coring in Hole U1572B was terminated a t  

$1045\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 September. The drill string was pulled back to the surface after clearing the seafloo r at $1235~\mathrm{h}$ . On clearing the rotary table, the APC/XCB BHA was secured at $1612~\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hol e U1572B. The bridge was notified that the drill floor activities were complete. The thrusters an d hydrophones were pulled back inside the hull of the vessel, and the vessel began the sea passage t o Site U1573. A total of $122.5\,\mathrm{h}$ or 5.1 days were recorded while on Site U1572.  

A total of 79 cores were recorded for the site. The RCB system was used for Hole U1572A. Th e RCB system cored $330.5\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $139.53\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(42.2\%)$ ). Hole U1572B used the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems. There were 16 APC cores recorded over a $149.3\;\mathrm{m}$ interval. Recover y was $154.45\mathrm{~m~}$ , giving an efficiency of $103.5\%$ . The HLAPC system was used for 13 cores over  a $60.3\;\mathrm{m}$ interval and recovered $99.1\%$ of the cored interval. The XCB system was used for 4 core s over a $14.7~\mathrm{m}$ interval and recovered $28.3\%$ of the cored interval.

The succession recovered from the four holes cored at Sites U1571 and U1572 is divided into eigh t lithostratigraphic units. Units $\mathrm{I}{-}\mathrm{VI}$ are sedimentary, Unit VII is igneous, and Unit VIII is characterized by primarily igneous rock interbedded with sediment and volcaniclastics.  

Units were determined based on macroscopic observations and microscopic analysis and are supported by physical properties and biostratigraphy. Hole U1572A is the only hole that includes al l eight units. In Holes U1572B and U1571B, APC drilling was utilized, and recovery of sediments i s more than $100\%$ in many sediment cores. Where core recovery is low across unit boundaries o r fall-in drilling is observed, boundaries were placed at the top of the underlying unit. Unit I is grayish brown and brown unconsolidated mud. Unit II is greenish gray consolidated mud and nannofossil ooze. Unit III is greenish gray mud, very dark gray diatomite, and diatom ooze. Unit I V consists of greenish gray radiolarian ooze interbedded with gray to black ash. Unit V is very dar k gray mudstone with parallel lamination and dark gray ash. Unit VI is biosiliceous ooze with mudstone and common ash. Unit VII is basaltic andesite and basalt Lava Flows. Unit VIII consists o f basalt and interbasalt sediments and is divided into two distinct subunits. Subunit VIIIa is essentially composed of hyaloclastite alternating with volcanic mudstone. Subunit VIIIb is an alternation of basaltic lava flows and minor mudstone. The presence of Unit VII as the top basement uni t at Site U1572 constitutes the main difference between the two sites and likely is the reason for th e difference in seismic character.  

# 5.5.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

The Quaternary sediments recovered from the holes at Sites U1571 and U1572 $\operatorname*{max}=\sim\!80\,\mathrm{m})$ ) ar e (similar to most other holes drilled during Expedition 396) characterized by glacially influence d hemipelagic muds, which typically unconformably overlie Miocene strata. Siliceous and organicwalled microfossils were found in various abundances below the Quaternary deposits. Also, indications are that the successions at Sites U1571 and U1572 are very similar; lower to late Middl e Miocene strata overlie upper lower to upper Eocene strata, with some lower Oligocene sediments, especially in Hole U1572B.  

In Holes U1571B, U1572A, and U1572B, sediments recovered from directly above the igneou s facies yield Azolla spp. and associated dinocyst marker species. The well-documented Nordic Se a Azolla phase has been dated as occurring between ${\sim}49$ and $48\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (mid C22n to mid C21r) at th e end of the early Eocene (Ypresian) (e.g., Brinkhuis et al., 2006; Barke et al., 2011). This constrain s the earliest sediment accumulation to the very end of, or directly postdating, the EECO as define d by Westerhold et al. (2018). The middle to late Eocene appears to be marked by a progressiv e deepening or increasing distance to shore. Because of the general absence of microfossils, no biostratigraphic age constraints are available from in between the igneous facies.  

The microfossil-rich sedimentary succession in Hole U1572B was utilized to construct an integrated age-depth model, and the correlation to the shipboard paleomagnetic reversal interpretation and lithostratigraphic units is shown in Figure F16, Table T5, and Figure F17.  

# 5.5.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

The low recovery in Holes U1571A and U1572A prevents the construction of a meaningful magnetostratigraphic record; however, better magnetostratigraphic results were obtained from Hole s U1571B and U1572B. Lithostratigraphic Unit I sediments show mainly normal polarities in th e uppermost $40\;\mathrm{m}$ , although the increase of the I20mT/NRM ratio with depth suggests a possibl e climatic change. The upper and lowermost parts of Unit II show normal polarity with a revers e polarity in the lower part. Unit III has the lowest magnetic intensities $\mathrm{(INRM<10^{-4}\,A/m)}$ for thes e sites. The dominantly normal polarities might be caused by drilling-induced magnetization. Uni t IV shows evenly normal and reverse polarities. Unit V has exclusively normal polarities that ar e validated by discrete samples. Unit VI shows a mixture of normal and reverse polarities. Th e basaltic sequences show strong magnetization intensities with dominantly reverse polarities, al l validated by discrete samples. The magnetic carrier in these basalts has a low coercivity and ma y potentially carry a viscous remanent magnetization that could be used for core reorientation. Th e anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) of sediments shows that correction of magnetic inclination for inclination shallowing will not be necessary. The basalts carry a strong AMS resultin g from viscous flow.

# 5.5.3.4. Geochemistry  

The recovered basalt sequence from the Skoll High shows chemical and spatial variations betwee n Sites U1571 and U1572. For example, $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ concentrations indicate the presence of occasiona l high-Ti basalts, usually associated with LIPs and overlap with high-Ti basalts from East Greenlan d and flows found during previous drilling in Hole 642E during ODP Leg 104 (Figure F11). Th e compositions of the uppermost basalts at the two sites appear to be representative of two differen t flow units. This supports the lithostratigraphic interpretation, which indicates an additional uni t (VII) at the top of the basalts at Site U1572. IW recovered from intrabasalt sediments show s unusually high pH and low alkalinity for saline water. Basalt alteration and associated clay authigenesis at Sites U1571 and U1572 likely result in enriched IW Ca contents (released during cla y formation) and depleted Mg and K as these elements are incorporated into the clays. Elements i n IW samples from the basalt–sediment transition to $50{-}100\;\mathrm{m}$ above it show largely conservativ e behavior downcore. Dissolved silica concentrations are sporadically enriched, and these interval s corresponding to ash- and/or diatom-rich strata (e.g., Unit III). This is indicative of marine silicat e weathering, and the high interstitial silica preserves some original features of volcanic glass, diatoms, and organic matter.

# 5.5.3.5. Physical properties  

Shallow Quaternary Lithostratigraphic Unit 1 at Sites U1571 and U1572 comprises relatively hig h GRA bulk densities $({\sim}1.74\mathrm{~g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ and NGR (42 counts/s) that transition abruptly downward int o Units II and III, which generally comprise lower GRA bulk density $(\mathrm{{\sim}1.4\mathrm{-}1.5~g/c m^{3}})$ and NG R $^{\leftmoon}_{\setminus}23-25\right.$ counts/s) with an accompanying reduction in MS. The underlying Miocene to Eocen e strata comprising Units IV–VI are best preserved in Hole U1572B where Units IV and VI revea l elevated NGR (mean $=>\!30$ counts/s) compared with the intervening Unit V (mean $=21$ counts/s); MS is also elevated in these intervals, which is likely linked to increased ash content in the Eocene.  

The basaltic andesite–dominated Unit VII is characterized by high GRA bulk densities (2.5 3 $\mathbf{g}/\mathbf{cm}^{3})$ and $P$ -wave velocities $(4120\;\mathrm{m/s})$ and low NGR (11 counts/s) in line with the data recorde d for the basalt interiors found in Subunit VIIIb but at slightly higher NGR associated with the mor e evolved compositions. Point magnetic susceptibility (MSP) and MS (592 and $401\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}_{\rightmoon}$ ) are  a factor of 10 higher than for the overlying sedimentary units but about half that observed for th e underlying basalt-dominated Unit VIII.  

A clear distinction is seen between the hyaloclastite Subunit VIIIa and lava dominated Subuni t VIIIb. The former has relatively low $P$ -wave velocities $({\sim}1800\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ and GRA bulk densities $_{(\sim1.55}$ $\mathrm{{g}/\mathrm{{cm}^{3}})}$ ) more in line with the low velocity, low bulk density interbasaltic sediments. Basaltic Lav a Flow units from Unit VIII reveal clear asymmetrical profiles of $P$ -wave velocity and GRA bul k density ranging from $\sim5000\;\mathrm{m/s}$ and $2.9\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively, in the massive flow interiors to as lo w as ${\sim}2000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ and $1.5\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively, for porous and variably altered flow tops and bases. Calculated grain densities average $3~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ for the basaltic sequences and exceed $3.1~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in som e cases, attesting to the basic undifferentiated nature of the basaltic magmas that fed the sequence . Abundant primary pore spaces in the form of unfilled vesicles are identified throughout the volcanic sequence, leading to calculated porosities commonly ${>}30\%$ , whereas in certain cases thes e pores are filled with secondary minerals such as calcite and zeolite.

# 5.5.3.6. Downhole measurements  

Wireline logging operations at the Skoll High delivered a comprehensive data set covering approximately $147\,\mathrm{m}$ (about $80\,\mathrm{m}$ basaltic basement) in Hole U1571A and approximately $157\,\mathrm{m}$ (about 4 5 m basaltic basement) in Hole U1572A. Gamma radiation logging data aided in constraining th e nature and distribution of more evolved igneous compositions in an uppermost interval of mixe d volcanic and sedimentary interlayers. A key objective of the Skoll High sites was to constrain th e nature of different seismic facies associated with the top basalt reflector between the two sites, i n particular the “pitted surface” seismic facies associated with Hole U1572A. The transition fro m sediment to volcanic dominated sequences in Hole U1571A comprises a more protracte d sequence of interlayered hard volcanic units and softer sediments. In contrast, the transition fro m the sediments to the volcanic sequence is sharper in Hole U1572A, with an initial abrupt increas e in density, PEF, and MS followed by a gradual increase in density over the following ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ culminating in a sharp increase in resistivity at ${\sim}220\;\mathrm{m}$ . Core observations suggest abundant lava-wate r interaction for Lithostratigraphic Unit VIII, suggesting massive subaqueous flows and volcaniclastic units. This is consistent with the wireline data.  

Gamma radiation also aided the identification and thickness quantification of several interlav a sedimentary units that will form key future targets for palynology and isotopic age dating efforts t o appraise the timing and environmental conditions of the eruption sequence. FMS image log dat a revealed high resolution imaging of intricate volcanic intrafacies features such as ubiquitou s unfilled vesicles, mineralized amygdules, pipe vesicles, and pillow lava features indicative of aqueous eruptions during the volcanic pile evolution.  

# 5.6. Site U1573  

Site U1573 consisted of one RCB hole with the aim to characterize the basement nature of th e Outer SDRs. Hole U1573A resulted in coring about $90\,\mathrm{m}$ of late early Eocene sediments that lie o n top of basaltic basement. The $54~\mathrm{m}$ of drilled basement consists of massive sheet flows that wer e emplaced in a shallow marine setting and are interlayered by sediments. The upper $300\;\mathrm{m}$ of th e shallow sediments at the site were washed because an approaching storm did not leave enoug h time to core the entire hole.  

# 5.6.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1573 (proposed Site VMVM-09A) is located in the southern part of the Lofoten Basin jus t north of the Vøring Plateau at a $3167~\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figure F15). This part of the Vøring Margi n has rarely been explored sine the 1960s and 1970s. Site U1573 is located on Magnetic Anomaly 2 3 near the border between the Vøring and Lofoten Margins. The only available basement sample s prior to Expedition 396 in this area are from DSDP Leg 38 Site 343 (Talwani, M., Udintsev, G., e t al., 1976), during which basement from 253 to 284 mbsf was drilled and about $5\,\mathrm{m}$ of highly altere d basalts that were interpreted to be part of a sill intrusion were recovered.  

Compared to the Vøring Margin, the Lofoten Margin is characterized by a narrower rift system, less extensive breakup-related magmatic crustal thickening, and a rapid increase of water dept h from the shelf into the Lofoten Basin. The Lofoten Margin consists of three segments that ar e characterized by different fault dip directions and separated by crustal transfer systems (Tsikala s et al., 2001). The southernmost transfer system, the Bivrost Lineament, separates the Lofote n Margin from the Vøring Margin. Wide-angle seismic data suggest about $12\,\mathrm{km}$ thick oceanic crus t in the southern part of the Lofoten Basin, much thinner than the about $20\;\mathrm{km}$ thick crust of th e Vøring Plateau (Breivik et al., 2009). This difference in crustal thickness should have resulted in  a very different vertical movement history of the Lofoten Margin than that of the Vøring Margin.  A previously calculated early Eocene bathymetric gradient from the Vøring to the Lofoten Margin o f a $500{-}1000\ \mathrm{m}$ water depth on the Lofoten Margin during breakup (Tsikalas et al., 2008) woul d imply submarine lava emplacement on the Lofoten Margin as opposed to the subaerial volcani c emplacement environment on the Vøring Margin (Eldholm et al., 1989). This bathymetric gradien t has been attributed to rapid initial margin subsidence along a deep-rooted low-angle detachmen t fault (Tsikalas et al., 2008). Reflection seismic data reveal a horizontal basement reflection underlain by SDRs with lower seismic amplitude and shorter lateral extent than the main set of SDRs o n the Vøring Margin. These Outer SDRs are a common feature of volcanic rifted margins and hav e been interpreted as submarine Lava Flows (Berndt et al., 2001b).  

The stark difference between the observed subaerial Lava Flows at ODP Site 642 and the submarine conditions predicted by gravity modeling require a distinctly different subsidence history fo r the Vøring and Lofoten Margins. Thus, the first objective of drilling Site U1573 was to obtai n information on the emplacement environment based on the facies of the recovered basalt and sediments. As such, reaching this first objective directly tests the predictions of the concept of seismi c volcanostratigraphy. The second objective was to establish the timing of volcanism on the Lofote n Margin, in particular whether there is evidence of a time gap between the emplacement of th e SDRs of the Vøring Margin on Skoll High (Sites U1571 and U1572) and the Outer SDRs. The thir d objective of Site U1573 was to constrain the conditions in the melt region during the presumabl y late phase of breakup volcanism. This includes not only any constraints on the composition of th e mantle before melting and the ambient temperature and pressure from the geochemistry an d petrology of the encountered rocks but also any signs of evolution of the melts in crustal magm a chambers during breakup volcanism.  

# 5.6.2. Operations  

Site U1573 consisted of a single hole drilled first without coring using the RCB system with a center bit from the seafloor to 300.0 mbsf and then cored to a final depth of 440.9 mbsf, including 54. 4 m into basement. The average penetration rate in the basement section was ${\sim}1.82~\mathrm{m/h}$ . Ther e were frequent jammed liners and core catchers which contributed to relatively low core recover y rates within basement (average $=43\%$ ). Coring in Hole U1573A was terminated at $1830~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 0 September 2021 because of severe weather and heavy sea conditions that were expected over th e operational area for the following day. The last core recovered was Core 396-U1573A-19R at 192 5 h on 20 September. The drill string was pulled back on board at $2200~\mathrm{h}$ . The BHA was broke n down, and the drill collars were secured in the drill collar rack. The rig floor was secured at $0705\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 September, ending Hole U1573A and Site U1573. A total of $101.0\,\mathrm{h}$ or 4.2 days were spent o n site. A total of 18 cores were recovered using the RCB system over $140.9\mathrm{~m~}$ recovering $101\,\textrm{m}$ $(72\%)$ .  

# 5.6.3. Principal results  

# 5.6.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Site U1573 consists of a single hole that was drilled to 440.9 mbsf, with the recovered core interva l spanning 300 to $440.9\;\mathrm{mbsf}.$ The $140.9\;\mathrm{m}$ thick succession consists of both sediments and basalt s that are divided into four lithostratigraphic units. The criteria for the division of the units ar e based on significant lithologic changes, which are supported by physical properties variability. Units I–III are sedimentary, and Unit IV consists of basalt and interbasaltic sediments.  

• Unit I consists of dark greenish gray to very dark gray claystone with rare weak parallel lamination or fining-upward sequences. Slight to heavy bioturbation is present throughout the unit and, diagenetic pyrite is observed locally.   
• Unit II consists of dark greenish gray to very dark gray claystone with moderate bioturbation alternating with very dark gray organic-rich claystone with thin parallel lamination. Rare ash beds or ash-rich beds are present locally.   
• Unit III consists of very dark gray to very dark bluish gray volcaniclastic claystone mudstone with sand.   
• Unit IV consists mainly of gray to dark gray aphyric aphanitic to phaneritic basalt and interbasaltic claystone to sandstone.  

# 5.6.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

All sedimentary core catcher samples and selected samples from intercalated sedimentary beds i n the igneous facies from Hole U1573A were processed for calcareous, siliceous, and organic microfossils. Calcareous and siliceous biogenic material was largely absent, with the exception of rar e calcareous nannofossil occurrences in the lower several meters above basalt. However, most samples were productive for palynology, including some samples from between the igneous facies, an d most yielded age diagnostic dinocysts, which indicate a late early Eocene age for the entire interval.  

# 5.6.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I is characterized by an average intensity of magnetization of $0.05\,\mathrm{A/m}$ an d a median coercivity of 2.73. This coercivity may be owed to sedimentary hematite or goethite. Th e unique discrete sample measured is not ferromagnetic, devoid of magnetite, because the averag e bulk MS is $0.447\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{SI}$ .  

Unit II has an $0.05\,\mathrm{A/m}$ average intensity of magnetization. The median coercivity (3.04), MS ( $[\mathrm{K}<$ $1.03\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{SI})$ ), and corrected degree of anisotropy $(\mathrm{Pj}<1.105)$ are higher than in Unit I. High K i s owed to small contributions from magnetite. High coercivity and Pj may be due to a highe r goethite/hematite ratio and/or a larger iron sulfide (e.g., pyrrhotite) population in the ash. Multiple minerals carrying remanence are evident from the three types of remanent magnetizatio n identified in four discrete samples. The low and medium coercivity component is erased by AFs o f 20 and $70\;\mathrm{mT},$ , respectively. The high coercivity component is stable throughout the demagnetization process, specifically in the $120\;\mathrm{mT}$ field.  

Unit III has an average magnetization intensity of $0.07\;\mathrm{A/m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , which is slightly higher than Units  I and II. In contrast, the medium coercivity (2.53) is lower than in Units I and II. Lower media n coercivity can be related to domination of volcanic material, which usually is richer in iron sulfid e (e.g., pyrrhotite) but poorer in goethite and hematite. Note that goethite and hematite have highe r coercivity than iron sulfides. No discrete samples were measured.  

Unit IV has high average magnetization intensity $\left(2.6\mathrm{\A/m}\right)$ and high median coercivity (6.02). Such high coercivities may be owed to a larger goethite/hematite ratio. The unit is ferromagneti c with the highest bulk MS of all the units, indicating the dominance of magnetite. However, th e corrected degree of anisotropy is the lowest among all the units. This indicates that the magneti c fabrics are carried dominantly by magnetite and the populations of pyrrhotite and hematite ar e small. Three magnetization components are conspicuous from the demagnetization behavior o f the discrete samples.  

Unit I has four short periods of magnetic reversals between Sections 396-U1573A-2R-1 (30 0 mbsf) and 2R-5 $(306.71\;\mathrm{m})$ . This is followed by a long episode of magnetic reversal in Sections 4R2 (321.05 mbsf) through 5R-5 (333.91 mbsf) in Unit II. After this, the magnetic polarity flips several times at a relatively higher frequency (within a couple meters) until Section 7R-3 (350.9 8 mbsf). It then remains reversed through Section 8R-3 (361.72 mbsf). After that, the polarity stay s dominantly normal in the rest of the hole through Section 18R-2 (436.74 mbsf). Preliminary dat a from paleomagnetic analyses suggest a predominance of normal polarity at the top of the core d succession, which we tentatively assign to magnetochron C22n (48.57–49.34 Ma).  

# 5.6.3.4. Geochemistry  

Site U1573 in the Lofoten Basin provided a unique opportunity to sample an Outer SDR sequenc e on a magma-rich passive continental margin. The sampled lavas are noteworthy in that the highe r silica and low-Ti compositions are chemically distinct from both typical mid-ocean-ridge basalt s and LIP magmatism. The sedimentary package recovered above the lavas is limited to $100\;\mathrm{m}$ . A s seen at previous sites, high organic matter production and/or preservation is found in volcaniclastic sediments, suggesting a causal relationship. The IW samples show a diagenetic environmen t controlled by basalt weathering, with processes consuming alkalinity in the overlying sedimentar y strata. There is also strong evidence of authigenic carbonate formation above the sediment/basal t contact, linked to the liberation of calcium during the weathering of primary silicates.  

# 5.6.3.5. Physical properties  

Sedimentary Units I and II are characterized by downward increasing density (from ${\sim}1.6$ to ${\sim}2$ $\mathbf{g}/\mathbf{cm}^{3})$ consistent with increasing compaction. NGR values fluctuate between ${\sim}30$ and 60 counts/ s and display a general increase with depth over Units I and II. Increased scatter in MS is observe d over ash-rich intervals within sedimentary sections. The hard rock basement sequence comprise s generally very low NGR values, typically under 10 counts/s, consistent with the basalt-dominate d compositions and has generally high density (mean GRA bulk density $=2.28~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ ; mean MA D grain density $=2.83\;\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ ) and velocities $\mathrm{(mean=3660\;m/s)}$ ). The presence and nature of interlav a sediments with lower velocity $({\sim}2000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ compared to the higher velocity basaltic flows $[{\sim}4500$ $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s},$ ) give first insights into the geological causes of the Outer SDR seismic reflectivity.  

# 5.7. Site U1574  

Three holes were drilled at Site U1574 targeting the basement and the overlying sedimentar y sequence of an Outer High, Eldhø, located on the northern flank of the Vøring Plateau. Hol e U1574A was drilled with the RCB system and sampled $94\;\mathrm{m}$ of pillow basalts, hyaloclastites, and  a ${\sim}30\;\mathrm{m}$ thick interbasalt sedimentary interval. Both triple combo and FMS-sonic wireline log dat a were acquired in the basement. Only one APC core was collected in Hole U1574B, whereas  a $^{170}\,\mathrm{m}$ thick sequence of sediments was almost completely recovered using APC coring in Hol e U1574C. The last core of the expedition was an XCB core recovering $1.5~\mathrm{m}$ of spectacular pillo w basalts, sediments, and hyaloclastites.  

# 5.7.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1574 (proposed Site VMVM-80A) probes the top of an Outer High called Eldhø (Figur e F15). It is located on the northern flank of the Vøring Plateau at a $2825\ \mathrm{m}$ water depth. Oute r Highs are conspicuous volcanic seismic facies units that are located seaward of the Inner SD R facies units (Hopper et al., 1992; Planke et al., 2000; Franke et al., 2019). Although most volcani c seismic facies units are relatively continuous along a rifted margin, Outer Highs have a limite d lateral extent of typically $10{-}20\ \mathrm{km}$ (Berndt et al., 2001a). They form elongate structures that ris e above the top of the adjacent Inner and Outer SDRs. Seismically, Outer Highs frequently display  a high-amplitude top reflection of normal seismic polarity, chaotic internal reflection patterns, an d high-amplitude reflections that extend from the Outer High into adjacent sedimentary sequence s that overlie the SDRs.  

Because Outer Highs are characteristic features of volcanic rifted margins located between Inne r and Outer SDRs, their presence likely signifies specific geological processes and provides clues t o the evolution of volcanic passive margins. The precruise interpretations of Outer Highs mainl y relied on seismic volcanostratigraphic interpretations, field analogs, and geological reasoning. Th e facies unit was interpreted as dominantly hyaloclastite deposits formed when the eruption fissure s were submerged during the initial phase of seafloor spreading. In this situation, eruptions woul d happen at sea level or in shallow marine conditions and lava would get into direct contact wit h seawater leading to phreatomagmatic eruptions. The formation of Surtsey between 1964 and 196 8 may serve as a recent analog (Kokelaar, 1983).  

The structure targeted at Site U1574 is a typical example of an Outer High (Figure F7B). We cal l this structure Eldhø, meaning fire mountain in Scandinavian languages. The name is also inspire d by the achievements of Professor Olav Eldholm, who was a pioneer in drilling and defining th e concepts of volcanic margins and LIPs (e.g., Eldholm et al., 1989). Eldhø rises more than $1500\;\mathrm{m}$ above the adjacent Inner SDRs in the southeast and about $650\textrm{m}$ above the Outer SDRs in th e northwest with numerous high-amplitude seismic reflections that transgress into the adjacen t sedimentary basins south of the high. Its lateral extent is about $17~\mathrm{km}$ in the dip (northwest– southeast) direction and about $30~\mathrm{km}$ along strike (southwest–northeast). A sedimentary basin , the Eldhø Basin, which has kilometer-thick postbasalt sediment deposits, is located landward o f Eldhø.  

The first objective of Site U1574 was to obtain information on the emplacement environmen t based on observations of the drilled volcanic facies. If Eldhø was indeed emplaced close to se a level, this will validate these aspects of seismic volcanostratigraphy, and their presence may the n be used as a marker for vertical movement. The second objective was to constrain the condition s in the melt region, specifically the composition of the mantle before melting and the ambient temperature and pressure conditions in the melt region during the late phase of breakup volcanis m based on the geochemical composition and petrology of the encountered rocks. Reaching the firs t two objectives will allow to parameterize geodynamic models for excessive breakup volcanism.  

Site U1574 was also drilled to provide information on the suitability of the breakup basal t sequences and interbedded sediments for permanent geological storage of $C O_{2}$ . If the Outer High s indeed consist mainly of hyaloclastite deposits as postulated, they should be characterized by hig h porosity and permeability, which may make them a suitable target $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ storage. Finally, we hope d to obtain information on the earliest incursion of deep water into the North Atlantic and th e extent of freshwater incursions into the young ocean during the early to middle Eocene (Brinkhui s et al., 2006) by coring the overlying sedimentary strata.  

# 5.7.2. Operations  

Site U1574 consisted of three holes. The first hole was cored using the RCB coring system from th e seafloor to 260.0 mbsf and then logged with the triple combo and FMS-sonic logging tool strings. The original plan for Site U1574 was to core a single hole to 310 mbsf, but the objectives wer e achieved by 260 mbsf. After completing Hole U1574A, the Co-Chief Scientists decided to use th e remaining expedition time to piston core the sediment section above the basement and to attemp t to improve recovery of the sediment/basement interface. The APC/XCB coring system wa s selected for the second hole at the site. After assembling and lowering the APC/XCB system to th e seafloor, the first APC core misfired and penetrated the seafloor at least twice. Hole U1574B wa s terminated after the poor mudline core at 9.5 mbsf. The vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ south, and Hol e U1574C was piston cored to 169.2 mbsf. We conducted four borehole temperature measurement s with the advanced piston corer temperature (APCT-3) tool on Cores 396-U1574C-4H $(38.0\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ , 7H (66.1 mbsf), 10H (94.6 mbsf), and 13H (118.7 mbsf). The Icefield MI-5 core orientation too l was deployed for the first 10 cores. The XCB coring system was deployed after the last APC cor e and immediately cored basement. A PDC XCB cutting shoe was used to core a hard layer a t 169.2 mbsf. Coring in Hole U1574C was terminated at $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 October 2021 at a final dept h of 171.5 mbsf. The last core was on deck at $1655\,\mathrm{h}$ . All coring tools were put away. The drill strin g was pulled back to the surface after clearing the seafloor at $1920\,\mathrm{h}$ . The drill collars were laid ou t to the drill collar racks and the outer core barrel was disassembled and secured. The drill floor wa s secured for transit at $0231\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 October, ending Hole U1574C and Site U1574. A total of $182.5\,\mathrm{h}$ or 7.6 days were recorded while on Site U1574.  

A total of 59 cores were recorded for the site. The RCB system was used exclusively for Hol e U1574A. It cored $260.0\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $88.41\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(34\%)$ . The APC system was used in bot h Holes U1574B and U1574C. There were 20 APC cores recovered over a 178.7 interval. The recovery for the 20 cores was $183.27\;\mathrm{m}\;(103\%)$ . The XCB system was used for 1 core over a $2.3\;\mathrm{m}$ interval and recovered $64\%$ of the cored interval.  

# 5.7.3. Principal results  

# 5.7.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Site U1574 is located on the lower slope of the Vøring Plateau, on the southern flank of Eldhø. Thi s Outer High was likely formed by subaqueous volcanism during the initial phase of seafloo r spreading. The succession of recovered material consists of both sediments and basalts and i s divided into five lithostratigraphic units. The division of the units is based on changes in lithology, which coincide with changes in physical property trends. Units I–IV are sedimentary, and Unit  V consists of basalt, hyaloclastite, and minor interbasaltic sediments.  

Unit I consists of brown and brownish gray unconsolidated mud with intervals of rare pebbles, likely related to ice rafted debris, and rare to common foraminifers.  

Unit II consists of pale yellow and grayish green consolidated mud, in which the first Eocene-age d dinocyst zonations are encountered.  

Unit III is very dark gray mudstone with rare beds of sandstone and ash and some parallel lamination and bioturbation, showing an increase in organic content downhole.  

Unit IV is very dark gray to very dark grayish brown organic rich mudstone with thin paralle l lamination. Compared to overlying units, Unit IV is richer in foraminifers and nannofossils, wit h abundances increasing downhole in the unit.  

Unit V mainly consists of aphyric- to plagioclase-phyric pillow basalt with localized hyaloclastit e and rare interbedded mudstone. Unit V is divided into two subunits (Va and Vb) based on lithologic and geochemical variations. The two subunits are separated by a large interval of no recover y to very poor recovery of sediments, and both are overlain by hyaloclastites. Subunit Va contain s both massive and pillow basalts and shows significant variation of composition with depth. Subunit Vb contains primarily pillow basalt and presents remarkably uniform composition.  

# 5.7.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

Site U1574 holes comprise up to ${\sim}170\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sedimentary strata above the igneous basement. Except for Cores 396-U1574A-1R through 3R, all sedimentary core catcher samples from Hol e U1574A were processed for palynology. These samples, including two taken from between basal t flows (Samples 32R-CC and 33R-CC), are assigned a late early Eocene age based on marker dinocyst taxa and broader assemblage characteristics. The overlying Quaternary strata yield calcareous and rare biosiliceous fossil remains, but these are largely absent from most of the expande d late early Eocene strata. A significant exception is the lower ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment on top of th e igneous basement (Samples 17R-CC and 18R-CC), which contains calcareous remains, includin g calcareous nannofossils, planktonic and benthic foraminifers, and micromolluscs, and include s fine preservation of aragonitic pteropods. Benthic foraminifers are mostly mineral filled, an d diatoms are replaced by or coated with pyrite microframboids. These samples are tentativel y attributed to planktonic foraminifer Zone E7a of Wade et al. (2011), in line with inferences fro m dinocyst biostratigraphy.  

# 5.7.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Lithostratigraphic Units I–III are characterized by low average intensity of magnetization (0.02, 0.006, and $0.02\,\mathrm{A/m},$ respectively), whereas their median coercivity is 1.69, 1.31, and 0.87, respectively. The lower intensity of magnetization and coercivity may be owed to a smaller population o f magnetic minerals. No discrete samples were measured for these three units. Unit IV has a slightl y higher average intensity of magnetization $(0.006\,\mathrm{A/m})$ than Units I–II. The bulk MS is $1.06\times10^{-3}$ to . $014\times10^{-3}$ SI, indicating a ferro $^+$ paramagnetic AMS without magnetite. Median coercivit y (2.61) is much higher than in Units I–III. The corrected degree of anisotropy in the range of ${\sim}1.1$ and median coercivity of 2.61 indicate the absence of micaceous minerals and a higher populatio n of goethite and hematite, respectively. Only one of the two discrete samples presents stable magnetization directions (Sample 396-U1574A-17R-1, $111{-}113\ \mathrm{cm})$ ). The low coercivity remanen t magnetization component is erased by a field of $10\,\mathrm{mT}$ The high coercivity component is remove d at an applied field of $100\;\mathrm{mT}$ .  

The average intensity of magnetization $(4.38\,\mathrm{A/m})$ in Unit V is several orders of magnitude highe r than in the other units. The median coercivity (2.61) is the same as in Unit IV. The bulk MS i s ${\sim}15\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{SI},$ , and the corrected degree of anisotropy is ${\sim}1.1$ . Two magnetization components ar e evident. The low coercivity component is erased by application of a field of $10\:\mathrm{mT}$ . The high coercivity component is removed by a field of $40{-}60~\mathrm{mT}$ . The magnetic signals are apparently carrie d by magnetite.  

Magnetic polarity is normal through Section 396-U1574A-4R-2 (31.05 mbsf). The polarity then remains dominantly reversed to the bottom of the hole (Section 38R-3; 258.15 mbsf). This long, dominantly reverse polarity episode is truncated by short-lived positive polarity events.  

# 5.7.3.4. Geochemistry  

Site U1574 consists of two holes, one that targeted the basement (U1574A) and one that wa s aimed at obtaining high recovery of the overlying sediments (U1574C). The hard rock sample d from Hole U1574A consists of low-Ti basalts. Significant variability of some geochemical parameters $\begin{array}{r}{(\mathrm{TiO}_{2},\,\mathrm{Mg}\#,}\end{array}$ Ni, and Zr) downcore suggests recovery of multiple flow units. Interbasalt sediments contain what appears to be dolomite.  

The sediments consist of an expanded section from the early late Eocene period. IW composition s indicate a diagenetic environment dominated by the weathering of primary silicate phases and th e formation of authigenic clays and carbonate. Calcium and strontium decrease downcore due t o their release in the formation of smectite and other clay minerals. The same formation reaction s lead to the removal of Mg and K from the IW, resulting in decreasing Mg and K content downcore. Enrichment of other elements (e.g., Si and B) in the upper $40\;\mathrm{m}$ of the core suggest a lithologycontrolled elemental composition of the IW.  

# 5.7.3.5. Physical properties  

The uppermost Lithostratigraphic Unit I has high bulk densities $\mathrm{(mean}=1.82\mathrm{~g/cm^{3}})$ and NG R values (average $=38$ counts/s) and relatively low $P$ -wave velocities $({\sim}1575\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ and magnetic susceptibilities $(\sim\!45\,\times\,10^{-5}\,\,\mathrm{SI})$ ). Eight MAD samples collected throughout this unit have an averag e bulk density of $1.82\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , grain density of $2.76\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and porosity of $54\%$ . Six thermal conductivity measurements range from 1.1 to $1.5\:\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ and have an average of $1.3\:\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ .  

In Unit II, $P$ -wave velocities, GRA bulk densities, magnetic susceptibilities, and NGR averag e ${\sim}1550\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , $1.43\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , ${\sim}21\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ , and 19 counts/s, respectively. Analysis of two MAD sample s revealed very high porosities of $83\%$ , a grain density of $2.70\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and a bulk density of $1.31\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , consistent with poorly compacted clay-rich sediments.  

A total of 25 discrete MAD sample analyses indicate a mean bulk density of $1.59\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ for the ${\sim}90$ m thick Eocene Unit III, slightly lower than the mean GRA bulk density of $1.62\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Porositie s range from $37\%$ to $82\%$ . The baseline values of the measured physical properties generally increas e with depth throughout Unit III. Whole-round $P$ -wave velocity values average $1560\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , ${\sim}250\ \mathrm{m/s}$ slower than velocities measured through 30 discrete $P.$ -wave caliper measurements using th e SHMG, and have a significant spread with a standard deviation of $120.5\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . MS increases compared to the overlying Unit II (average $=105\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}_{\rightmoon}$ ) and features increased scattering linked t o the occurrence of ash layers.  

Reduced MS scatter $(\mathrm{mean}\,=\,{\sim}\,90\,\times\,10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI})$ is observed for the underlying Unit IV. Mean GR A $({\sim}1.83\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ and MAD $(\mathrm{n}=8,\mathrm{\sim}1.73\:\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ bulk densities correspond well to an associated average porosity of $59\%$ . Whole-round $P$ -wave velocities with a mean of $1565\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ are within $20\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ o f the mean recorded using $P$ -wave caliper measurements and similar to average $P.$ -wave velocitie s found for Unit III. NGR values increase slightly compared to the overlying unit and have a constant value around 51 counts/s.  

The massive basalt and pillow basalts from Unit V have significantly higher $P$ -wave velocities, bul k densities $(2.4{-}2.6\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , and magnetic susceptibilities $\mathrm{{}^{1000-2000\times10^{-5}\,S I)}}$ than those found fo r the overlying sedimentary successions. Similar to interbasaltic sediments, the NGR counts, $P.$ - wave velocities, and bulk densities measured for the hyaloclastite intervals feature a similar bu t inverse response to those measured for the pillow and massive basalts because $P$ -wave velocitie s were on average $1000{-}1500\ \mathrm{m/s}$ lower than the $4000{-}5000~\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ typically associated with the pillow lavas and massive intervals. Mean $P$ -wave velocities of the massive basalt intervals typicall y featured on the lower end of this range. The unit has relatively low porosities $(15\%{-}20\%)$ , althoug h significantly higher porosities are recorded for the interbasaltic layers.  

# 5.7.3.6. Downhole logging  

The priority target for Hole U1574A was to characterize the basement nature of Eldhø. Loggin g operations collected important data for intervals with poor core recovery in challenging loggin g conditions where hole instability resulted in only partial data collection for the bottom ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m}$ o f the open hole section. The basaltic composition pillow lavas are characterized by high densitie s $({\sim}2.6~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ and fluctuating velocities ranging from ${\sim}3$ to $5.2\;\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ with associated low gamm a radiation values $(\sim\!9\;\mathrm{gAPI})$ . FMS imaging of the formation reveals pillow structures and the presence of Lava Flow units, which correspond to highly vesicular basalt in the recovered core. Wireline data also show the presence of three thin elevated gamma radiation sediment layers along wit h a much thicker interval of high gamma radiation $({\sim}70\,\mathrm{gAPI})$ stratigraphy associated with an interval of ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ with almost no core recovery. This layer is imaged with the FMS, which records  a resistive fractured nature with traces of potential pillow-like features and possible sediment layering toward the base.  

# 6. Preliminary scientific assessment  

During Expedition 396, we collected data from 21 boreholes in five different geological setting s along the volcanic rifted margin off mid-Norway. The boreholes probe almost all elements of  a typical volcanic rifted margin and the associated sedimentary archive. Recovery ranges from th e subbasalt stratigraphy through hydrothermal vent complex deposits, thick flood basalts deposit s in SDR sequences to postbreakup phreatomagmatic volcanoes, and basalts representing thickene d oceanic crust formed during early seafloor spreading. The cored sediments include a comprehensive record of the upper Paleocene and lower Eocene strata, including expanded sections of th e PETM. Thick lower Eocene sediments recovered above the top basalt horizon document the environment and subsidence history of the margin during the initial stages of northeast Atlanti c Ocean formation. Along with an enormous amount of high-quality 2-D and 3-D seismic data an d legacy boreholes from DSDP, ODP, and the NPD, Expedition 396 results will allow us to assess an d reevaluate the development of volcanic rifted margins and the implications of LIPs on paleoclimate and mass extinctions.  

The first main objective of the expedition was to constrain the tectonomagmatic processes tha t lead to excess volcanism during the formation of a new ocean. Magmatism is controlled by th e composition and rheological properties of the upper mantle, the initial pressure and temperatur e conditions, and the tectonically controlled unloading of the mantle through space and time. Thes e boundary conditions will ultimately control the response of the system, including induced convection, passive, and active upwelling—processes that move mantle material into the melt window. We drilled $587\,\textrm{m}$ of breakup-related basalts in eight different holes that cover a wide range o f compositions. Cores from these holes will allow us to constrain the pressure and temperature conditions and the composition of the upper mantle during various phases of breakup volcanis m through geochemical analyses, whereas the age of the magmatism will be constrained by geochronological analyses. The igneous rocks comprise the main Inner SDR units, the Outer High, and th e Outer SDR unit as well as an enigmatic dacitic lava flow along the Vøring transform margin. Thes e Expedition 396 data will be complemented by boreholes into a lava delta on the Møre Margin b y NPD and samples of the earliest lava flows on the Vøring Margin that were recovered in ODP Hol e 642E. High-precision radiometric dating, biostratigraphy of intrabasalt sediments, and paleomagnetic studies will allow us to constrain the age and rates of the magmatism in unprecedente d detail. Furthermore, the samples allow a direct assessment of the paleowater depth, specifically, subaerial vs. marine emplacement of the extrusive basalts. Along with paleoenvironmental studie s of the immediate sedimentary succession above the basalts by biostratigraphic and sedimentological analyses, this will constrain the vertical movements of the margin and by proxy (and in conjunction with the geophysically constrained magmatic crustal thickening) the rifting history of th e margin. This is a main boundary condition for numerical simulation of the tectonomagmati c breakup processes that will allow us to reach the first objective of the expedition.  

The second main objective of the expedition was to study the environmental consequences o f breakup volcanism through time. Breakup volcanism in the North Atlantic was accompanied by  a phase of rapid global warming, the so-called PETM. With the results of Expedition 396, we wil l test the hypothesis that the observed global warming was induced by magmatic intrusions into th e surrounding sedimentary basins. It has been proposed that the intrusions led to contact metamorphism in the host rock and expulsion of carbon-bearing hydrothermal fluids through pipe-lik e vent complexes into the young ocean basin and from there onward into the atmosphere.  

During Expedition 396, we successfully recovered $240\textrm{m}$ of sediments of PETM age from eigh t boreholes within vent structures and their immediate vicinity in the southern Vøring Basin (Figur e F8). These cores will allow to test the hypothesis by biostratigraphic, sedimentological, and geochemical analyses along with integration of wireline logs and high-resolution 3-D seismic data.  A total of $1955\mathrm{~m~}$ of Paleocene and Eocene age sedimentary rocks were drilled during Expeditio n  

396, with a recovery of $1125\;\mathrm{m}$ $(58\%)$ (Table T6). These cores represent a comprehensive archiv e of the environmental changes that took place from the onset of the EECO through the PETM an d into the middle and late Eocene. The proxy data derived from the postcruise analyses will provid e insights into the various drivers and responses in the earth system during these times of a globa l hothouse climate and subsequent cooling.  

The comprehensive Expedition 396 database will also be used to study the opening of the nort h Atlantic seaways, the onset of ocean circulation patterns, and the occurrence of freshwater incursions into the young ocean basins. We have encountered the remains of the freshwater fern Azolla spp. in several of the expedition boreholes, and further analyses will provide a crucial documentation between its massive occurrence in the Arctic Ocean, Norwegian Greenland Sea, and Nort h Sea areas and sites in the Labrador Sea on the east coast of North America.  

Finally, the recovered $587~\mathrm{m}$ of various basaltic facies units will be invaluable to achieve the othe r secondary objective, namely, the study of the suitability of the breakup basalt successions for th e permanent storage of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . Some of the recovered basalts are very vesicular providing large reaction surfaces, making them potential reservoir rocks for permanent carbon storage. Detailed analyses and integration with geophysical data will allow us to extrapolate these findings in thre e dimensions and form the basis for a robust assessment of the storage potential.  

In spite of the ambitious work program set out in the expedition’s Scientific Prospectus, it wa s possible to significantly surpass our operational and scientific objectives. The expedition result s provide a much broader than anticipated scientific database and should allow us to reach all th e expedition’s objectives during postcruise work.

# 7. Outreach  

The onshore participants of Expedition 396 included an outreach officer from the United State s who communicated the goals of the expedition to students and the public across the globe throug h live broadcasts and social media with the support of shipboard scientists and marine technicians.  

Using the direct satellite link, computer devices, and Zoom videoconferencing software, expedition scientists and the outreach officer connected with people all over the world. A typical sessio n included an introduction to the current location and expedition goals followed by a tour of th e laboratories. Scientists were stationed at each laboratory to give an overview of the science bein g conducted and to answer questions. We finished each live event with a $10{-}15\ \mathrm{min}$ question an d answer session.  

During Expedition 396, we completed 15 broadcasts and connected with 794 participants in 7 different countries. We also conducted 2 live events on YouTube, which had 677 views by the end o f the expedition.  

The outreach officer managed the JOIDES Resolution Expedition 396 website (https://joidesresolution.org/expedition/mid-norwegian-continental-margin-magmatism) and completed seve n blog entries on various topics ranging from the expedition scientific objectives to expeditionrelated science topics and sailing in the time of COVID-19. The expedition website and blog post s totaled over 1000 views by the end of the expedition.  

The outreach officer and the onboard imaging specialist also added at least one post every day t o the JOIDES Resolution Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram social media accounts, totaling 258 post s by the end of the expedition. These posts were seen a total of 374,000 times and resulted in a n increase of 51 new Instagram followers, 445 new Twitter followers, and 118 new Facebook pag e fans over the 2 month expedition. That is a total increase of 614 newly engaged individuals.
