# Abstract  

The Amundsen Sea sector of Antarctica has long been considered the most vulnerable part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) because of the great water depth at the grounding line, a subglacial bed seafloor deepening toward the interior of the continent, and the absence of substantial ice shelves. Glaciers in this configuration are thought to be susceptible to rapid or runaway retreat. Ice flowing into the Amundsen Sea Embayment is undergoing the most rapid changes of any sector of the Antarctic ice sheets outside the Antarctic Peninsula, including substantial grounding-line retreat over recent decades, as observed from satellite data. Recent models suggest that a threshold leading to the collapse of WAIS in this sector may have been already crossed and that much of the ice sheet could be lost even under relatively moderate greenhouse gas emission scenarios.  

Drill cores from the Amundsen Sea provide tests of several key questions about controls on ice sheet stability. The cores offer a direct offshore record of glacial history in a sector that is exclusively influenced by ice draining the WAIS, which allows clear comparisons between the WAIS history and low-latitude climate records. Today, relatively warm (modified) Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) is impinging onto the Amundsen Sea shelf and causing melting under ice shelves and at the grounding line of the WAIS in most places. Reconstructions of past CDW intrusions can assess the ties between warm water upwelling and large-scale changes in past grounding-line positions. Carrying out these reconstructions offshore from the drainage basin that currently has the most substantial negative mass balance of ice anywhere in Antarctica is thus of prime interest to future predictions.  

The scientific objectives for this expedition are built on hypotheses about WAIS dynamics and related paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic conditions. The main objectives are  

1. To test the hypothesis that WAIS collapses occurred during the Neogene and Quaternary and, if so, when and under which environmental conditions;   
2. To obtain ice-proximal records of ice sheet dynamics in the Amundsen Sea that correlate with global records of ice-volume changes and proxy records for atmospheric and ocean temperatures;   
3. To study the stability of a marine-based WAIS margin and how warm deepwater incursions control its position on the shelf;   
4. To find evidence for the earliest major grounded WAIS advances onto the middle and outer shelf;   
5. To test the hypothesis that the first major WAIS growth was related to the uplift of the Marie Byrd Land dome.  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 379 completed two very successful drill sites on the continental rise of the Amundsen Sea. Site U1532 is located on a large sediment drift, now called the Resolution Drift, and it penetrated to $794\mathrm{~m~}$ with $90\%$ recovery. We collected almost-continuous cores from recent age through the Pleistocene and Pliocene and into the upper Miocene. At Site U1533, we drilled $383\;\mathrm{m}$ $70\%$ recovery) into the mor e condensed sequence at the lower flank of the same sediment drift. The cores of both sites contain unique records that will enable stud y of the cyclicity of ice sheet advance and retreat processes as well a s ocean-bottom water circulation and water mass changes. In particular, Site U1532 revealed a sequence of Pliocene sediments with a n excellent paleomagnetic record for high-resolution climate chang e studies of the previously sparsely sampled Pacific sector of the Wes t Antarctic margin.  

Despite the drilling success at these sites, the overall expeditio n experienced three unexpected difficulties that affected many of th e scientific objectives:  

1. The extensive sea ice on the continental shelf prevented us from drilling any of the proposed shelf sites.   
2. The drill sites on the continental rise were in the path of numerous icebergs of various sizes that frequently forced us to pause drilling or leave the hole entirely as they approached the ship. The overall downtime caused by approaching icebergs was $50\%$ of our time spent on site.   
3. A medical evacuation cut the expedition short by 1 week.  

Recovery of core on the continental rise at Sites U1532 an d U1533 cannot be used to indicate the extent of grounded ice on th e shelf or, thus, of its retreat directly. However, the sediments contained in these cores offer a range of clues about past WAIS exten t and retreat. At Sites U1532 and U1533, coarse-grained sediment s interpreted to be ice-rafted debris (IRD) were identified throughou t all recovered time periods. A dominant feature of the cores is recorded by lithofacies cyclicity, which is interpreted to represent relatively warmer periods variably characterized by sediments wit h higher microfossil abundance, greater bioturbation, and higher IR D concentrations alternating with colder periods characterized b y dominantly gray laminated terrigenous muds. Initial comparison o f these cycles to published late Quaternary records from the regio n suggests that the units interpreted to be records of warmer time intervals in the core tie to global interglacial periods and the units interpreted to be deposits of colder periods tie to global glacia l periods.  

Cores from the two drill sites recovered sediments of dominantly terrigenous origin intercalated or mixed with pelagic o r hemipelagic deposits. In particular, Site U1533, which is locate d near a deep-sea channel originating from the continental slope, contains graded silts, sands, and gravels transported downslop e from the shelf to the rise. The channel is likely the pathway of thes e sediments transported by turbidity currents and other gravitationa l downslope processes. The association of lithologic facies at bot h sites predominantly reflects the interplay of downslope and contouritic sediment supply with occasional input of more pelagic sediment. Despite the lack of cores from the shelf, our records from th e continental rise reveal the timing of glacial advances across the shel f and thus the existence of a continent-wide ice sheet in West Antarctica during longer time periods since at least the late Miocene.  

Cores from both sites contain abundant coarse-grained sediments and clasts of plutonic origin transported either by downslop e processes or by ice rafting. If detailed provenance studies confir m our preliminary assessment that the origin of these samples is fro m the plutonic bedrock of Marie Byrd Land, their thermochronological record will potentially reveal timing and rates of denudation an d erosion linked to crustal uplift. The chronostratigraphy of both site s enables the generation of a seismic sequence stratigraphy for the entire Amundsen Sea continental rise, spanning the area offshor e from the Amundsen Sea Embayment westward along the Mari e Byrd Land margin to the easternmost Ross Sea through a connecting network of seismic lines.  

# Introduction  

For decades, the drainage basins feeding ice into the Amundse n Sea have been considered the most vulnerable part of the mostl y marine based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) because of the grea t water depth at the grounding line, a subglacial bed deepening toward the interior of the continent, and the lack of substantial buttressing ice shelves (Hughes, 1981). Glaciers in this configuratio n are thought to be susceptible to rapid or runaway retreat (Schoof, 2007). Ice flowing into the Amundsen Sea Embayment is undergoing the most rapid changes of any sector of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, including substantial grounding line retreat over recent decades, a s observed from satellite data (e.g., Milillo et al., 2019). Recent model s suggest that a threshold leading to a (partial) collapse of the WAI S in this sector may have been passed already (Joughin et al., 2014 ) and that much of the ice sheet could be lost even under relativel y moderate greenhouse gas emission scenarios (DeConto and Pollard, 2016). Model projections are limited by a lack of constraints in several areas, most notably in a lack of detailed reconstructions of glacial history, which is only constrained for the time since the Las t Glacial Maximum (LGM; Larter et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2014).  

Drill cores from the Amundsen Sea (Figure F1) provide tests o f several key questions about controls on ice sheet stability. First, th e cores offer a direct record of glacial history in a drainage basin tha t receives ice only from the WAIS and thus allow clear comparison s between the WAIS history and low-latitude climate records. Mos t ice draining into the Amundsen Sea is grounded below sea level; thus, a complete and well-dated sedimentary record offshore ca n

provide a direct link between WAIS growth and decay and globa l climate and sea-level records, offering a test of the marine ice shee t instability.  Today,  warm  (modified)  Circumpolar  Deep  Wate r (CDW) impinges onto the Amundsen Sea shelf, which causes melting under ice shelves and at the grounding line in some places (Milillo  et  al.,  2019).  Reconstructions  of  past  CDW  intrusion s (Hillenbrand et al., 2017; Minzoni et al., 2017) can assess the ties between warm water and large-scale changes in past grounding-lin e positions. Carrying out these reconstructions offshore from th e drainage basin that currently has the largest negative mass balanc e of ice of anywhere in Antarctica (Paolo et al., 2015) is thus of prim e interest to future predictions. Finally, Expedition 379 is part of  a suite of International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) expeditions in the Antarctic that allow large-scale reconstructions an d comparisons between different drainage basins.  

# Background  

The fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel o n Climate Change (IPCC) (2007) already highlighted the fact that th e response of continental ice sheets to climatic changes and their contribution to global sea level change is the largest unknown variabl e in predicting future sea level change. The fifth assessment report o f the IPCC (2013) included more information about the likely contributions to sea level change from the Antarctic, but these contributions remain one of the primary unknowns in predictions of futur e change. Also, the 2013 IPCC assessment report emphasized that i f there is a substantial increase in the rate of sea level rise in the nex t century, it is likely to come from marine-based ice like that in th e Amundsen Sea Embayment. The recent Special Report on Globa l Warming of $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ of the IPCC (2018) concluded that marine ic e sheet instability in Antarctica and the irreversible loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet could be triggered by ${\sim}1.5^{\circ}$ to $2^{\circ}C$ of global warmin g and could result in multimeter sea level rise over hundreds to thousands of years.  

The WAIS rests on a subglacial bed that typically deepens toward the interior of the Antarctic continent as a continuation of th e fore-deepened continental shelf. Thus, the base of the ice is mostl y positioned below sea level (“marine based”), and the WAIS is sensitive to global sea level rise and regional oceanographic and atmospheric changes, so its history has been highly dynamic (e.g., Joughin and Alley, 2011). A complete WAIS collapse would raise th e global sea level by 3.3 to $4.3~\mathrm{m}$ (Fretwell et al., 2013), whereas th e collapse of its Amundsen Sea drainage sector would raise the se a level by ${\sim}1.5\,\mathrm{m}$ (Vaughan, 2008). Over the most recent decades, glaciers draining into the Amundsen Sea thinned at a rapid rate, thei r flow speed dramatically increased, and their grounding lines retreated significantly, thereby contributing to present sea level rise a t a faster rate than from any other glacier on Earth (e.g., Joughin an d Alley, 2011; Joughin et al., 2012; Paolo et al., 2015; Rignot et al., 2019).  

The present ice loss in the Amundsen Sea region is mainly attributed to sub–ice shelf melting induced by relatively warm CD W upwelling onto the shelf and spreading through deep bathymetri c troughs toward the grounding zones (e.g., Arneborg et al., 2012; Joughin et al., 2012). It is unclear, however, whether the current ic e loss results from recent climatic/oceanographic warming or recen t internal ice sheet dynamics (Joughin and Alley, 2011; Joughin et al., 2012). If the WAIS has undergone similar thinning and retreat i n the past, the factors driving that retreat can be compared to moder n conditions.  

The reconstruction and quantification of WAIS collapse durin g the Neogene and Quaternary will provide constraints for ice shee t models (Figure F2) that predict future WAIS behavior and resultin g sea level rise. Numerous modeling studies have tried to link th e waxing and waning of the WAIS to various forcing mechanism s (e.g., Pollard and DeConto, 2009; Holden et al., 2010; DeConto an d Pollard, 2016; Sutter et al., 2016). However, large uncertainties exis t regarding the spatial and temporal variability of past ice sheet advance and retreat. These uncertainties are mainly caused by the lac k of data from cores drilled proximal to the WAIS. The only existin g drill cores along the Pacific Antarctic margin outside the Ross Se a are from Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 35 in the Bellingshausen Sea (Hollister and Craddock, 1976) and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 178 on the Antarctic Peninsula margin (Barker an d Camerlenghi, 2002). Results from Leg 178 Site 1097, drilled on th e shelf, revealed a late Miocene age for the significant change in sequence geometry on the outer shelf that may indicate a change i n the typical extent of glacial advances, the dynamic behavior of ic e streams, or glacial sediment transport (Barker and Camerlenghi, 2002; Bart et al., 2005; Larter et al., 1997). Scheuer et al. (2006a, 2006b) were able to correlate seismic horizons on the western Antarctic Peninsula continental rise, which had been targeted by Le g 178 Sites 1095 and 1096 and were interpreted as transitions fro m preglacial to intermediate- and full-glacial conditions, from th e eastern Bellingshausen Sea to the Amundsen Sea.

Figure F2. Antarctic ice sheet models for the Pliocene (modified from DeConto and Pollard, 2016) and the Last Interglacial (modified from Sutter et al., 2016 ) simulating the collapse of the WAIS in each of these two warm times. Major ice retreat in the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) seems to be a precursor fo r partial or total WAIS collapse.  

The most detailed results on Neogene WAIS history stem fro m the Antarctic Drilling Project (ANDRILL) in the western Ross Sea, which recovered early Miocene $\left({\sim}20\,\mathrm{{Ma}}\right)$ to Quaternary sequence s in Cores AND-1B (Naish et al., 2009) and AND-2A (Passchier et al., 2011). Pliocene data from Core AND-1B indicate that orbitally induced  oscillations  of  the  WAIS  resulted  in  transitions  fro m grounded ice or ice shelves to open-water conditions (Naish et al., 2009; McKay et al., 2012). However, previous seismic stratigraphi c work on the Ross Sea shelf beyond Site AND-1B revealed only seve n shelf-wide grounding events (Alonso et al., 1992). Given the location of Site AND-1B, which is in a position to be overridden by bot h the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) and the WAIS, the ANDRIL L results are probably not representative of the WAIS outlets in th e Amundsen, Bellingshausen, and Weddell Seas. Sedimentary record s from the Ross and Weddell Seas provide only an integrated archiv e of WAIS and EAIS dynamics, whereas records from the Amundse n Sea will provide an unambiguous WAIS signal. We expect that results from recent IODP Expedition 374 to the Ross Sea shelf an d slope will provide further insight into the WAIS dynamics for th e Ross Sea sector (McKay et al., 2019). Although both the Ross Ic e Shelf and the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea extend fa r south, making positions proximal to the WAIS grounding-line difficult to access by drilling, only small and narrow ice shelves exist i n the Amundsen Sea Embayment today.  

# Oceanographic setting  

Persistent sea ice cover characterizes Pine Island Bay and th e wider Amundsen Sea Embayment (e.g., Jacobs et al., 2012), and although sea ice cover has decreased significantly in recent decade s (Parkinson and Cavalieri, 2012), 2018 and 2019 did not follow thi s trend; the sea ice cover of the Amundsen Sea was extensive throughout the entire austral summer and fall. Very little data on tidal ranges exist for the Amundsen Sea, but models suggest a $40\,\mathrm{cm}$ tidal height, making the area microtidal (Padman et al., 2002). Wate r mass temperatures within Pine Island Bay typically range betwee n $-1.5^{\circ}$ and $0^{\circ}C$ . The exception to this is warm CDW, which can reac h temperatures of $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , that impinges onto the shelf through dee p glacially carved troughs (Walker et al., 2007; Jacobs et al., 2011, 2013) and reaches the inner shelf in Pine Island Bay and offshor e from the Dotson and westernmost Getz ice shelves (Jacobs et al., 2011, 2013) as well as, at times, smaller bays and fjords along th e eastern coast of the Amundsen Sea Embayment (Minzoni et al., 2017). Productivity in polynyas in the Amundsen Sea is among th e highest in the Southern Ocean and includes phytoplankton bloom s (Arrigo et al., 2008, 2015; Minzoni et al., 2017). CDW-induced subice shelf melting is widely considered to be the primary external driver of contemporary glacier retreat in the Amundsen Sea, and recent work has shown that it can vary on seasonal (Kim et al., 2017 ) to decadal (Thoma et al., 2008; Dutrieux et al., 2014; Jenkins et al., 2016) timescales in response to wind stress at the continental shel f edge.  

# Geological setting  

Together, ice sheet dynamics and tectonic and other geologi c processes have shaped the Amundsen Sea continental shelf and rise. A $500{-}700~\mathrm{m}$ deep shelf is incised by two major paleo–ice strea m troughs, Pine Island Trough in the eastern Amundsen Sea Embayment and Dotson-Getz Trough in the western Amundsen Sea Embayment, whose tributaries originate from ice streams/glaciers o n the innermost ultradeep (as deep as 1600 meters below sea level ) shelf and converge at the transition from the inner to middle shel f (Lowe and Anderson, 2002; Larter et al., 2009; Graham et al., 2009, 2010). Both troughs extend toward the outer shelf, thereby becoming shallower and wider. The shelf geometry consists of a large pre - and synrift basin on the midshelf between the basement croppin g out on the inner shelf and the buried basement highs on the oute r shelf (Lowe and Anderson, 2002; Hochmuth and Gohl, 2013; Gohl et al., 2013b). A subordinate basin within the large midshelf basi n may be associated with motion along an early West Antarctic Rif t System branch. At least $4\,\mathrm{km}$ of preglacial strata were eroded by ic e from the present inner shelf and coastal hinterland. At least five major erosional unconformities indicate phases of significant WAI S advances (Gohl et al., 2013b). Prograding sequences and subglacial bedforms on the outer shelf, subglacial tills recovered in cores, an d radiocarbon dates on calcareous microfossils and organic matter i n overlying sediments indicate that ground ice expanded to the oute r shelf during the LGM and earlier glacial periods (Larter et al., 2014).  

The continental rise is dominated by thick sedimentary deposition centers and by sediment drifts, both of which indicate stron g bottom-current activity. Seismic data analyses from the Amundse n Sea rise suggest that sediment drift formation began in the Eocene/Oligocene (Uenzelmann-Neben and Gohl, 2012, 2014) (Figur e F3). This implies bottom-current activity and hence a cold climat e for the late Paleogene in the area that today probably lies under th e influence of Antarctic Bottom Water originating in the Ross Sea. Seismic records from the continental rise along the entire Mari e Byrd Land margin mark the base of the sediment drifts throughou t the Amundsen Sea and into the Ross Sea (Lindeque et al., 2016a, 2016b). These records provide insight into sedimentation processe s from preglacial to glacial times, variations in bottom-water circulation, early ice sheet growth, and glacial intensification toward th e present icehouse regime (Uenzelmann-Neben and Gohl, 2012, 2014). However, stratigraphic age estimates are derived from longdistance seismic correlation with the western Antarctic Peninsul a margin and the Ross Sea margin, and they hamper this insight.  

Seismic records from the Amundsen Sea shelf show dippin g strata on the midshelf that are possibly of Cretaceous to Miocen e age and buried by aggradational, less consolidated strata of presumed Pliocene–Pleistocene age (Lowe and Anderson, 2002; Gohl et al., 2013b). Preliminary results from a seabed drilling expeditio n place constraints on the Cretaceous sequences that overlie outcropping bedrock on the middle and inner shelf in Pine Island Troug h (Gohl et al., 2017). Since the mid-Miocene, the outer shelf and slop e have undergone first progradational and then aggradational deposition (Nitsche et al., 1997; Hochmuth and Gohl, 2013; Gohl et al., 2013b). Several unconformities that possibly indicate phases of subglacial erosion and ice advance separate the dipping strata. Although most of the inner Amundsen Sea shelf is void of significan t sedimentary cover (Lowe and Anderson, 2003; Graham et al., 2009; Gohl et al., 2013a, 2013b), a few small, shallow sediment basins li e along its eastern border (Uenzelmann-Neben et al., 2007) and i n front of Pine Island Glacier (Nitsche et al., 2013; Muto et al., 2016).

A bathymetric and structural high (Nitsche et al., 2007; Gohl e t al., 2013b) separates the eastern and western Amundsen Sea continental shelves. Oceanward-dipping midshelf strata north of the outcropping basement are evident in seismic data from the DotsonGetz Trough (Wellner et al., 2001; Graham et al., 2009; Weigelt e t al., 2009; Gohl et al., 2013b) and exhibit alternating sequences o f low and high reflectivity that are interpreted to be Miocene episodes of ice sheet advance and retreat. The glacial sequence stratigraphic model by Powell and Cooper (2002) proposed that glacia l advances develop morainal banks consisting of unstratified diamicton, sand, and gravel that lead to a chaotic or semitransparent seismic reflection pattern. In contrast, stratified muds are deposite d during a glacial retreat, which is expressed in seismic profiles as  a succession of closely spaced continuous reflectors. Boundaries between the acoustic units are sharp, but without drilling, the timin g of ice sheet oscillations remains unconstrained. Similar seismic facies occur on the Ross Sea and Antarctic Peninsula shelves, wher e drill cores confirmed that the chaotic/transparent units correspon d to massive diamicton and acoustically stratified seismic facies correspond to distal glaciomarine sediments (Anderson and Bartek, 1992; Bart and Anderson, 2000; Eyles et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2010; Anderson et al., 2011).  

The current seismostratigraphic model of the Amundsen Se a shelf was developed by long-distance correlation of seismic dat a with those of the Ross Sea shelf, which show striking similaritie s (Gohl et al., 2013b). Adopting the ages of the seismostratigraphi c units and unconformities on the Ross Sea shelf, which are relativel y well constrained by DSDP Leg 28 and ANDRILL records (e.g., D e Santis et al., 1999; McKay et al., 2009), the shelf-basin formatio n model for the Amundsen Sea shows development from a Cretaceous synrift basin to glacially dominated strata in the Neogene an d Quaternary (Gohl et al., 2013b). The seismostratigraphic recor d from the continental shelf is consistent with records from the Ros s Sea (Bartek et al., 1991; Chow and Bart, 2003) and James Ross Basi n in the northwestern Weddell Sea (Smith and Anderson, 2010), indicating a Miocene intensification of glaciation (De Santis et al., 1997 ) in accordance with findings from Core AND-2A (Warny et al., 2009; Passchier et al., 2011) and the Shallow Scientific Drilling on th e Antarctic Continental Margin (SHALDRIL)-II drill cores (Anderson et al., 2011; Anderson and Wellner, 2011).  

Apart from ice sheet dynamics inferred from the geometries an d acoustic facies of seismic reflections, the ice-drainage pattern in th e Amundsen Sea at the LGM and its substrate control were investigated by the analysis of sub- and proglacial bedforms visible i n swath bathymetry surveys and acoustic subbottom profiler dat a (e.g., Larter et al., 2009). The subglacial bedforms on the shelf indicate that grounded ice expanded to the outer shelf or even the shel f edge during the recent past (Wellner et al., 2001; Lowe and Anderson, 2002; Graham et al., 2009, 2010; Jakobsson et al., 2012; Nitsch e et al., 2013). Analysis of subglacial and glaciomarine sediments recovered in cores from the continental shelf confirmed an LGM ag e for the last WAIS advance, allowed a reconstruction of its retrea t history (Lowe and Anderson, 2002; Smith et al., 2011, 2014; Kirshner et al., 2012; Hillenbrand et al., 2013; Larter et al., 2014; Klages e t al., 2017), and indicated dynamically evolving drainage system s (Ehrmann et al., 2011). Recently, studies of benthic foraminiferal assemblages (Minzoni et al., 2017) and the chemical composition (i.e., stable carbon isotopes and magnesium/calcium ratios) of benthi c and planktonic foraminifer shells in ice-proximal marine sediment s from the inner shelf (Hillenbrand et al., 2017) showed that variabl e inflow of CDW was the primary driver for grounding-line retrea t along the coast of the Amundsen Sea Embayment throughout th e Holocene and since the 1940s. Sedimentary sequences from th e Amundsen Sea continental slope and rise spanning glacial–interglacial cycles to 1.8 Ma were investigated by multiproxy analyses t o find evidence for or against a WAIS collapse during the Quaternar y (Hillenbrand et al., 2002, 2009; Konfirst et al., 2012), as was previously suggested (e.g., Scherer et al., 1998; Scherer, 2003). One o f these studies found a mid-Pleistocene depositional anomaly tha t may indicate a WAIS collapse between 621 and 478 ky ago (Hillenbrand et al., 2009). All of these studies provide a robust sedimentological framework for interpreting drill cores.  

# Objectives  

The scientific goals and plan for this expedition are built on fiv e hypotheses about WAIS dynamics and related paleoenvironmenta l and paleoclimatic conditions.  

1. Hypothesis $H\!I$ : the WAIS responded to atmospheric and oceanic warming by a major retreat from the shelf or by even partial to full collapse.  

Ice sheet models hypothesize that past climate warming cause d significant deglaciation of the WAIS (e.g., DeConto and Pollard, 2016). For instance, during the early middle Pliocene, Earth’s climate was ${\sim}3^{\circ}C$ warmer than at present (e.g., Haywood et al., 2009 ) and thus as warm as predicted for the end of this century; atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ was ${\sim}400~\mathrm{ppm}$ , and other climatic boundary conditions were similar to the present (Pagani et al., 2010). The reason s for such a high atmospheric temperature during a time with modes t greenhouse-gas forcing are still unknown. Results from Core AND1B suggest repeated WAIS collapses during warm early middle Pliocene and Pleistocene interglacials (e.g., during Marine Isotope Stag e [MIS] 31) (Naish et al., 2009; Pollard and DeConto, 2009; McKay e t al., 2012; Villa et al., 2012). The hypothesis of WAIS collapses need s confirmation with a less ambiguous record from an outlet drainag e basin exclusively affected by the WAIS. In drill cores from th e Amundsen Sea margin, WAIS collapses would be recognizable b y biogenic sedimentary sequences deposited during times with permanent open-water conditions and reduced supply of glaciogeni c debris from the West Antarctic hinterland similar to those documented in the Core AND-1B record (Naish et al., 2009). Such sediments would contain abundant microfossils and probably tephr a layers from the Marie Byrd Land volcanic province (e.g., Le Masurier and Rex, 1991; Wilch et al., 1999; Hillenbrand et al., 2008), whic h are essential for dating the sediments and reconstructing paleoenvironmental conditions in the region. Thus, the cores will help t o answer the crucial question: did the WAIS collapse during the Neogene and Quaternary, as previously suggested, and if yes, when an d under which environmental conditions?  

2. Hypothesis $H2$ : ice-proximal records of ice sheet dynamics in the Amundsen Sea correlate with global records of ice-volume changes and proxy records for atmospheric and ocean temperatures.  

The post-LGM retreat of the WAIS from the Amundsen Se a shelf was episodic (e.g., Lowe and Anderson, 2002; Graham et al., 2009, 2010; Jakobsson et al., 2012; Larter et al., 2014). The retrea t episodes were likely triggered by different processes including se a level rise, sub–ice shelf erosion by warm deepwater advection, destabilization of the ice sheet by subglacial meltwater outbursts, an d grounding-line retreat into overdeepened inner-shelf basins (Jakobsson et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2011, 2014; Kirshner et al., 2012; Hillenbrand et al., 2013, 2017). These observations raise question s concerning the linkage between climate and glaciological forcing i n regulating WAIS deglaciation. Throughout the Cenozoic era, unexplained discrepancies are observed between Earth’s temperatur e and global ice volume reconstructed from proxies in deep-sea sediments, climate models, sea level estimates, and ice cores for the las t $800\;\mathrm{ky}$ . Reexamination of previously studied cores highlights ongoing uncertainty about the timing and extent of early ice shee t growth (Carter et al., 2017). The results of the Core AND-1B recor d (Naish et al., 2009) and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 318 to the Wilkes Land margin (Cook et al., 2013) reignited th e debate as to whether the Antarctic ice sheets underwent major collapses during Pliocene interglacials. Such collapses are neither directly recognizable from oxygen isotope proxies at far-field sites no r confirmed by the apparently persistent glaciation of the Antarcti c Peninsula since the latest Miocene (Smellie et al., 2009). Furthermore, evidence of repeated Pliocene ice sheet advances across th e shelf are observed in seismic profiles all along the Antarctic margi n (e.g., Larter et al., 1997; Nitsche et al., 1997; Bart and Anderson, 2000; Smith and Anderson, 2010; Bart, 2001). Indeed, results fro m SHALDRIL cores and other data from the eastern Antarctic Peninsula shelf indicate gradual cooling and an associated decline in vegetation over the past 37 My culminating in early Pliocene ice shee t expansion onto the continental shelf (Anderson et al., 2011). Result s from Leg 178 cores from the western Antarctic Peninsula shelf an d rise are consistent with repeated ice sheet advances throughout th e Pliocene (Eyles et al., 2001; Hillenbrand and Ehrmann, 2005; Hep p et al., 2006; Bart, 2001) but also indicate significant oceanic warming during Pliocene interglacials (Hillenbrand and Cortese, 2006; Escutia et al., 2009; Hepp et al., 2009; Bart and Iwai, 2012). Expedition 379 drill sites will help us decipher whether the WAIS responded directly to the orbitally paced climatic cycles of th e Pliocene and Quaternary or varied at periods determined by its internal dynamics, as findings from Leg 178 suggest for the Antarcti c Peninsula Ice Sheet (Barker and Camerlenghi, 2002). Similar t o cores from the Ross Sea shelf (McKay et al., 2009), Leg 178 core s from the Antarctic Peninsula shelf are incomplete because of glacial erosional unconformities (Eyles et al., 2001). During Expeditio n 379, cores were drilled from deep-sea drifts on the continental ris e offshore from the Amundsen Sea Embayment to obtain complet e sedimentary sequences. Similar drift sediments drilled on the western Antarctic Peninsula continental rise during Leg 178 provide d excellent archives of Neogene to Quaternary ice sheet dynamics an d paleoenvironmental changes (e.g., Hillenbrand and Ehrmann, 2005; Cowan et al., 2008; Hepp et al., 2006, 2009; Escutia et al., 2009; Bar t and Iwai, 2012). A comparable potential has already been demonstrated for Pleistocene drift sediments recovered from the Amundsen Sea continental rise (Hillenbrand et al., 2009).  

3. Hypothesis H3: the stability of marine-based WAIS margins is and has been controlled by warm deepwater incursions onto the shelf.  

In model experiments, incursions of relatively warm CDW ont o the West Antarctic continental shelf have been implicated in regulating WAIS behavior on orbital and suborbital timescales (Pollar d and De Conto, 2009; Dutrieux et al., 2014). Therefore, records o f past CDW upwelling are urgently needed to understand the relationship between WAIS dynamics and ocean circulation. Generating proxy records of past CDW incursions from marine sedimen t cores is still a challenge but was recently demonstrated to be possible in sediments from the Amundsen Sea Embayment shelf (Hillenbrand et al., 2017; Minzoni et al., 2017). With recent observations o f present CDW advection predominantly through the paleo–ic e stream troughs of the Amundsen Sea (e.g., Arneborg et al., 2012), drill cores from the continental shelf would provide sample material suitable for applying benthic foraminifer–based and other proxies t o reconstruct past CDW upwelling onto the shelf and its effect o n WAIS dynamics. However, proxy investigations on sediment records from the continental rise will also provide insights on deepwater circulation and CDW advection toward the Amundsen Sea shelf.  

4. Hypothesis H4: major WAIS advances onto the middle and outer shelf have occurred since the middle Miocene.  

Seismic data revealed progradational and aggradational deposition on the outer shelf and slope of the Amundsen Sea, probabl y since the mid-Miocene (e.g., Nitsche et al., 1997, 2000; Hochmut h and Gohl, 2013; Gohl et al., 2013b). Numerous unconformitie s within strata on the shelf document frequent advance and retreat o f grounded ice from the late Miocene until the Pliocene/Pleistocene, according to the stratigraphic age model by Gohl et al. (2013b). Th e preservation of buried grounding-zone wedges in the Pliocene– Pleistocene sequence on the outer Amundsen Sea shelf is consisten t with the prolonged continuous accumulation of marine and glaciomarine sediments in an open-marine setting, probably during  a long interglacial period with a significantly reduced WAIS, as observed on the Ross Sea shelf during the early Pliocene. However, th e models of grounded-ice advance and retreat across the Amundse n Sea shelf are based on long-distance correlations of seismic facie s and characteristics, which are tested by core data to constrain pas t WAIS extent.  

5. Hypothesis H5: the first WAIS advance onto the inner Amundsen Sea continental shelf occurred during the Oligocene and was related to the uplift of Marie Byrd Land.  

The onset of major glaciation in West Antarctica is still no t dated because of sparse drill cores. Records of ice-rafted debri s (IRD) suggest that glaciers must have reached the coast of the Ros s Sea in the early to mid-Oligocene (Miller et al., 2008). Ice shee t models (e.g., DeConto and Pollard, 2003) reconstructed an earl y WAIS nucleus in the mountain chain extending from elevated Marie Byrd Land over the Ellsworth Mountains to the southern Antarctic Peninsula. The exhumation and erosion history of Marie Byr d Land and especially the Marie Byrd Land dome is essential for th e interrelations between ice sheet and lithosphere dynamics (e.g., Rocchi et al., 2006; Wilson and Luyendyk, 2009; Wilson et al., 2012, 2013; Spiegel et al., 2016) because (1) exhumation and erosio n change topography, which in turn influences glacier movements b y slope steepness; (2) exhumation is often associated with surface uplift, and high altitude favors formation of glaciers; and (3) glaciatio n changes erosion rates and, because of isostatic adjustment, exhumation rates. This relationship can be investigated using detailed provenance and thermochronological analyses of IRD from Neogen e drill samples and existing rock samples from the hinterland.  

# Operations plan/drilling strategy  

The primary aim of our drilling campaign was to obtain cor e and log data from seaward-dipping strata along a transect from th e  

Paleogene sequences close to the boundary with bedrock on the inner shelf to the Pliocene to Pleistocene sequences on the outer shel f and continuing onto the continental rise for continuous high-resolution records. Because sea ice conditions during the drilling expedition were unsuitable for accessing either the priority sites in Pin e Island Trough or the transect targeting strata of comparable age an d cross-shelf position in the Dotson-Getz Trough, we drilled ou r third-tier priority sites on the continental rise. The sites we drille d during Expedition 379 were added to the proposal following the record austral summer sea ice extent in 2017/2018. The two site s (U1532 and U1533) were not lower in priority than other rise sites; instead, they were added to the proposal in 2018, when sites were n o longer required to be on a crossing seismic line. This change provided an opportunity for alternates even farther north and thus farther from likely sea ice cover than the originally proposed sites. Additional modifications in 2018 to our original proposal include d approval of “ribbons” along the seismic line that allowed holes to b e drilled in a range of positions and for maximum flexibility in sever e ice conditions.  

Our plan was to core two holes at each drill site using the advanced piston corer (APC), half-length APC (HLAPC), and extended core barrel (XCB) systems in the first hole and the rotar y core barrel (RCB) system in the second hole and then collect lo g data in the deeper RCB hole. In reality, each of our two drill site s included far more holes than intended. Site U1532 includes seve n holes, and Site U1533 has four holes. No holes were terminated b y reaching target depths; we terminated the first 10 holes because o f approaching icebergs, and we had to abandon the final hole becaus e of an emergency medical evacuation.  

The coring strategy at each site generally followed the operational plans; however, it was spread out over multiple holes. Whe n we were forced to leave a hole, we drilled a new hole without corin g through the upper section, and then coring resumed with som e overlap. We initiated new holes following a standard offset of $20\;\mathrm{m}$ except when ice conditions would not allow a new hole close to th e original site and other positions along the permitted ribbon wer e open. Thus, the holes at each site are more spread out than those o f many other IODP expeditions.  

Although downhole logging was planned for each site, no downhole log data were collected during Expedition 379 because of th e premature termination of each hole.  

# Site summaries Site U1532  

# Background  

Site U1532 (Proposed Site ASRE-08A) is located on the wester n upper flank of a large sediment drift (Resolution Drift) on the continental rise, $270~\mathrm{km}$ north of the Amundsen Sea Embayment shel f edge (Figures F1, F4). This drill site was chosen as the first Expedition 379 site upon arriving in the Amundsen Sea because the sea ic e distribution did not allow drilling at any of the other primary or alternate sites at that time. The Resolution Drift belongs to a syste m of five parallel sediment drifts on this rise that are characterized b y gentle western and steep eastern flanks. Sediment drifts are commonly formed by deposition of suspended sediments transporte d by ocean-bottom contour currents. Deep-sea channels that originate at the foot of the continental slope and reach far into the abyssal plain separate the sediment drifts in the Amundsen Sea. Sediment is transported downslope through these channels by turbidity currents, slumps, and other gravity-driven processes tha t supply a large portion of the detritus deposited on the drifts (Nitsche et al., 2000; Dowdeswell et al., 2006). Sedimentation rates o f drift deposits along the Antarctic margin are extremely high, whic h makes them high-priority drill targets to obtain continuous paleoceanographic and paleo–ice sheet records of high temporal resolution (e.g., Barker and Camerlenghi, 2002; Uenzelmann-Neben an d Gohl, 2012). Stratigraphic interpretations of seismic lines across th e sediment drifts of the Amundsen Sea (e.g., Nitsche et al., 2000; Scheuer et al., 2006b; Uenzelmann-Neben and Gohl, 2012, 2014 ) are, so far, only inferred from long-distance correlation with drif t deposits on the Antarctic Peninsula rise, for which age constraint s from drill core exist (Leg 178; e.g., Acton et al., 2002). However, th e interpretations suggest equally high sedimentation rates for th e Pleistocene, Pliocene, and upper Miocene.

Figure F4. Site U1532 on the northwestern segment of Seismic Line AWI-20100130 that crosses the Resolution Drift. Seismic horizons at the bases of the Pleistocene and Pliocene were preliminarily identified from the core records. Estimated age of the horizon at the base of Unit ASR-II is from Uenzelmann-Neben an d Gohl (2014).   
Figure F5. Distribution of Holes U1532A–U1532G. See Figure F1 for regiona l location map.  

Seven holes (U1532A–U1532G) were drilled in $3962\mathrm{~m~}$ wate r depth (Figure F5). The deepest hole (U1532G) was drilled to $794\;\mathrm{m}$ . Overall core recovery was $90\%$ . Although sea ice was not a proble m for the R/V JOIDES Resolution at this site, icebergs of various sizes, from large tabular icebergs to smaller fragments and growlers, frequently approached the ship and were the primary reason for th e large number of holes. Holes U1532E and U1532F were nothin g more than unsuccessful attempts to start coring at depth before being forced to avoid another iceberg approach.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

Deposits at Site U1532 include silty clay(stone) with disperse d sand and gravel and variable biogenic content recovered from fiv e holes down to $787.4~\mathrm{m}$ . Six lithofacies were identified based on visual characteristics of the sediments combined with informatio n from smear slides and thin sections. Whole-core X-radiograph s aided in observations of sedimentary structures, clast occurrence, and drilling disturbance. The dominant lithofacies assemblages ar e planar thinly laminated silty clay(stone) with occasional occurrences of massive and bioturbated silty clay(stone) typically ${<}1.5\mathrm{~m~}$ thick. We observed dispersed sand grains, granules, and occasional pebbles throughout the assemblages, but they appear mainly concentrated within the massive and bioturbated facies. Minor lithofacies include foraminifer-rich and biosilica-rich mud to ooze.  

![](images/5bc4c8964e82f3997f35160ab8d708c31c26610107848739287ac340986970bb.jpg)  

We identified one lithostratigraphic unit with three subunit s based on changes in facies assemblages: Lithostratigraphic Subunit s IA $(0{-}92.6\,\mathrm{m};$ recent–Pliocene), IB $\!\!\langle92.6{-}400.6\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{m}};$ ; Pliocene), and I C $(401.0{-}787.4\;\mathrm{m}$ ; Pliocene–Miocene). The sediments are unconsolidated in the upper $150\ \mathrm{m}$ and become increasingly more consolidated below this depth. Intervals of carbonate-cemented lamina e and very thin beds of coarse siltstone and sandstone are present below $400\:\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Biostratigraphy  

In the upper part of the section recovered at Site U1532 (i.e., Subunit IA; $0{-}92.6\;\mathrm{m})$ ), sufficient microfossils for biostratigraphic age assignment were only present in the upper ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ , providing an age o f middle Pleistocene to recent $(0{-}0.6\,\mathrm{Ma})$ . Sediments between ${\sim}10$ an d ${\sim}90~\mathrm{m}$ were nearly barren of datable microfossils, whereas diatom s and radiolarians from ${\sim}92$ to $156\,\mathrm{m}$ provided biostratigraphic ages o f mid- to late Pliocene $(3.2{-}3.8\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , and sediments from ${\sim}156$ to 22 4 m were assigned an early Pliocene age of $3.8{-}4.4\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . The absence o f microfossils or only trace occurrences of highly fragmented and recrystallized siliceous microfossils in samples below ${\sim}224\mathrm{~m~}$ in Hol e U1532G precluded shipboard biostratigraphic age determination a t most levels. Exceptions include short intervals with poorly preserve d but identifiable diatoms between ${\sim}224$ and $332\,\mathrm{~m~}$ (early Pliocene; younger than $4.7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ) and between $\sim\!332$ and $510\,\mathrm{m}$ (early Pliocene t o near the Miocene/Pliocene boundary; younger than $5.5\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ).  

Some light green, bioturbated biosilica-rich intervals coincid e with higher concentrations of coarse sand and gravel, which are inferred to be IRD. Some stratigraphic intervals contain little or n o identifiable diatom debris despite possessing low magnetic susceptibility and gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density and a greenish color, which are characteristics typical of diatomaceous units. The lack of diatoms in these intervals is inferred to reflect, at least i n part, diagenetic loss of diatoms and other siliceous microfossils. Organic microfossils occur in relatively low abundance throughout th e Site U1532 sequence. A possibly in situ dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) assemblage of very low diversity and low abundance is presen t throughout the section, but this assemblage is more persistent an d thus very likely to be in situ below $591.77\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Calcareous microfossils including foraminifers, calcareous nannofossils, and ostracods generally occur in the absence of biosiliceous material in thi n intervals in the Pleistocene section.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The interpreted magnetic polarity at Site U1532 was correlate d with the Gradstein et al. (2012) geological timescale (GTS2012). The resulting key paleomagnetic data were then integrated wit h biostratigraphic data to produce an age model.  

For Hole U1532A, we obtained robust shipboard magnetostratigraphy that consists of four normal and four reversed polarity intervals. The Brunhes–Matuyama polarity transition $(0.781\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , th e termination and beginning of the Olduvai Subchron (1.778 an d $1.945\,\mathrm{\:Ma}$ , respectively), the Matuyama–Gauss polarity transitio n $(2.581\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , the termination and beginning of the Kaena Subchro n (C2An.1r; 3.032 and $3.116\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively), and the terminatio n and beginning of the Mammoth Subchron (C2An.2r; 3.207 an d $3.330\,\mathrm{\:Ma}$ , respectively) were identified. Paleomagnetic measurements for Hole U1532B identified the beginning of the Mammot h Subchron (C2An.2r; 3.330 Ma) and the Gauss–Gilbert polarit y transition  (3.596  Ma). Paleomagnetic  measurements for  Hol e U1532C identified the termination of the Nunivak Subchro n (C3n.2n; 4.493 Ma) but no clear Cochiti Subchron $(\mathrm{C}3\mathrm{n}.\mathrm{ln};4.187-$ $4.300\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ). Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) measurement s for Hole U1532G identified the beginning of the Nunivak Subchro n (C3n.2n; 4.631 Ma), the termination and beginning of the Sidufjal l Subchron (C3n.3n; 4.799 and $4.896~\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively), and the termination and beginning of the Thvera Subchron (C3n.4n; 4.997 an d $5.235~\mathrm{~Ma}$ , respectively). Reversed magnetic polarity continue s downcore to the bottom of Hole U1532G. The beginning of Chro n C3r $\left\langle6.033\;\mathrm{Ma}\right\rangle$ was not observed. Therefore, the oldest sediment s recovered at Site U1532 are presumably of late Miocene age.  

# Geochemistry  

At Site U1532, 65 interstitial water samples were collected an d measured for salinity, alkalinity, pH, major ions (sodium [Na], potassium [K], calcium [Ca], magnesium [Mg], chloride [Cl], and sulfate $[\mathrm{SO}_{4})]$ ), nutrients (ammonium $[\mathrm{NH}_{4}]$ and phosphate $\left[\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right])$ , silica $\left(\mathrm{H}_{4}\mathrm{Si}[\mathrm{OH}]_{4}\right)$ , and trace elements (strontium [Sr], lithium [Li], iron [Fe], manganese [Mn], boron [B], and barium [Ba]). Drillin g fluid contamination was detected in a few interstitial water sample s taken from XCB cores. Higher abundances of perfluorocarbo n tracer (PFT) in these samples are in line with this observation. Th e sulfate downhole profile shows a sharp linear decrease from $\mathrm{\sim}28$ mM near the surface to ${\sim}2.3\ \mathrm{mM}$ at ${\sim}664\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{{]}}}$ ; however, sulfate concentration did not reach zero at this site, indicating a low sulfate reduction rate. The $\mathrm{Ca}$ and $\scriptstyle\mathrm{Sr}$ profiles show an overall increase, whereas the K and $\mathrm{Mg}$ profiles display the reverse trend. Silica concentration is relatively high from 8.5 to $238\ \mathrm{m}$ , coinciding with intervals  where  a higher abundance  of diatoms was  observed. Diagenesis of diatoms through reaction with the interstitial wate r likely resulted in higher silica concentration.  

Calcium carbonate $\tt(C a C O_{3})$ content is low in the sediments o f Lithostratigraphic Subunit IA; discrete maxima in $C a C O_{3}$ observe d in the upper section of Subunit IA are linked to layers rich in calcareous foraminifer tests. Subunit IB is characterized by a general increase in $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ downhole. Total organic carbon (TOC) content i s generally low at Site U1532 but displays a small stepwise increas e from Subunit IA to Subunit IC. Total nitrogen content is lo w throughout  all  subunits.  Total  sulfur  (TS)  content  decrease s throughout Subunit IA and generally remains low throughout Subunit IB. TS displays a downhole increase in the uppermost sectio n of Subunit IC (to ${\sim}533\mathrm{~m}$ ). Below ${\sim}533\mathrm{~m~}$ , TS declines again an d then shifts to low values below ${\sim}670\mathrm{~m~}$ . This shift in TS content i s associated with a near depletion of interstitial water sulfate concentrations, which may limit sulfate reduction and the formation o f iron sulfides at greater depth.  

Headspace gas samples to monitor for the presence and abundance of $C_{1}-C_{3}$ hydrocarbons indicate that methane occurs in onl y very low concentrations throughout the upper ${\sim}650~\mathrm{m}$ . At ${\sim}667\mathrm{~m~}$ , methane concentration increases rapidly, exceeding 5000 ppmv below ${\sim}713\;\mathrm{m}$ and reaching a maximum of 9517 ppmv at ${\sim}771\,\mathrm{m}$ . Th e increase of methane at ${\sim}667~\mathrm{m}$ coincides with a pronounced minimum in sulfate, suggesting that methane may be of biogenic origi n at Site U1532.  

# Physical properties  

Collected physical property data include magnetic susceptibility, natural gamma radiation (NGR), GRA bulk density, discret e moisture and density (MAD), $P$ -wave velocity, thermal conductivity, in situ formation temperature (advanced piston corer temperatur e tool [APCT-3]), and spectral color reflectance. Whole-round magnetic susceptibility trends follow those observed in GRA bulk density and NGR, likely indicating changes in terrigenous sedimen t content. Magnetic susceptibility data were used as a primary tool for correlating cores from adjacent holes. Measured whole-roun d magnetic susceptibility ranges between $8\,\times\,10^{-5}$ and $241\times10^{-5}$ SI . Average magnetic susceptibility values increase downhole from ${\sim}80$ $\times\,10^{-5}$ to ${\sim}120\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ at ${\sim}93\ \mathrm{m},$ which corresponds to the Lithostratigraphic Subunit IA/IB boundary. Measured NGR ranges between 19 and 112 counts/s with an overall average of 69 counts/s. Average NGR values increase downhole from ${\sim}43$ counts/s at th e mudline to ${\sim}75$ counts/s at ${\sim}93\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{~}}$ , which corresponds to the Subunit IA/IB boundary. Below ${\sim}93\,\mathrm{~m~}_{\mathrm{~}}$ , magnetic susceptibility an d  

NGR vary cyclically between $\sim\!15\times10^{-5}$ and ${\sim}100\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ and ${\sim}30$ and 80 counts/s, respectively. In the upper $65\ \mathrm{m},$ bulk density increases downhole from ${\sim}1.5$ to ${\sim}1.8~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}},$ , followed by a mor e gradual increase to ${\sim}2.1~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ , reflecting increasing compaction. Intervals of lower magnetic susceptibility, NGR, and GRA bulk density correspond to greenish gray intervals in Subunits IB and IC. Sediment porosity decreases downhole from $77\%$ at the seafloor t o $58\%$ at $_{30\;\mathrm{m}}$ and decreases further with depth to $33\%$ at the botto m of Hole U1532G, reflecting the downward compaction trend of marine sediments. $P$ -wave velocity increases with depth from ${\sim}1460$ $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ at the seafloor to ${\sim}2090~\mathrm{m/s}$ at the base of Hole U1532G. N o major changes in $P$ -wave velocity were observed across the lithostratigraphic subunit boundaries. Thermal conductivity increase s with depth from ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{W/(m{\cdot}K)}$ at the seafloor to ${\sim}1.8~\mathrm{W/(m{\cdot}K)}$ a t ${\sim}390~\mathrm{m},$ , corresponding to a downhole increase in dry bulk densit y and decrease in porosity due to compaction. Formation temperature measurements from 34 to $150\;\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1532A were used t o estimate a geothermal gradient of ${\sim}54^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ .  

# Site U1533  

# Background  

Site U1533 (Proposed Site ASRE-09A) is located $62\,\mathrm{km}$ westsouthwest of Site U1532 on the westernmost lower flank of the Resolution Drift, the same sediment drift as Site U1532, on the continental rise of the Amundsen Sea (Figures F1, F6). This lower flan k is bound by a north–south oriented deep-sea channel west of Sit e U1533 (Uenzelmann-Neben and Gohl, 2012). The channel is likel y the path of sediment transported downslope from the shelf by turbidity currents and sediment gravity flows and, as such, is likely th e major source of terrigenous sediment to the drill site (e.g., Dowdeswell et al., 2006). Bottom currents transported clay- and silt-size d particles before they deposited them to form a drift (e.g., Nitsche e t al., 2000). A robust horizon correlation from Site U1532 performe d along three connected seismic lines indicates that sedimentary sequences of the same age are more condensed at Site U1533.  

Four holes (U1533A–U1533D) were drilled at Site U1533 in water depths between 4179 and $4184\;\mathrm{m}$ (Figure F7). The deepest penetration (Hole U1533B) reached $383\;\mathrm{m}$ with an overall core recover y of $70\%$ . As at Site U1532, frequent approaches of icebergs of variou s sizes were the primary reason for the large number of holes.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

Sediments recovered at Site U1533 consist mainly of silt y clay(stone) with varying biogenic content and amounts of bioturbation as well as rare occurrences of diamict and conglomerate. Thi n sand(stone) and silt(stone) beds and laminae occur throughout, an d intervals of carbonate cementation and volcaniclastic material wer e also observed. The recovered sediments are categorized into seve n lithofacies based on visual characteristics and lithologic information supported by smear slide observations. The drilled sequence i s divided into Lithostratigraphic Subunits IA $(0{-}54.9\,\mathrm{~m)}$ and I B $(54.9{-}381.2\,\mathrm{m})$ based on changes in facies assemblages. Whole-cor e X-radiographs were used to aid in the identification of sedimentar y structures, clast occurrence, and drilling disturbance. Site U1533 i s dominated by deposition of fine-grained sediments interpreted t o be initially supplied by sediment gravity flows from the continental shelf and subsequently reworked by contour currents. Silt and san d beds are interpreted to have been deposited by overspill of turbidit y currents from the submarine channel. Additionally, a significan t amount of biosiliceous material in the sediments is supplied fro m the overlying surface waters.  

The association of facies in Lithostratigraphic Subunit IA predominantly reflects the interplay of downslope and contouritic sediment supply that also includes input of more pelagic sedimen t during phases of seasonally open marine conditions. The amount o f biogenic material is generally high throughout Subunit IA, suggest

ing sustained periods of relatively high marine productivity. Deposits related to downslope transport are present throughout th e sedimentary record at Site U1533. In Subunits IA and IB, coarsegrained beds indicate that overspill deposition probably originate d from downslope transport through the adjacent deep-sea channel. Subunit IB has generally higher amounts of visible clasts and pebbles than Subunit IA. Dispersed granules and pebbles, clast nests, and discontinuous bands of coarse sand and granules in Subunits I A and IB are inferred to indicate persistent but likely low-intensity ic e rafting, and there is a higher abundance of this IRD within diato m ooze intervals.

In contrast with Site U1532, which contains significant interval s that are barren of microfossils, the majority of Site U1533 sample s from the mudline to the lowermost sediments contain siliceous microfossils with variable preservation and organic-walled microfossils, dominantly reworked terrestrial palynomorphs. Preservatio n and abundance of microfossils are highly variable, including som e barren intervals noted in the lowermost Pleistocene–uppermos t Pliocene and lower Pliocene sections. A similar general pattern o f alternating gray-beige to brownish sediments (Lithostratigraphi c Subunit IA) and gray-beige to greenish sediments (Subunit IB) a t Site U1532 was commonly observed at Site U1533. At Site U1533, they consisted of gray, laminated, microfossil-poor, mostly terrigenous mudstones punctuated by thinner brownish to greenish, bioturbated, variably biosilica-bearing intervals, some with sand- t o pebble-sized material interpreted to be IRD. Despite the proximit y to Site U1532, the brownish and greenish bioturbated units of Sit e U1533 have a significantly higher overall concentration of biosiliceous material.  

The diatom assemblages are heavily dominated by pelagic form s with little evidence of sea ice or neritic environments. We speculat e that the difference between Sites U1532 and U1533, with respect t o Pleistocene biosilica accumulation and preservation, is due to  a lower terrigenous flux and higher deposition of pelagic diatoms advected from farther offshore rather than a difference in local diato m production between the surface water at the sites.  

The upper ${\sim}40\;\mathrm{m}$ of Site U1533 spans the recent to Pleistocen e and contains variable concentrations of diatoms, radiolarians, an d foraminifers; rare marine and reworked terrestrial palynomorphs; and very rare calcareous nannofossils. Diatoms and radiolarians ar e present in most samples examined from this interval. Foraminifer s are present only in a few intervals in the upper ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of the sequence.  

Pleistocene to upper Miocene sediments recovered from Hol e U1533B are dated primarily by diatoms and radiolarians. Bot h groups are documented with variable abundance from the top to th e base of Hole U1533B. Samples from the lowermost cores generall y contain common to abundant diatoms, although the frustules ar e highly fragmented. Diatoms and radiolarians provide a latest Miocene age $(6.2{-}6.7\ \mathrm{Ma})$ for the lowermost sediments recovered fro m Hole U1533B. Combined with magnetostratigraphic constraints, the deepest sediments recovered in Hole U1533B are ${\sim}6.4–6.75\,\mathrm{Ma}$ In situ foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils were not observe d in the Pliocene sediments in Hole U1533B, whereas rare to commo n marine  and  reworked  terrestrial  palynomorphs  are  presen t throughout.  

# Paleomagnetism  

For Hole U1533A, demagnetization of NRM at $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ identifie s the Brunhes–Matuyama transition $(0.781\,\mathrm{Ma})$ , the termination an d beginning of the Jaramillo Subchron $(\mathsf{C l r.l n};\,0.988$ and $1.072\ \mathrm{Ma}_{\mathrm{:}}$ respectively), and the termination and beginning of the Cob b Mountain Subchron (C1r.2n; 1.173 and $1.185\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively).  

The magnetostratigraphy is more complex for Hole U1533 B than for Hole U1533A because of reduced core recovery and drilling disturbance of some intervals. The shipboard interpretatio n identifies the beginning of the Olduvai Subchron (C2n; 1.945 Ma), the termination and beginning of Subchron C2An.1n (2.581 an d $3.032\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively), the termination and beginning of Subchro n C2An.3n (3.330 and $3.596\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively), the termination an d beginning of the Cochiti Subchron $(\mathsf{C}3\mathsf{n}.\mathsf{l n};4.187$ and $4.300\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively), and the termination and beginning of the Nunivak Subchron  (C3n.2n;  4.493  and  4.631  Ma,  respectively).  Subchro n C2An.2n (3.116–3.207 Ma) might be present in a very condense d form in Core 379-U1533B-5H at ${\sim}58\mathrm{~m~}$ . Farther downhole, paleomagnetic measurements reveal the termination and beginning o f the Sidufjall Subchron (C3n.3n; 4.799 and $4.896~M{\mathrm{a}}$ , respectively ) and the termination and beginning of the Thvera Subchro n (C3n.4n; 4.997 and $5.235\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively). Below an interval without core recovery, the deepest cores with significant recovery, 39 R and 43R, are of mainly normal polarity, suggesting a basal age fo r Hole U1533B between the termination of Subchron C3An.1n (6.03 3 Ma) and the beginning of Subchron C3An.2n (6.733 Ma). Oscillating normal and reversed polarity at the bottom of Hole U1533 B provides no clear evidence that Subchron C3Ar was recovered.  

For Hole U1533C, no magnetic polarity reversal was recorded , suggesting that the recovered sediments are younger than the Brunhes–Matuyama transition $(0.781\,\mathrm{Ma})$ .  

For Hole U1533D, paleomagnetic measurements identified th e Brunhes–Matuyama transition $(0.781\,\,\mathrm{Ma})$ , the termination and beginning of the Jaramillo Subchron $(\mathsf{C}\mathrm{1r}.\mathrm{1n};0.988$ and $1.072\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively), the termination and beginning of the Cobb Mountai n Subchron (C1r.2n; 1.173 and $1.186\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively), and the termination and beginning of the Olduvai Subchron (C2n; 1.778 an d $1.945\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively).  

# Chronostratigraphy  

By combining biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy, the interval above ${\sim}37\;\mathrm{m}$ is assigned a recent to Pleistocene age, the interval from ${\sim}37$ to $265~\mathrm{m}$ is assigned a Pliocene age, and the interval from ${\sim}265$ to $383~\mathrm{m}$ (base of recovery at Site U1533) is assigned  a latest Miocene age. The combined data indicate a $6.4{-}6.75\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ag e for the base of Hole U1533B at $381.23~\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water salinity at Site U1533 is constant at 35 from th e seafloor to ${\sim}235\mathrm{~m~}$ and is slightly lower (33 to ${\sim}34$ ) from 255 to 37 5 m. Cl concentration ranges between 557 and $596~\mathrm{mM}$ . The elevate d  

Cl concentrations in the deeper section of Site U1533 could be du e to hydration reactions during clay formation. Na concentratio n ranges between 440 and $483~\mathrm{mM}$ throughout the section. Belo w ${\sim}17\ \mathrm{m},$ sulfate decreases continuously with depth and reaches it s minimum $(\sim\!1.6\;\mathrm{mM})$ at $375\;\mathrm{m}$ . Interstitial water alkalinity increase s linearly with depth from $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ to a maximum $({\sim}10.5~\mathrm{mM})$ at $\mathord{\sim}185$ m, which is the opposite trend to that of sulfate. Below ${\sim}185\mathrm{~m~}$ , alkalinity slightly decreases with depth to $375\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Sr concentration shows an overall increase from $82\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ to $196~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at $375\textrm{m}$ , reaching maximum values ${\sim}2.5$ times highe r than the measured modern seawater value $(82\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$ . The higher S r concentration indicates either higher fluid-rock reaction with volcaniclastic material or dissolution of carbonates.  

Methane concentration is ${\sim}4$ ppmv, which is close to the instrumental background signal, in Hole U1533A and most of Hol e U1533B. At $325.60\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , methane concentration abruptly increase s downhole to a peak of 6373 ppmv at $375.02\mathrm{~m~}$ . No hydrocarbon s other than methane were detected at Site U1533. Increased methane was found only at the base of Lithostratigraphic Subunit IB, where the lowest sulfate concentration was observed. Together wit h the absence of higher hydrocarbons, this may suggest a biologica l source of methane at Site U1533.  

Total carbon content varies between 0.02 and $0.5~\mathrm{wt\%}$ and increases with depth. $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ is low at Site U1533 and ranges betwee n 0.02 and $2.54\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . TOC content varies between 0.01 and $0.41~\mathrm{wt\%}$ and is similar to the total carbon record in terms of trends an d abundances, indicating that organic carbon constitutes most of th e total carbon pool.  

Samples for contamination testing were collected from the exterior and center of freshly exposed core sections or whole-roun d samples. PFTs were present in variable concentrations in sample s taken from most APC core exteriors because of the direct exposur e of the core surface to circulating drilling fluids. However, trace r concentrations are approximately four orders of magnitude lower i n these samples than the target concentrations of tracers in the drilling fluid. Tracers were below detection in the interior of most AP C and HLAPC cores. The absence of tracers in the central parts o f most APC/HLAPC cores and their generally low presence in cor e exteriors suggest low overall contamination. XCB cores generall y show low contamination in both the interior and exterior samples, but in contrast to APC/HLAPC cores, contamination was consistently present in the center of the cores. The sampled RCB core s generally  showed  higher  levels  of  tracer  contamination  tha n APC/HLAPC and XCB cores.  

# Physical properties  

Collected physical property data include magnetic susceptibility, NGR, GRA bulk density, MAD, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity, thermal conductivity, and spectral color reflectance. Whole-round magneti c susceptibility trends follow those observed in GRA bulk density an d NGR, likely indicating changes in terrigenous sediment content. Magnetic susceptibility data were used as a primary tool for correlating cores from adjacent holes to create a shipboard splice fo r the uppermost ${\sim}44~\mathrm{m}$ of the site. Measured whole-round magneti c susceptibility ranges between $5\,\times\,10^{-5}$ and $805\,\times\,10^{-5}\,\,\mathrm{SI}.$ . Averag e magnetic susceptibility values increase downhole from $\sim\!50\times10^{-5}$ to ${\sim}100\,\times\,10^{-5}\,\mathrm{~SI~}$ at $55\,\textrm{m}$ , which corresponds to the Lithostratigraphic Subunit IA/IB boundary. Measured NGR ranges betwee n 13 and 235 counts/s with an overall average of 56 counts/s. Averag e NGR values increase downhole from $\mathord{\sim}20$ counts/s at the mudline t o ${\sim}60$ counts/s at $55\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , which corresponds to the Subunit IA/I B boundary. Below ${\sim}55\mathrm{~m}$ , magnetic susceptibility and NGR vary cyclically between ${\sim}10\,\times\,10^{-5}$ and ${\sim}130\,\times\,10^{-5}\,\,\mathrm{SI}$ and ${\sim}30$ and ${\sim}75$ counts/s, respectively. The GRA bulk density record shows a shar p downhole increase from ${\sim}1.3$ to ${\sim}1.8~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in the uppermost $55~\mathrm{m}$ that corresponds to Subunit IA. Below this depth, GRA bulk densit y exhibits several stepwise changes. The overall increase in GRA bul k density with depth at this site reflects the increasing compaction o f sediment with depth. Smaller scale variability indicates changes i n sediment lithology and correlates well with NGR and magnetic susceptibility variability. In the upper $\mathord{\sim}15\;\mathrm{m}$ of Holes U1533A, U1533 C and U1533D, magnetic susceptibility, NGR, and GRA bulk densit y exhibit a “sawtooth” pattern with a sharp increase in overall valu e followed by a more gradual decline downcore.  

Sediment porosity decreases downhole from $86\%$ at the seafloo r to $65\%$ at ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{m}$ and decreases further with depth to $45\%$ at the bottom of Hole U1533B, reflecting the downward compaction trend o f marine sediments. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity increases from ${\sim}1480\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ at th e seafloor to an average velocity of ${\sim}1760~\mathrm{m/s}$ at the termination o f Hole U1533B at $380\;\mathrm{m}$ . Below ${\sim}55\mathrm{~m~}$ in Lithostratigraphic Subuni t IB, $P$ -wave velocity varies with sediment texture. Thermal conductivity increases with depth from ${\sim}0.7\ \mathrm{W/(m{\cdot}K)}$ at the seafloor t o ${\sim}1.4\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ at ${\sim}375\,\mathrm{m}$ and corresponds to a downhole increase i n dry bulk density and decrease in porosity from compaction.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

# Operational considerations related to the science objectives  

Expedition 379 accomplished drilling and coring at two ver y successful sites on the continental rise of the Amundsen Sea. Drilling at Site U1532 on a large sediment drift (Resolution Drift) penetrated to $794\;\mathrm{m}$ $90\%$ recovery), making this site the deepest drille d in West Antarctica with a ship-based rig and resulting in the larges t overall recovered length of core and the highest percentage recovery in all of Antarctica. We collected almost continuous core fro m recent through the Pleistocene and Pliocene and into the uppe r Miocene. At Site U1533, we drilled to $383\;\mathrm{m}$ $70\%$ recovery) into th e more condensed sequence at the lower flank of the same sedimen t drift. The cores from both sites contain unique sample material suitable to study the cyclicity of ice sheet advance and retreat processes as well as bottom-water circulation and water mass changes. In particular, Site U1532 revealed a sequence of Pliocene lithofacie s with an excellent paleomagnetic record for high-resolution climat e change studies of the previously sparsely sampled Pacific margin o f West Antarctica.  

Despite the drilling success at both sites, the overall expeditio n experienced three difficulties that affected many of the scientific objectives of all five hypotheses of Proposal 839:  

1. The extensive sea ice on the continental shelf prevented us from drilling any of the primary proposed sites located on the shelf. The two sites that we did successfully drill were added to the project in early 2018 after the record-setting austral summer sea ice cover in 2017/2018 extended over all approved primary and alternate sites from the proposal, forcing the creation of additional alternate plans. The sea ice remaining from 2018 became multiyear ice in 2019, limiting the breakout that could happen in a single season. During Expedition 379, sea ice was never at a level low enough for JOIDES Resolution to enter the shelf, even when sea ice became less concentrated between the continental rise and the open-water polynyas where many of the shelf sites are located.  

2. On the continental rise, we faced a steady stream of icebergs of various sizes that approached the ship and frequently forced us to pause drilling or leave the hole entirely. The overall downtime caused by approaching icebergs was $50\%$ of our time spent on site (Table T1). This large iceberg abundance in the Amundsen Sea during the austral summer was possibly unprecedented and may have been caused by major calving events of the ice shelves during the last $2{-}3\,\mathrm{y}$ .  

3. Because of an injury to a member of the ship’s crew, we had to cut the expedition short by 1 week. Before the unfortunate accident, which led to a medical evacuation, we intended to complete Site U1533 by coring through the mid-Miocene climate transition, complete downhole logging for the first time during the expedition, and collect APC cores at proposed Primary Site ASRE-05B near the foot of the continental slope, which had become accessible in the days before. Although all three of these goals likely would not have been possible in the last 7 days of the cruise, it is likely at least two of them would have been achieved.  

Because of these three unexpected and extreme circumstances, we were unable to achieve many important objectives, including obtaining ice-proximal shelf records and collecting cores from the Mid-Miocene Climate Optimum, the Oligocene/Miocene boundary, and the Eocene–Oligocene transition. Drilling sites are needed to obtain ice-proximal records from these transitions for a full understanding of the proximal glacial history in this region, which is one of the key components of IODP’s transect approach to understanding high-latitude climate history. The Expedition 379 sites were designed to obtain records of past warm deepwater incursions onto the shelf that are the cause of present melting. Models suggest that the current incursion of warm deepwater to the base of the ice is an unsustainable situation, but we do not yet have records showing whether warm water has encroached onto the shelf prior to the Holocene and, if so, how the WAIS responded. The study of such records from the shelf is one of the central scientific objectives of the proposal for Expedition 379.  

# Preliminary assessment of scientific objectives  

The scientific objectives for this expedition were built on five hypotheses about the dynamics of the WAIS and related paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic conditions. Based on a preliminary analysis of the core material and data collected during the expedition, we assess each of the five hypotheses below.  

From the outset, Expedition 379 included a wide range of primary and alternate sites to allow for drilling in a range of sea ice conditions. All five objectives were addressed at most sites, both primary and alternate. However, the third tier of drill targets on the continental rise, proposed in case of extreme sea ice cover, could only be used to address the first three hypotheses in a more indirect way, and these third-tier sites were the only sites achieved during Expedition 379. Nonetheless, high-quality core recovery combined with slight modifications to our research approach allows each of the five hypotheses to be addressed to some degree.  

Sites U1532 and U1533 are located on a sediment drift, the Resolution Drift, on the continental rise north of the Amundsen Sea Embayment shelf edge (Figure F1). Coring at both sites recovered relatively undisturbed sequences from the late Miocene to Quaternary.  

Coring at Site U1532 recovered silty clay(stone) with dispersed sand and gravel and variable biogenic content in five holes to a core depth of $787~\mathrm{m}$ (Figures F4, F8). Linear sedimentation rate calculated between magnetostratigraphic age control points shows a significant downcore increase in sedimentation rate that averages ${\sim}2$ $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the Pleistocene, ${\sim}18~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the middle Pliocene, and ${\sim}41\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ during the latest Miocene to early Pliocene. The highest sedimentation rate $({\sim}61~\mathrm{cm/ky})$ is documented for the time between 4.49 and $4.63\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . The lowest sedimentation rate $({\sim}10\,\mathrm{cm/ky})$ is calculated for the early Pliocene between 4.63 and $4.80\ \mathrm{Ma}$ and may indicate an episodic decrease in sediment flux to the site or possibly the presence of a short hiatus in this interval.  

Sediments recovered at Site U1533 consist mainly of silty clay(stone) with varying biogenic content and amounts of bioturbation and rare occurrences of diamict and conglomerate intervals. Four holes were drilled at this site, reaching a total core depth of $382.6~\mathrm{m}$ (Figures F6, F9). Similar trends in sedimentation rates are documented at Sites U1532 and U1533, but sedimentation rates are two to three times lower at Site U1533. Linear sedimentation rate shows an overall downcore increase that averages ${\sim}1.4\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the Pleistocene, ${\sim}5.4~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ between ${\sim}4.5$ and $2.6\ \mathrm{Ma}$ in the Pliocene, and ${\sim}15.5\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ between ${\sim}5.2$ and $4.5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ in the earliest Pliocene. The highest sedimentation rate $({\sim}21{-}22\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ at Site U1533 is recorded for the early Pliocene between 4.493 and 4.631 Ma and between 4.997 and $5.235\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . The lowest sedimentation rate at Sit e U1533 $({\sim}3\,\mathrm{\cm/ky})$ is documented for a Pliocene phase betwee n 4.631 and $4.799\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . A similar decrease in sedimentation rate is thu s inferred for the same time interval at Sites U1532 and U1533, wa s also observed at Leg 178 Site 1095 on the western Antarctic Peninsula rise (Acton et al., 2002), and may indicate a regional decrease i n terrigenous sediment flux between 4.63 and $4.80\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .

1. Hypothesis H1: the WAIS responded to atmospheric and oceanic warming by a major retreat from the shelf or by even partial to full collapse.  

A primary goal of Expedition 379 is to reconstruct the glacial history of West Antarctica from the Paleogene to recent times with a focus on the dynamic behavior of the WAIS during the Neogene an d Quaternary, especially possible partial or even full WAIS collapses. Particular emphasis is placed on studying the response of the WAI S at times when the $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ in Earth’s atmosphere exceeded $400\,\mathrm{{ppm}}$ an d atmospheric and oceanic temperatures were higher than at present.  

Recovery of core on the continental rise at Sites U1532 an d U1533 cannot give a direct answer regarding the configuration o f the WAIS on the shelf or retreat of its grounding line across th e shelf. However, the sediments contained in the cores offer a range o f initial clues about past ice sheet extent and retreat that will be elucidated in postcruise analyses. At both sites, coarse-grained sediments  interpreted  to  be  IRD  were  identified  throughout  all recovered time periods. Cyclicity is a dominant feature of the core s and is interpreted to represent alternations between warmer an d colder periods, with sediments deposited during warmer period s being characterized by variable but generally higher microfossil abundance and higher IRD contents than sediments deposite d during colder periods that are predominantly characterized by gra y laminated terrigenous mud(stones). A revised age model will b e completed after the expedition, and tuning of Expedition 379 dat a sets to precise time periods will follow. However, an initial comparison of these cycles with published upper Pleistocene records fro m the region (e.g., Hillenbrand et al., 2009) suggest that the units interpreted as records of warmer time intervals in the cores are tied t o global interglacial periods and the units interpreted as deposits o f colder periods are tied to global glacial periods. Postcruise work t o determine IRD accumulation rates over time will allow identification of pulses of glacial sediment input that may be representative o f major calving events.

More specific evidence of major reductions in the size of th e WAIS or even its collapse will arise from studying the provenance o f coarse-grained IRD and fine-grained detritus at the drill sites. IR D pulses often represent major calving events, although the signal ca n be ambiguous because it may simply be a local increase in accumulation or, barring detailed age constraints, a signal of decreased flu x of fine-grained material. Therefore, layers rich in IRD will be target s for more detailed studies aimed at identifying the provenance of th e IRD. Coarse grains will be identified by visual description and geochemical and mineralogical analyses that will also be applied t o fine-grained detritus, including Sr-Nd signatures, to determine th e source of glaciogenic sediment deposited on the Resolution Drif t and thus to infer the extent of subglacial erosion and grounded ic e in the West Antarctic hinterland. A change in provenance over tim e at the site will be an indication of varying positions of the groundin g line. Specific isotopic signatures, including Pb isotopes, will be use d to identify patterns of bedrock weathering that may indicate specific source rocks were exposed subaerially. Additionally, differen t clay mineral signatures with geochemical analyses (including SrNd) in the fine-grained fraction may be identified as having com e from specific regions onshore, allowing further identification of th e source of sediment shed to the region and thus indicating how fa r the ice may have retreated.  

These combined signals will allow reconstruction of the ic e sheet since the late Miocene based on the amount and source o f sediment shed to the drill sites. Results from ANDRILL Core AND1B suggest repeated WAIS collapses during warm early middle Pliocene and Pleistocene interglacials (e.g., during MIS 31) (Naish et al., 2009; Pollard and DeConto, 2009; McKay et al., 2012; Villa et al., 2012). The hypothesis of WAIS collapse needs confirmation with  a less ambiguous record from an outlet that is exclusively affected b y ice draining the WAIS. The cores recovered during Expedition 37 9 may not give unambiguous information on past WAIS configuration because they were collected from a drift that has also been affected by lateral, bottom-current controlled sediment transport; however, the records of glaciogenic sediment delivery to the site s will give an integrated signal that will record major changes in ic e sheet extent.  

2. Hypothesis H2: ice-proximal records of ice sheet dynamics in the Amundsen Sea correlate with global records of ice-volume changes and proxy records for atmospheric and ocean temperatures.  

A goal of Expedition 379 is to correlate the WAIS-proximal records of ice sheet dynamics in the Amundsen Sea with global records of ice-volume changes and proxy records for air and seawate r temperatures. As described above, the initial interpretation of core s from Sites U1532 and U1533 shows repeated alternations betwee n different facies interpreted to represent glacial–interglacial cycles. Comparison with dated gravity and piston cores nearby (e.g., Hillenbrand et al., 2002, 2009) suggest that the cycles identified in core s from both sites are correlative with global oxygen-isotope records. The pattern holds at least as far back as MIS 35, and thus severa l “superinterglacials” have been recovered. Ongoing work will focu s on tuning the age model, particularly for Pliocene warm interval s that are not yet well constrained, to confirm these initial interpretations and allow more detailed analyses, including deconvolving th e glacial–interglacial signals from what may be independent change s in ocean currents delivering sediment to the drill sites.  

Work on proxies will be conducted to determine paleoceanographic characteristics, including surface water temperature, salinity, current speed, and water mass origins. These data, which ar e independent of the specific age models, will allow the record of ic e sheet fluctuations to be tied to local temperature and current information as well as to the global records of ice volume.  

3. Hypothesis H3: the stability of marine-based WAIS margins is and has been controlled by warm deepwater incursions onto the shelf.  

Today, the dramatic Amundsen Sea sector ice loss is attribute d to incursions of warm CDW reaching the base of the ice shelve s fringing the WAIS (Joughin et al., 2014). Such incursions have bee n identified in the Holocene (Hillenbrand et al., 2017; Minzoni et al., 2017) and recent sediments (Smith et al., 2017), but it is unclea r how often such incursions have happened further in the past or ho w the ice may have responded. Therefore, another goal of Expeditio n 379 is to study the relationship between incursions of CDW ont o the continental shelf of the Amundsen Sea Embayment and the stability of marine-based ice sheet margins under such warm-wate r conditions. Postcruise work will try to fingerprint water masse s flowing across the drill site, and multiple proxies will estimate surface water temperature, including lipid paleothermometers, trac e metal data from calcareous foraminifer shells, and diatom-base d temperature proxies. However, most of these analyses will yield details of either surface water or bottom-water mass properties tha t may not directly be linked to changes in CDW upwelling onto th e Amundsen Sea shelf. The difference in Pleistocene diatom accumulation between Sites U1532 and U1533 cannot be explained by loca l surface water productivity differences. Consequently, the differences may result from enhanced advection of pelagic diatoms at Sit e U1533. This process will be explored as a potential signal of CD W changes over time. Estimates of broad-scale temperature prox y changes over time will be compared with the IRD signal and othe r records of ice sheet change, allowing correlation between temperature at the drill sites and ice sheet behavior.  

4. Hypothesis H4: major WAIS advances onto the middle and outer shelf have occurred since the middle Miocene.  

One of the aims during Expedition 379 was to obtain record s from various sites on the Amundsen Sea Embayment shelf from unconformities within strata that document frequent advance and retreat  of  grounded  ice  from  the  late  Miocene  until  th e Pliocene/Pleistocene. Seismic data reveal progradational and aggradational deposition on the outer shelf and slope probably since th e mid-Miocene (e.g., Nitsche et al., 1997, 2000; Hochmuth and Gohl, 2013; Gohl et al., 2013b). The seismic stratigraphic age model of th e shelf sequences by Gohl et al. (2013b) is only constrained by far-distance correlation of seismic reflection characteristics and pattern s with those observed and age-dated from the Ross Sea shelf (e.g., D e Santis et al., 1999) due to the lack of deep drill sites on the Amundsen Sea shelf. We were unable to access the open-water polynyas o n the shelf with JOIDES Resolution during Expedition 379 because o f sea ice on the outer shelf, which prevented us from obtaining suc h direct shelf records.  

The drill cores from both rise sites, however, recovered sediments of terrigenous origin intercalated or mixed with pelagic an d hemipelagic deposits. In particular, Site U1533, which is locate d near a deep-sea channel running from the lower continental slop e to the abyssal plain, contains graded beds as well as clasts transported downslope from the shelf by turbidity currents or othe r gravitational transport processes.  

The association of lithologic facies in both sites predominantl y reflects the interplay of downslope and contouritic sediment suppl y with more pelagic sediment input during phases of seasonal openmarine conditions, which are inferred from a greater amount of biogenic material documenting relatively sustained periods of relatively high marine productivity. Recovered dispersed granules an d pebbles, clasts, and discontinuous bands of coarse sand and granules in the cores are interpreted to indicate persistent but likely lowintensity ice rafting that may have increased periodically durin g warmer periods. Because these observations can be made throughout the Pleistocene and Pliocene and into the upper Miocene, w e can infer from drilling that grounded ice frequently covered most o f the Amundsen Sea shelf since at least the late Miocene.  

Despite the lack of drill cores from the shelf, our records fro m the continental rise reveal the timing of glacial advances onto th e shelf and thus the existence of a continent-wide ice sheet in Wes t Antarctica for prolonged periods since at least the late Miocene. Hypotheses of earlier phases of WAIS expansion in the Amundse n Sea sector remain untested by drill records.  

5. Hypothesis H5: the first WAIS advance onto the inner Amundsen Sea continental shelf occurred during the Oligocene and was related to the uplift of Marie Byrd Land.  

The relationship between the onset of major West Antarctic glaciation and the continental paleotopography necessary for growin g a substantial ice sheet has so far only been addressed by numerical modeling (DeConto and Pollard, 2003; Wilson et al., 2013). Suc h modeling indicates that an elevated Marie Byrd Land dome migh t be required for a large ice sheet to form in the Amundsen Sea/Mari e Byrd Land sector. Seismological models show that a low-velocity, presumably hotter than normal mantle exists beneath Marie Byr d Land today (e.g., Lloyd et al., 2015). An objective of Expedition 37 9 was to reveal evidence from drill records that will allow reconstruction of the timing and rates of an uplift that has been inferred b y studies of the Marie Byrd Land dome exhumation and erosion history (e.g., Rocchi et al., 2006; Wilson and Luyendyk, 2009; Wilson e t al., 2012, 2013; Spiegel et al., 2016). The latest thermochronological study suggests an uplift not earlier than the early Miocene (Spiegel et al., 2016).  

Although we were unable to drill cores for detailed provenanc e and thermochronological analyses of samples from the shelf, core s from both rise sites contain abundant coarse-fraction sediment s and clasts of plutonic origin transported by either downslope processes or ice rafting. The common lithic types are polycrystallin e quartz and K-feldspar granite. Biotite-bearing leucogranite and diorite are also present. If detailed provenance studies confirm our preliminary assessment that the origin of these samples is plutoni c bedrock from Marie Byrd Land, their thermochronological recor d will potentially reveal timing and rates of denudation and erosio n linked to crustal uplift.  

The chronostratigraphy of both drill sites enables the generatio n of a seismic sequence stratigraphy not only for the Amundsen Se a rise but also for the area offshore the Amundsen Sea Embaymen t and farther west along the Marie Byrd Land margin into the easternmost Ross Sea through a connecting network of seismic lines.  A detailed analysis of correlated seismic unit boundaries and unconformities will allow reconstruction of the Marie Byrd Land dom e uplift at least back to the earliest age-dated horizons of the late Miocene and, with an appropriate seismic stratigraphic age model usin g estimates on earlier sedimentation rates, possibly even back to th e Oligocene or earlier.  

In addressing the objectives of this hypothesis, the thermochronological analyses and seismic sequence stratigraphy will make us e of the drilled core samples and the core data from independen t methods to test the hypothesis of the Marie Byrd Land uplift and it s role in early ice sheet evolution.
