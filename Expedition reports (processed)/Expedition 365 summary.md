# Abstract  

The Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) is a coordinated, multiexpedition International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) drilling project designed to investigate faul t mechanics  and  seismogenesis  along  subduction  megathrust s through direct sampling, in situ measurements, and long-ter m monitoring in conjunction with allied laboratory and numerica l modeling studies. The fundamental scientific objectives of the NanTroSEIZE drilling project include characterizing the nature of faul t slip and strain accumulation, fault and wall rock composition, faul t architecture, and state variables throughout the active plate boundary system. IODP Expedition 365 is part of NanTroSEIZE Stage 3, with the following primary objectives:  

1. Retrieval of a temporary observatory at Site C0010 that began monitoring temperature and pore pressure within the major splay thrust fault (termed the “megasplay”) at 400 meters below seafloor in November 2010.   
2. Deployment of a complex long-term borehole monitoring system (LTBMS) designed to be connected to the Dense Oceanfloor Network System for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET) seafloor cabled observatory network postexpedition.  

The LTBMS incorporates multilevel pore pressure sensing, a volumetric strainmeter, tiltmeter, geophone, broadband seismometer, accelerometer, and thermistor string. Together with an existing observatory at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site C0002 and  a planned future installation near the trench, the Site C0010 observatory allows monitoring within and above regions of contrasting behavior of the megasplay fault and the plate boundary as a whole. These include a site above the updip edge of the locked zone (Sit e  

C0002), a shallow site in the megasplay fault zone and its footwall (Site C0010), and a site at the tip of the accretionary prism (possibl e future  installation  at  Integrated  Ocean  Drilling  Program  Sit e C0006). Together, this suite of observatories has the potential t o capture deformation spanning a wide range of timescales (e.g., seismic and microseismic activity, slow slip, and interseismic strain accumulation) across a transect from near-trench to the seismogeni c zone. Site C0010 is located $3.5~\mathrm{km}$ along strike to the southwest o f Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site C0004. The site was drille d and cased during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditio n 319, with casing screens spanning a ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{m}$ interval that includes th e megasplay fault, and suspended with a temporary instrument package (a “SmartPlug”), which included pressure and temperature sensors. During Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 332 i n late 2010, the instrument package was replaced with an upgrade d sensor package (the “GeniusPlug”), which included a set of geochemical and biological experiments in addition to pressure an d temperature sensors.  

Expedition 365 achieved its primary scientific and operationa l objectives, including recovery of the GeniusPlug with a ${>}5$ y recor d of pressure and temperature conditions within the shallow megasplay fault zone, geochemical samples, and its in situ microbial colonization experiment; and installation of the LTBMS. The pressur e records from the GeniusPlug include high-quality records of formation and seafloor responses to multiple fault slip events, includin g the 11 March 2011 Tohoku M9 and 1 April 2016 Mie-ken Nanto-ok i M6 earthquakes. The geochemical sampling coils yielded in sit u pore fluids from the splay fault zone, and microorganisms were successfully cultivated from the colonization unit. The complex senso r array, in combination with the multilevel hole completion, is one o f the most ambitious and sophisticated observatory installations i n scientific ocean drilling (similar to that in Hole C0002G, deploye d in 2010). Overall, the installation went smoothly, efficiently, an d ahead of schedule. The extra time afforded by the efficient observatory deployment was used for coring in Holes C0010B–C0010E. Despite challenging hole conditions, the depth interval corresponding to the screened casing across the megasplay fault was successfully sampled in Hole C0010C, and the footwall of the megaspla y was sampled in Hole C0010E, with ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ recovery for both zones.  

In the hanging wall of the megasplay fault (Holes C0010C an d C0010D), we recovered indurated silty clay with occasional ash layers and sedimentary breccias. Mudstones show different degrees o f deformation spanning from occasional fractures to intervals o f densely fractured scaly claystones of up to ${>}10\,\mathsf{c m}$ thickness. Spars e faulting with low displacement (usually $<\!2\;\mathrm{cm}$ ) is seen in core an d exhibits primarily normal and, rarely, reversed sense of slip. Whe n present, ash was entrained along fractures and faults. In Hol e C0010E, the footwall to the megasplay fault was recovered. Sediments are horizontally to gently dipping and mainly comprise silt o f olive-gray color. The hanging wall sediments recovered in Hole s C0010C–C0010D range in age from 3.79 to $5.59\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and have bee n thrust over the younger footwall sediments in Hole C0010E, ranging in age from 1.56 to $1.67\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . The deposits of the underthrus t sediment prism are less indurated than the hanging wall mudstone s and show lamination on a centimeter scale. The material is less intensely deformed than the mudstones, and apart from occasiona l fracturation (some of it being drilling disturbance), evidence o f structural features is absent.  

# Introduction  

Subduction zones account for $90\%$ of global seismic moment release and generate damaging earthquakes and tsunamis with potentially disastrous effects on heavily populated coastal areas (e.g., La y et al., 2005; Moreno et al., 2010; Simons et al., 2011). Understandin g the processes that govern the strength, nature, and distribution o f slip along these plate boundary fault systems is a crucial step towar d evaluating earthquake and tsunami hazards. More generally, characterizing fault slip behavior and mechanical state at all plat e boundary types through direct sampling, near-field geophysical observations, measurement of in situ conditions, and shore-based laboratory experiments is a fundamental and societally relevant goal o f modern earth science. To this end, several recent and ongoing drilling programs have targeted portions of active plate boundary fault s that have either slipped coseismically during large earthquakes o r have nucleated smaller events. These efforts include the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (Hickman et al., 2004), the Taiwan-Chelungpu Drilling Project (Ma, 2005), and Integrated Ocea n Drilling Program drilling in the Nankai Trough (Nankai Troug h Seismogenic  Zone  Experiment  [NanTroSEIZE];  Tobin  an d Kinoshita, 2006a, 2006b) and in the high-slip region of the Marc h 2011 Tohoku earthquake (Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project; Expedition 343/343T Scientists, 2013).  

# Background  

# Geological setting  

The Nankai Trough is formed by subduction of the Philippin e Sea plate to the northwest beneath the Eurasian plate at a rate o f ${\sim}40{-}60\,\mathrm{~mm/y}$ (Figure F1; Seno et al., 1993; Miyazaki and Heki, 2001). The convergence direction is slightly oblique to the trench, and sediments of the Shikoku Basin are actively accreting at the deformation front. The Nankai Trough is among the most extensivel y studied subduction zones in the world, and great earthquakes ar e well documented in historical and archaeological records (e.g., Ando, 1975). It has been a focus site for studies of seismogenesis b y both the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program and the U.S. MARGINS initiative, based on the wealth of geological and geophysical data available.  

The Nankai Trough has a $1300{\mathrm{~y~}}$ historical record of recurrin g great earthquakes that are typically tsunamigenic, including th e 1944 Tonankai M8.2 and 1946 Nankaido M8.3 earthquakes (Ando, 1975; Hori et al., 2004). The rupture area and zone of tsunami generation for the 1944 event (within which the site of International Ocean Discovery Program [IODP] Expedition 365 is located) ar e now reasonably well understood (Ichinose et al., 2003; Baba et al., 2005, 2006). Land-based geodetic studies suggest that currently th e plate boundary thrust is strongly locked (Miyazaki and Heki, 2001). Similarly, the relatively low level of microseismicity near the updi p limits of the 1940s earthquakes (Obana et al., 2001) implies significant interseismic strain accumulation on the megathrust. However, recent observations of very low frequency (VLF) earthquake s within or just below the accretionary prism in the drilling are a (Obara and Ito, 2005) demonstrate that interseismic strain is no t confined to slow elastic strain accumulation. Slow slip phenomena, referred to as episodic tremor and slip, including episodic slow sli p events and nonvolcanic tremor (Schwartz and Rokosky, 2007), ar e also widely known to occur in the downdip part of the rupture zon e (Ito et al., 2007). In the subducting Philippine Sea plate mantle below the rupture zone, weak seismicity is observed (Obana et al., 2005). Seaward of the subduction zone, deformation of the incoming ocean crust is suggested by microearthquakes, as documente d by ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) studies (Obana et al., 2005).  

The region offshore the Kii Peninsula on Honshu Island was selected for seismogenic zone drilling for several reasons. First, th e rupture area of the most recent great earthquake, the 1944 Tonanka i $_{\mathrm{M8.2}}$ event, is well constrained by recent seismic and tsunami waveform inversions (e.g., Tanioka and Satake, 2001; Kikuchi et al., 2003). Slip inversion studies suggest that only in this region did pas t coseismic rupture clearly extend shallow enough for drilling (Ichinose et al., 2003; Baba and Cummins, 2005), and an updip zone o f large slip has been identified and targeted (Figure F2). Notably, coseismic slip during events such as the 1944 Tonankai earthquak e may have occurred on the megasplay fault in addition to the plat e boundary décollement (Ichinose et al., 2003; Baba et al., 2006). Th e megasplay fault is therefore a primary drilling target equal in importance to the basal décollement. Second, OBS campaigns and onshore high-resolution geodetic studies (though of short duration ) indicate significant interseismic strain accumulation (e.g., Miyazak i and Heki, 2001; Obana et al., 2001). Third, the region offshore th e Kii Peninsula is generally typical of the Nankai margin in terms o f heat flow and sediment on the incoming plate. This is in contrast t o the area offshore Cape Muroto (the location of previous scientifi c ocean drilling) where both local stratigraphic variations associate d with basement topography and anomalously high heat flow hav e been documented (Moore et al., 2001, 2005; Moore and Saffer, 2001). Finally, the drilling targets are within the operational limits o f riser drilling by the D/V Chikyu (i.e., maximum of $2500\mathrm{~m~}$ wate r depth and $7000\,\mathrm{m}$ subseafloor penetration). In the seaward portion s of the Kumano Basin, the seismogenic zone lies ${\sim}4700{-}6000\ \mathrm{m}$ beneath the seafloor (Nakanishi et al., 2002).

Seismic studies/site survey data   
2006, Japan and the United States conducted a joint 3-D seismic reflection survey over an ${\sim}11\,\mathrm{km}\times55\,\mathrm{km}$ area, acquired by PGS Geophysical, an industry service company (Moore et al., 2009). This 3- D data volume was the first deep-penetration, fully 3-D marine surve y ever acquired for basic research purposes and has been used t o (1) refine selection of drill sites and targets in the complex megasplay fault region, (2) define the 3-D regional structure and seismi c  

A significant volume of site survey data has been collected in th e drilling area over many years, including multiple generations of 2- D seismic reflection (e.g., Park et al., 2002), wide-angle refraction (Nakanishi et al., 2002), passive seismicity, heat flow (Yamano et al., 2003), side-scan sonar, swath bathymetry, and submersible and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dive studies (Ashi et al., 2002). I n stratigraphy, (3) analyze physical properties of the subsurfac e through seismic attribute studies, and (4) assess drilling safet y (Moore et al., 2007, 2009). These high-resolution 3-D data are bein g used in conjunction with physical property, petrophysical, and geophysical data obtained from core analyses and both wireline an d logging-while-drilling (LWD) logging to allow extensive and highresolution integration of core, logs, and seismic data.

# NanTroSEIZE drilling project  

The NanTroSEIZE project is a multiexpedition, multistag e IODP drilling project focused on understanding the mechanics o f seismogenesis and rupture propagation along subduction plat e boundary faults. The drilling program includes a coordinated effor t to sample and instrument the plate boundary system at several locations offshore the Kii Peninsula (Tobin and Kinoshita, 2006a, 2006b; Figures F1, F2). The main objectives are to understand the following:  

• The mechanisms and processes controlling the updip aseismic– seismic transition of the megathrust fault system, • The processes of earthquake and tsunami generation, • The mechanics of strain accumulation and release, • The absolute mechanical strength of the plate boundary fault, and • The potential role of a major upper plate fault system (termed the “megasplay” fault) in seismogenesis and tsunamigenesis.  

The drilling program aims to evaluate a set of core hypothese s through riser and riserless drilling, long-term observatories, and associated geophysical, laboratory, and numerical modeling efforts. The following hypotheses are paraphrased from the original Integrated Ocean Drilling Program proposals and outlined in Tobin an d Kinoshita (2006a, 2006b):  

1. Systematic, progressive material and state changes control the onset of seismogenic behavior on subduction thrust faults.   
2. Subduction megathrusts are weak faults.   
3. Plate motion is accommodated primarily by coseismic frictional slip in a concentrated zone (i.e., the fault is locked during the interseismic period).   
4. Physical properties of the plate boundary system (including the fault system and its hanging wall and footwall) change with time during the earthquake cycle.   
5. A significant, laterally extensive upper plate fault system (the megasplay fault; Park et al., 2002) slips in discrete events that may include tsunamigenic slip during great earthquakes. It remains locked during the interseismic period and accumulates strain.  

Sediment-dominated subduction zones such as the East Aleutian, Cascadia, Sumatra, and Nankai margins are characterized b y repeated occurrences of great earthquakes of ${\sim}\mathrm{M}8.0{+}$ (Ruff an d Kanamori, 1983). Although the causal mechanisms are not well understood (e.g., Byrne et al., 1988; Moore and Saffer, 2001; Saffer an d Marone, 2003) and great earthquakes are also known to occu r within sediment-starved subduction zones such as the Japa n Trench, the updip limit of the seismogenic zones at these margins i s thought to correlate with a topographic break, often associated wit h the outer rise (e.g., Byrne et al., 1988; Wang and Hu, 2006). Alon g the Nankai margin, high-resolution seismic reflection profile s across the outer rise clearly document a large out-of-sequenc e thrust fault system (the megasplay fault, after Park et al., 2002) tha t branches from the plate boundary décollement close to the updi p limit of inferred coseismic rupture in the 1944 Tonankai $_{\mathrm{M8.2}}$ earthquake (Figures F1, F2). Several lines of evidence indicate tha t the megasplay system is active and that it may accommodate an appreciable component of plate boundary motion. However, the partitioning of strain between the lower plate interface (the décollemen t zone) and the megasplay system, as well as the nature and mechanisms of fault slip as a function of depth and time on the megaspla y are not understood. As stated in the fifth hypothesis above, one o f the first-order goals in characterizing the seismogenic zone alon g the Nankai Trough, which bears both on understanding subductio n zone megathrust behavior globally and on defining tsunami hazards, is to document the role of the megasplay fault in accommodating plate motion (both seismically and interseismically) and t o characterize its mechanical and hydrologic behavior.  

NanTroSEIZE Phase 1, conducted in 2007–2008, included thre e riserless drilling expeditions targeting the incoming sediments an d ocean crust to characterize their physical properties, composition, and state (pore pressure and temperature). Phase 2, conducted i n 2009–2011, included (1) the first riser drilling in the Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program at Site C0009 in the Kumano Basin, (2) observatory installations at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site s C0002 (long-term borehole monitoring system [LTBMS]) an d C0010 (SmartPlug), and (3) additional riserless coring of subductio n inputs and mass wasting deposits on the continental slope (Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010; Kopf, Araki, Toczko, and the Expeditio n 332 Scientists, 2011; Underwood et al., 2010; Henry, Kanamatsu, Moe, and the Expedition 333 Scientists, 2012). Phase 3, begun i n 2010 and continuing with this expedition, includes riser drilling i n Holes C0002F, C0002N, and C0002P (Tobin, Hirose, Saffer, Toczko, Maeda, Kubo, and the Expedition 348 Scientists, 2015) and installation of an LTBMS in Hole C0010A. To date, the NanTroSEIZE project has included 10 expeditions, encompassing a diverse suite o f operations and lengths of individual expeditions, all conducted b y the Chikyu.  

NanTroSEIZE Stage 1 included three coordinated riserless drilling expeditions (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition s 314, 315, and 316). Eight sites were drilled across the continenta l slope and rise offshore the Kii Peninsula, many above the inferre d coseismic slip region of the 1944 Tonankai M8.2 earthquake. Th e first Stage 1 expedition (314; LWD Transect) used LWD to defin e physical properties, lithostratigraphy, and structures in advance o f coring operations (Kinoshita, Tobin, Ashi, Kimura, Lallemant, Screaton, Curewitz, Masago, Moe, and the Expedition 314/315/316 Scientists, 2009). This was followed by the first Center for Deep Eart h Exploration (CDEX) coring expedition (315; Mega-Splay Riser Pilot) aimed at sampling the materials and characterizing in situ conditions within the hanging wall of the megasplay fault to a depth o f 1000 meters below seafloor (mbsf) at Integrated Ocean Drillin g Program Site C0001 and in the Kumano Basin fill and underlyin g accretionary wedge to a depth of 1057 mbsf at Site C0002 (Ashi e t al., 2009). The third riserless expedition (316; Shallow Megaspla y and Frontal Thrusts) targeted the megasplay at a depth of 350–40 0 mbsf (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site C0004) as well as th e frontal thrust at the toe of the modern accretionary prism (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Sites C0006 and C0007) (Screato n et al., 2009).  

NanTroSEIZE Stage 2 operations began in 2009 with Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 319 (Riser/Riserless Observatory 1) followed by Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition s 322 (Subduction Inputs), 332 (Riserless Observatory), and 33 3 (Subduction Inputs 2 and Heat Flow). Expedition 319 include d (1) the first riser drilling in the Integrated Ocean Drilling Progra m (Site C0009), which penetrated the Kumano Basin fill and into accreted strata of the Nankai wedge overlying the locked subductio n thrust, and (2) drilling across the shallow megasplay fault with LW D to a total depth (TD) of 555 mbsf at Site C0010 and installation o f casing with screens positioned to span the megasplay at 407 mbs f (Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010). This hole was suspended with  a temporary  observatory  attached  to  a  retrievable  bridge  plu g (termed the “SmartPlug”) to monitor temperature and pore pressure at the fault zone. Expedition 322 characterized the subductio n inputs at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Sites C0011 and C001 2 (Underwood et al., 2010). Two more Stage 2 expeditions followed  a year later. Expedition 332 recovered and replaced the temporary observatory at Site C0010 and deployed the first permanent LTBMS i n Hole C0002G (Kopf, Araki, Toczko, and the Expedition 332 Scientists, 2011). Expedition 333 then conducted additional coring operations to complete the original objectives of Expedition 322 and t o sample mass wasting complexes on the continental slope (Henry, Kanamatsu, Moe, and the Expedition 333 Scientists, 2012).  

NanTroSEIZE Stage 3 operations to date comprise three expeditions: Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 326 (Plat e Boundary Deep Riser 1), 338 (Plate Boundary Deep Riser 2), an d 348 (Plate Boundary Deep Riser 3). Stage 3 has focused on rise r drilling, with the ultimate objective of penetrating the megaspla y fault at $\mathord{\sim}5000$ mbsf. Expedition 326 drilled Hole C0002F to 827. 5 mbsf to set shallow casing (Expedition 326 Scientists, 2011). Expedition 338 extended the hole to 2005 mbsf with LWD and also conducted riserless coring operations at Integrated Ocean Drillin g Program Sites C0002, C0022, and C0021 (Strasser et al., 2014). Expedition 348 deepened Site C0002 in Holes C0002N and C0002P t o a depth of 3056 mbsf (Tobin, Hirose, Saffer, Toczko, Maeda, Kubo, and the Expedition 348 Scientists, 2015) and included LWD as well as sampling cuttings and limited coring.  

Expedition 365 is part of NanTroSEIZE Stage 3, with the primary objectives of (1) retrieving the temporary observatory at Sit e C0010 and (2) deploying a complex long-term observatory, whic h was connected to the Dense Oceanfloor Network System for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET) seafloor cabled observatory network postcruise on 19 June 2016. Together with the existin g observatory at Site C0002 and the anticipated future installation a t Site C0006 (Figures F1, F2), the Site C0010 LTBMS allows monitoring within and above regions of contrasting behavior of the megasplay fault zone and plate boundary as a whole. These include a sit e above the updip edge of the “locked” zone (Site C0002), a shallo w site in the megasplay fault zone and footwall (Site C0010; this expedition), and a site at the toe of the accretionary prism (Site C0006), where possible monitoring has been motivated by observed slip i n the 11 March 2011 Tohoku earthquake that indicates coseismi c rupture may propagate to the trench at some margins (e.g., Fujiwar a et al., 2011). Together, the suite of NanTroSEIZE observatories ha s the potential to capture seismic and microseismic activity, slow slip, and interseismic strain accumulation along a transect from neartrench to the seismogenic zone. Such temporally continuous an d spatially distributed observations are necessary to understand ho w each part of the plate boundary functions through the seismic cycl e of megathrust earthquakes.  

# Scientific objectives and operational strategy Background  

Site C0010, located above the shallow megasplay fault and site d $3.5~\mathrm{km}$ southwest of previously drilled Site C0004 (Figures F1, F2, F3), was originally drilled with LWD and cased during Expeditio n 319. Operations included drilling with measurement while drillin g (MWD)/LWD across the megasplay fault to a TD of 555 mbsf, casing the borehole (with casing screens spanning the fault), conducting  an  observatory  “dummy  run”  to  test  strainmeter  an d seismometer deployment procedures, and installing a simple temporary pore pressure and temperature monitoring system (SmartPlug)  attached  to  a  retrievable  bridge  plug  (Expedition  31 9 Scientists, 2010). The hole was revisited during Expedition 332, when the SmartPlug was recovered and replaced with a similar temporary instrument package, which also included geochemical an d microbiological sampling coils and an in situ microbiological colonization experiment; this temporary instrument package is terme d the “GeniusPlug” (Kopf, Araki, Toczko, and the Expedition 332 Scientists, 2011; Figures F4, F5).

Drilling during Expedition 319 identified three distinct lithologic packages at Site C0010, defined on the basis of LWD data, combined with coring and LWD at nearby Site C0004 (located 3.5 t o the northeast along strike). From top to bottom, these lithologi c packages are hemipelagic slope deposits composed primarily o f mud with minor distal turbidite interbeds (Unit I, 0–182.5 m LW D depth below seafloor [LSF]), a thrust wedge composed of overconsolidated and fractured clay- and mudstones (Unit II, 182.5–40 7 m LSF), and overridden slope deposits (Unit III, 407 m LSF to TD).

At Site C0010, logging Unit I is divided into two subunits: Subuni t IA $(0{-}161.5\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{LSF})$ , characterized by gamma ray and resistivity patterns similar to those observed in logging Unit I at Site C0004 (Expedition 314 Scientists, 2009), and Subunit IB $(161.5{-}182.8\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{LSF})$ , interpreted as slope sediments composed of material reworke d from the underlying thrust wedge.  

For Expedition 365, the observatory system at Site $_{\mathsf{C0010\;c o n-}}$ sists of an array of sensors (Figure F6; see also LTBMS in the Expedition 365 methods chapter [Saffer et al., 2017a]) designed t o monitor crustal deformation and hydrologic processes in the offshore portion of the subduction system over a wide range of timescales.  These  monitoring  targets  include  seismicity  an d microseismicity, slow slip events and VLF earthquakes, hydrologi c transients, ambient pore pressure, and temperature. To allow th e high sampling rates and ensure power delivery for the long-ter m and continuous monitoring necessary to capture this full range o f events, the borehole observatory plans called for the observatory t o be  connected  to  the  DONET  submarine  cable  networ k (http://www.jamstec.go.jp/donet/e) after the drilling expeditio n in June 2016. The LTBMS installed at Site C0002 is also connecte d to this network, and the formation pressure data from either sit e can be viewed and downloaded at an open-access observatory dat a portal (http://offshore.geosc.psu.edu).  

# Scientific objectives  

The primary plan for Expedition 365 was to recover the GeniusPlug installed in Hole C0010A during Expedition 332 (shown in Figure F5), deepen the hole from 555 to 655 mbsf, and install th e LTBMS. Site C0010 constitutes the second LTBMS installatio n during NanTroSEIZE. The downhole configuration of the observa

tory includes (1) pressure ports, (2) a volumetric strainmeter, (3)  a broadband seismometer, (4) a tiltmeter, (5) three-component geophones, (6) three-component accelerometers, and (7) a thermometer array (Figure F6; see also LTBMS in the Expedition 36 5 methods chapter [Saffer et al., 2017a]). The observatory installatio n was planned to operate initially in a standalone mode at the wellhead, using batteries and data recorders, with data recovery by subsequent ROV operations. On 19 June 2016, an ROV cruis e downloaded initial data, conducted hydrostatic sensor checks fo r the pressure transducers, and connected the system to DONET s o that measurements can be observed in real time from a shore-base d monitoring station from that point onward.  

Observatory operations went smoothly and much faster tha n planned, enabling us to conduct coring operations. This degree o f contingency was not anticipated at the time of expedition planning, and as such, was not described in Kopf et al. (2015), and the expedition was not originally staffed for core sampling, measurements, o r description. Description and analysis of the cores was therefore deferred to a shore-based sampling party on board the Chikyu in th e port of Shimizu, Japan, in July–August 2016. The opportunity t o collect cores introduced new science objectives for the expedition, including sampling of material from the hanging wall and footwal l of the megasplay fault both for standard shipboard analyses and fo r subsequent shore-based study and characterization of the formation and interstitial fluids spanning the depth range of the screene d casing. The latter of these objectives, in particular, has the potentia l to greatly enhance interpretations of the LTBMS and GeniusPlu g data.  

Specific objectives for Site C0010 during Expedition 365 were to 1. Recover the GeniusPlug installed in 2010 and conduct initial shipboard analyses of the recovered pore pressure and tempera  

ture data, fluids sampled by the sampling coils, and microbiological colonization experiment.   
2. Deploy a LTBMS that includes pore pressure ports at three levels, a thermistor string, and a suite of geophysical instruments (strainmeter, tiltmeter, and seismometer) in a configuration like that in Hole C0002G (Kopf, Araki, Toczko, and the Expedition   
332 Scientists, 2011). The detailed configuration of the LTBMS and borehole is described in LTBMS in the Expedition 365 methods chapter (Saffer et al., 2017a).   
3. Drill, collect, and analyze core samples across the megasplay fault and spanning the interval of screened casing in Hole C0010A.  

# Operational strategy  

Planned work during Expedition 365 included two main operations at the cased borehole in Hole C0010A (Figure F7). The firs t operation was the recovery of the GeniusPlug. This was to begin following the transit from Shimizu Harbor to Site C0010 and afte r ROV dives to conduct a seafloor survey, set transponders, and remove the Hole C0010A well corrosion cap. Once complete, the vessel was to move away from the Kuroshio Current to a low-curren t area (LCA) to make up the GeniusPlug recovery bottom-hole assembly (BHA). The BHA consisted of the L-10 on/off tool, designe d to recover the retrievable bridge plug from which the GeniusPlu g was suspended. Once recovered from Hole C0010A, the vessel wa s to return to the LCA while the BHA was pulled out of the hole t o the rig floor; the GeniusPlug would then be moved to the laborator y for data download, and the OsmoSampler/Flow-through Osm o Colonization System (FLOCS) experiment would be moved to th e microbiology laboratory for sampling and analysis.  

The next operation was to extend previously drilled Hol e C0010A from 555 to 655 mbsf using a combination drill bit an d underreamer BHA. Once drilling was finished, the drilling/underreaming BHA was to be pulled out of the hole and replaced with  a scraper BHA to ensure the cased section of the well was clear of an y obstructions. The expedition science objectives would be completed with operations to deploy the LTBMS. This involved considerable moonpool preparation using newly developed guide roller s to run the completion.  

A major impediment to observatory deployment in the Nanka i region is the extremely strong Kuroshio Current. Current speeds u p to $6~\mathrm{kt}$ are possible, and the current flow past the drill string commonly results in vortex-induced vibration (VIV), which has cause d lost drill pipe, dropped casing, and destroyed electronic sensor s during past Integrated Ocean Drilling Program expeditions (Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010). CDEX has developed a series of mitigation techniques and equipment to minimize or suppress VIV. Thes e include the attachment of ropes to drill string sections exposed t o the current, preventing the formation of vortices as the curren t flows past the drill string. Other newly developed tools are th e moonpool guide rollers, which support the drill string in the moonpool and provide a safe platform for moonpool work, and guides fo r attaching the VIV-suppressing ropes, cables, and hydraulic flatpac k lines to the LTBMS observatory instruments.  

The operational plan called for the LTBMS to be made up fro m the bottom bullnose to the seafloor LTBMS head as the completio n was run into the moonpool. A series of system checks on the statu s of the strainmeter, tiltmeter, broadband seismometer, and pressur e sensor unit (PSU) were to be performed at set stages as the LTBM S and sensors were assembled. Once the LTBMS was completed an d run into the water, the Chikyu would then drift back into the Kuroshio Current to run the LTBMS into Hole C0010A. After checkin g that all systems were working, the LTBMS would be cemented i n place, and the vessel would release the LTBMS running tool and recover the drill string.

Coring operations were planned to maximize limited availabl e time in order to target the key interval spanning the megasplay faul t and the screened casing zone and to penetrate and sample the footwall. For this reason, in Hole C0010B (abandoned due to bad hol e conditions after a single core with no recovery) and subsequently i n Hole C0010C we planned to drill without coring to 300 mbsf and t o then core across the fault (located at 407 mbsf in Hole C0010A a s identified by LWD data). In Hole C0010C, coring reached 395 mbs f before hole conditions deteriorated, requiring that we abandon th e hole. For Holes C0010D and C0010E, the coring strategy was modified in light of limited remaining operational time. For these holes, we planned to drill without coring to a depth closer to the anticipated fault and then begin coring from ${\sim}15$ to $20\,\mathrm{m}$ above the megasplay and into the footwall. This depth was 385 mbsf in Hol e C0010D and 360 mbsf in Hole C0010E, where the megasplay wa s shallower because the hole was located ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ updip of Hole s C0010A–C0010D (cf. Figure F3).  

# Operations  

# Port call and transit to Site C0010  

Expedition 365 began in the port of Shimizu, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, on 26 March 2016. The first few days were spent quayside, loading cargo and supplies. The science party boarded th e Chikyu on 27 March and participated in the shipboard prespu d meeting on 28 March. The Chikyu sailed from Shimizu Harbor a t $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 March (see Table T1 in the Site C0010 chapter [Saffe r et al., 2017b]), lowered the azimuth thrusters, and arrived on location at Site C0010 at $0330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 March.  

# Site C0010  

While the supply boat searched for the Kuroshio Current edge , the ROV dove to survey the seabed, set transponders, and remov e the corrosion cap. The Chikyu moved to the LCA to begin runnin g the BHA in the hole (see Table T2 in the Site C0010 chapter [Saffe r et al., 2017b]) from $2145\,\mathrm{h}$ . The science party placed an accelerometer on the drill string to evaluate the Kuroshio Current VIV a s preparation for GeniusPlug recovery and LTBMS operations.  

The Chikyu reached the LCA $12\,\mathrm{nmi}$ northwest of Site C0010 a t $0000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 March 2016 and began drifting back to the well center. At $1136\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 April, an M6.0 earthquake struck, with the reporte d hypocenter ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{nmi}$ to the northwest of Site C0010 and $15\,\mathrm{km}$ deep. The earthquake was felt aboard the ship. Running drill pipe resumed, and on 1 April, the L-10 BHA was over the wellhead and wa s stabbed in. The BHA landed on the bridge plug and the drill strin g rotated to release the mechanical seal. The bridge plug and the GeniusPlug successfully cleared the wellhead at $2040\,\mathrm{h}$ . The L-10 BH A was pulled out of the hole as the Chikyu moved toward the LCA t o recover the BHA and GeniusPlug on deck. The L-10 tool, the bridg e plug, and the GeniusPlug were recovered on deck at $0500~\mathrm{h}$ on  3 April. The OsmoSampler portion of the GeniusPlug was opened, and the FLOCS and OsmoSampler experiments were moved to th e microbiology laboratory.  

The Chikyu began drifting to the LCA 8 nmi west of Site C001 0 and began rigging up the guide horn in preparation for drilling ou t the cement plug. From early on 4 April $(0100\;\mathrm{h})$ , the drilling an d underreaming BHA was assembled and run in the hole (see Tabl e T2 in the Site C0010 chapter [Saffer et al., 2017b]). Drilling out th e cement started from $1200~\mathrm{h}$ on 4 April. Once drilling out cemen t was completed, the underreamer was activated and opened the hol e until reaching TD (654 mbsf; $3206~\mathrm{m}$ below rotary table [BRT]) a t $1945\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . A short wiper trip confirmed no excessive overpull o r torque. The underreamer BHA was pulled out of the hole, reachin g the deck by 5 April. The $9\%$ inch casing scraper BHA was made u p and run in the hole (see Table T2 in the Site C0010 chapter [Saffer e t al., 2017b]). The BHA was stabbed into the Hole C0010A wellhea d and scraped to $2934\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT. The scraper BHA was pulled out of th e hole and laid down by $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 April. The guide horn was rigge d down, and preparations for running the LTBMS completion began. However, the approach of a cold front necessitated waiting o n weather until $0245~\mathrm{h}$ on 8 April. At that time, LTBMS preparation s were restarted.  

The LTBMS completion string was run in the hole, and miniscreens for pressure Port P1, cables, and sensors were attached t o the completion string. On the morning of 9 April, the sensor cable s were connected to the strainmeter, seismometer, and thermistor. Testing revealed that the strainmeter and seismometer were faulty, so the LTBMS was pulled out of the hole to the rig floor to replac e the faulty sensors with standby instruments. The testing cable wa s also identified to be faulty and was therefore replaced. Assembly o f the replacement sensors and LTBMS was completed by $1615\,\mathrm{h},$ an d the LTBMS completion was run in the hole, pausing on 10 April t o install the swellable packer in the moonpool from $1815\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . Th e LTBMS head and hydraulically activated running tool (HART) (se e Table T2 in the Site C0010 chapter [Saffer et al., 2017b]) wer e picked up then made up to the rest of the LTBMS completion assembly and lowered into the moonpool by $1700\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 11 April. There, the stainless steel hydraulic $\%$ inch lines leading from th e PSU mounted on the LTBMS head were connected to the flatpac k running down to the pressure ports. The PSU valves were kep t “open” to prevent damage during running. The sensor cables wer e measured and prepared for termination at Teledyne Oil and Ga s ODI connectors by 12 April. A data logger and battery unit wa s mounted on the ROV platform to collect data until the planne d connection to DONET.  

The LTBMS completion assembly was run into the water, and b y $1000~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 April the vessel was back at Site C0010. The LTBM S completion assembly reentered the Hole C0010A wellhead. Th e ROV moved the PSU 2-way valves from open to “closed” to protec t the lines from fouling during landing, circulation, and cementing. The LTBMS head was landed by $0515\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 April. Cementing wa s finished by $1045~\mathrm{h}$ . The HART was released from the LTBMS an d pulled out of the hole, and on 15 April the BHA was laid down o n the rig floor by $2300~\mathrm{h}$ . The moonpool completion guide, completion guide roller, and VIV-suppression rope drums were remove d from the working cart and blowout preventer cart so that rigging u p the guide horn could begin for coring operations at Site C0010.  A series of 10 sensor health checks (see Table T1 in the Site C001 0 chapter [Saffer et al., 2017b]) were run on the sensors at specifi c stages during the assembly and running of the LTBMS. Except fo r the sensor failure noted above, all health checks were positive.  

Contingency coring operations were originally planned to tes t the Turbine Driven Coring System developed by CDEX in preparation for deep coring operations. However, after considering th e large amount of expedition time remaining, the Co-Chief Scientists, Expedition Project Manager, and Operations Superintendent all agreed to move forward with rotary core barrel (RCB) coring in order to maximize potential science return. Coring was conducted i n four holes, all of which were drilled down without coring to ${}^{2300}$ mbsf: Holes C0010B (300–309.5 mbsf), C0010C (300–395 mbsf), C0010D (385–394.5 mbsf), and C0010E (360–391 mbsf). Corin g was most successful in Hole C0010C (Table T1) with $52.6\;\mathrm{m}$ of cor e collected for a $95\mathrm{~m~}$ advance $55.4\%$ recovery). Core recovery rate s tended to increase with depth in both Holes C0010C and C0010E. There were problems with borehole stability, and these require d abandoning each hole with the exception of Hole C0010E. Core recovery continued to be high at this site, but because the drawwork s needed scheduled maintenance, the consensus was to halt corin g operations once major targets were reached. With the recovery o f the RCB BHA on deck, science operations for Expedition 365 wer e completed (Table T2). The Chikyu returned to Shimizu Harbor o n 27 April and lowered the gangplank at $1030\,\mathrm{h}$ .

# Principal results  

# GeniusPlug  

One of the primary objectives of Expedition 365 was to recove r the GeniusPlug temporary observatory from Hole C0010A (Figure s F8, F9; see also Figure F4) and conduct initial analyses of the pressure and temperature data, fluid geochemical samples collected i n both chemical and biological sampling coils, and FLOCS for microbiology. All of these data and samples were successfully recovere d from the instrument package, although a significant fraction of fluids in the chemical and biological sampling coils was lost upon depressurization during ascent through the water column and on th e rig floor.  

The pressure and temperature records clearly document severa l key events during the ${\sim}5.3~\mathrm{y}$ deployment period (November 201 0 through April 2016). Initial analysis of the data illustrates two principal results. First, on the basis of hydraulic isolation of the formation  (downward  looking)  and  hydrostatic  reference  (upwar d looking) sensors, it is clear that the bridge plug successfully sealed, and thus that the downward-looking sensor provides a meaningfu l record of formation pressure. This is most evident at the start an d end of the deployment when the bridge plug was set and retrieved, respectively. In both cases, the hydrostatic pressure record exhibit s large perturbations associated with drill string movement and attaching/detaching the running tool, whereas the downward-lookin g pressure record is stable (Figure F10). Additionally, initial review o f the pressure-time series documents clear responses to several regional and local earthquakes. These include the 11 March 2011 Tohoku M9 and 1 April 2016 Mie-ken Nanto-oki M6 earthquake s (Figures F11, F12). The latter event occurred below and slightl y landward of Site C0010 and is manifested as the arrival of a wavetrain followed by a distinct pressure increase of ${\sim}0.4\,\mathrm{kPa}$ , likely indicating  compressional  coseismic  strain.  For  both  events,  th e subsequent tsunami wave is also clearly recorded in both the seafloor and formation sensors. These examples serve to highlight th e ability of offshore borehole observatory systems to sense a wid e

Analysis of the GeniusPlug fluid samples indicates that, fo r many elements (e.g., Cl, K, Ca, and Br), the fluids sampled by th e OsmoSampler coils are broadly consistent with formation pore flu

ids measured from cores at both Sites C0004 and C0010 (Figur e F13). However, some key differences were also observed betwee n the two sets of samples and between the GeniusPlug fluid sample s and previously collected interstitial pore waters. The biology coils,

which drew fluid from the screened interval of the borehole the n through the FLOCS unit and into the sampling coil, exhibit elevate d B and $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ and reduced Ba concentrations relative to the chemica l coils, which drew water directly from the borehole. Reduced Ba ar e consistent with barite precipitation in the FLOCS unit, whereas th e lower $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ in the chemistry coil may reflect microbial uptake of sulfate in the chemical coil due to unanticipated colonization of th e membrane itself. Gradually increasing salinity in the chemical coi l toward the inlet may reflect an artifact caused by leakage across th e membrane in the chemistry unit’s pump.  

The OsmoSampler and FLOCS (Figure F14A) provided an opportunity to sample native microbial communities living in the pervasively fractured thrust wedge, with the advantage that pristine i n situ fluids and microbes could be collected without drilling-induce d contamination. This marked the first deployment of a FLOCS uni t in a sedimentary environment. When the OsmoSampler an d FLOCS unit were recovered, substrates were subsampled for DN A analyses, microscopy, and culture experiments. The culture experiments were initiated on board and inoculated with substrates of th e FLOCS. The observed growth from these cultures—and not th e controls—suggests that the FLOCS successfully collected viable microorganisms (Figure F14B–F14G), validating the use of OsmoSampler and FLOCS technology in sedimentary environments. Future shore-based DNA analyses will further characterize thes e microbial communities and their metabolic potentials.  

# LTBMS installation  

As described in Scientific objectives, from bottom to top th e LTBMS included (see Figure F6) hydraulic ports to monitor por e fluid pressure in an open hole interval spanning from 602 mbsf t o the TD of 654 mbsf; a volumetric strainmeter (572–580.6 mbsf);  a tilt combo package that includes a broadband seismometer, geophone, accelerometer, tiltmeter, and a thermistor string mounted o n a sensor carrier $(565{-}572~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ; and an upper hydraulic port t o monitor pore pressure in a screened interval spanning the megasplay fault (Figures F15, F16, F17). The thermistor string data logger was mounted on the sensor carrier; however, the string itsel f consisted of 5 thermistors spanning from 396 to 563 mbsf. In addition, a hydraulic port was included in the instrument carrier-strainmeter assembly, which was to be cemented in the hole (Figure F6). The three hydraulic lines were encased in urethane within a singl e umbilical flatpack and broken out for termination at each of th e three downhole port locations. A swellable packer set above th e

screened casing interval provides hydraulic isolation between th e upper pressure port and the overlying ocean. Taken together, th e suite of instruments enables measurement of crustal deformatio n over a wide bandwidth $\mathrm{from}\ 0.01$ s to several months or longer ) with the high precision needed to detect earthquakes, microseismicity, low frequency earthquakes, and slow slip events.  

The locations of the sensors in the array were chosen on the basis of logging data from Expedition 319 and further guided by comparison with coring results from Site C0004 located $3.5~\mathrm{km}$ to th e east-northeast along strike (Screaton et al., 2009; Expedition 31 9 Scientists, 2010) (Figure F6). The lowermost pressure port is located within overridden slope sediments in the footwall of th e megasplay fault (logging Unit III). The strainmeter and instrumen t carrier are also installed within logging Unit III. The total thermistor string length is $175~\mathrm{m}$ , with the two uppermost nodes locate d within the screened casing interval, two more below the screene d interval, and the bottom node just above the instrument carrier.  

The completion string for the LTBMS was prepared by attachin g the sensors, cables, pressure ports, and hydraulic lines to $3\%$ inc h

with valves and the PSU were mounted (Figure F15). An ROV platform was attached to the wellhead prior to lowering the wellhea d into water. A titanium sphere data recorder and communication s unit with three UMC hoses connected to each downhole sensor wa s also installed on the ROV platform. At the time of initial assembly, the PSU began continuous recording to its stand-alone data logge r with a 1 min sampling interval. The hydraulic valves on the LTBM S head were set to connect the pressure gauges in the PSU to the overlying ocean but isolated from the formation hydraulic lines to avoi d potential damage to the sensors due to pressure fluctuations durin g landing and cementing operations. The other sensors were not recording at this time.  

Assembly was conducted in a LCA to avoid potential vibratio n and damage caused by lowering the string through the Kuroshi o Current. VIV was also suppressed by attaching ropes to the drill string while deploying and drifting (Kopf, Araki, Toczko, and th e Expedition 332 Scientists, 2011). Additionally, newly develope d moonpool equipment, including guide rollers and completion guid e rollers, were used to more efficiently and smoothly attach the hydraulic umbilical and cables (guide roller) and ropes (completio n guide roller). Throughout the deployment sequence (i.e., string assembly, lowering, drifting, reentry, landing, and cementing), a serie s of communication tests were conducted with the borehole instruments to verify sensor and cable function.  

After landing the LTBMS, we initialized the data recorder t o start data acquisition for the tilt combo package and strainmeter. The ROV maintained a connection to the data recorder at this tim e to monitor the status of the sensors during cementing. Temperatur e records during this period document cooling of the borehole due t o circulation. Pressure recorded at the strainmeter port indicates  a pressure increase of ${\sim}0.7\;\mathrm{MPa}$ during cementing, indicating that 7 8 m of seawater above the pressure sensor was displaced by th e denser cement. After cementing was complete, the hydraulic valve s at the LTBMS head were turned to connect the pressure gauges t o the formation hydraulic lines, and initial pressure data spanning th e descent through the water column and LTBMS head landing wer e downloaded by the ROV. The PSU logger memory was then cleared, and valve configurations and positions of all instruments installe d on the ROV platform were checked by visual inspection prior t o leaving the site.  

# Coring  

Coring operations were conducted in four holes: C0010B– C0010D, located within $30\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and offset along strike from Hol e C0010A, and Hole C0010E, offset $95\mathrm{~m~}$ to the south-southeast i n the updip direction where the thrust wedge is thinner and th e megasplay fault is shallower (Figures F1A, F3). Because coring operations were not anticipated and were not part of the primary expedition plan, the shipboard laboratory technicians and scienc e party were not staffed to split, describe, or sample cores. For thi s reason, whole (unsplit) cores were sampled for headspace gas analyses and immediately scanned with $\mathrm{X}{}_{\cdot}$ -ray computed tomography t o identify candidate intervals for time-sensitive whole-round sampling. After taking whole-round samples for interstitial water an d microbiology, the cores were run through the whole-round multisensor core logger and then refrigerated. All further shipboard analyses and sampling were deferred until a sampling party conducte d on the Chikyu while in port in Shimizu, Japan, from 25 July to 5 August 2016.  

Coring in Holes C0010C and C0010D recovered fractured silt y claystone from depths corresponding to the hanging wall of th e megasplay $(<\!400\,\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) and in the age range 3.79–5.59 Ma. Cor e samples collected from Hole C0010E span the interval from 360 t o 391 mbsf and primarily recovered clayey siltstones from the footwall of the fault, with ages from 1.56 to 1.67 Ma (Figure F18). Th e hanging wall to the megasplay fault (Holes C0010C and C0010D) i s dominated by indurated, gray to greenish gray silty claystone. Th e silty claystone is mottled by bioturbation where intact but more typically overprinted by deformation and coring disturbance, wit h many intervals of dense fractures and drill breccia. Subordinat e lithologies include thin beds of gray vitric ash. The ash is locally entrained along fractures and faults. This unit also contains interval s of sedimentary breccia with subrounded to subangular clasts of remobilized mudstone supported by a mudstone matrix. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data show high percentages of total clay mineral s relative to quartz and feldspar.  

The footwall to the megasplay fault contains olive-gray claye y siltstone that is weakly indurated and consistently coarser graine d than strata in the hanging wall. Bioturbation and faint laminae ar e widespread. Thin interbeds of dark gray silt are common, typicall y with sharp bases, normal size grading, and plane-parallel laminae. Thin interbeds of light to medium gray vitric ash are also common. Some intervals in the footwall display contorted soft-sediment deformation, with highly variable dips to laminae, clasts of remobilized mudstone, and pebble- to granule-sized lithic fragments an d pumice supported by a matrix of silty claystone. XRD data sho w consistent increases in the relative percentages of quartz and feldspar relative to the hanging wall.  

Bedding in Holes C0010C and C0010D, in the hanging wall o f the megasplay fault, is near horizontal or gently dipping from 300 t o  

Figure F18. Generalized stratigraphic columns for Holes C0010C and C0010 D (hanging wall) and Hole C0010E (footwall).

${\sim}350$ mbsf. Dips steepen and are up to $50^{\circ}{-}60^{\circ}$ in the ${\sim}50\;\mathrm{m}$ abov e the fault, likely related to deformation caused by slip on the megasplay. Faults and shear zones in the hanging wall also dip moderately. High-angle faults, one of which is identified as a reverse fault, are only observed at ${\sim}375$ mbsf. Bedding in Hole C0010E in th e footwall of the fault is horizontal or gently dipping; unlike the hanging wall, low-angle $(<\!30^{\circ})$ anastomosing shear zones are common i n the footwall cores.  

Porosity within the hanging wall ranges from $40\%$ to $50\%$ an d averages ${\sim}42\%$ (Figure F19). Although scattered, there is a distinc t increase in porosity in the footwall cored in Hole C0010E, with values ranging from $45\%$ to $50\%$ and averaging $48\%$ . $P$ -wave velocity i n all orientations increases gradually with depth in the hanging wall i n Holes C0010C and C0010D from $\mathord{\sim}1900$ to ${\sim}2000\ \mathrm{m/s}$ in the interval 300–395 mbsf. In the footwall (Hole C0010E), $P$ -wave velocity i s nearly constant with depth at ${\sim}1880~\mathrm{m/s}$ . Average thermal conductivities are 1.37, 1.47, and $1.3\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\mathrm{{\cdotK}})$ for Holes C0010C, C0010D, and C0010E, respectively. In general, thermal conductivity in th e hanging wall is higher than in the footwall. The higher $P$ -wave velocity and thermal conductivity in the hanging wall relative to th e footwall is consistent with its lower porosity.

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 365 achieved its two primary scientific and operational objectives, including (1) recovery of the GeniusPlug temporary monitoring system with a ${>}5$ y record of pressure an d temperature conditions within the shallow megasplay fault zone, geochemical samples, and an in situ microbial colonization experiment (Figures F8, F9) and (2) installation of a permanent LTBM S with a suite of instruments to monitor seismicity, deformation, an d hydrogeological processes. The complex LTBMS sensor array, i n combination with the multilevel hole completion, is one of the mos t ambitious and sophisticated observatory installations in scientifi c ocean drilling (similar to that in Hole C0002G, deployed in 2010). Additional operational challenges to deployment of the observator y string are presented by the $2500\,\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth and the stron g Kuroshio Current (reaching speeds ${>}5$ kt during the expedition). Overall, the installation went smoothly, efficiently, and ahead o f schedule. The extra time afforded by the efficient observatory deployment was used for coring at Site C0010. Despite challengin g hole conditions, the depth interval corresponding to the screene d casing across the megasplay fault was successfully sampled in Hol e C0010C, and the footwall of the megasplay was sampled in Hol e C0010E, with ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ recovery for both zones. Taken together wit h promising initial results from the GeniusPlug, this represents a clea r success in meeting—and exceeding—Expedition 365 objectives.  

Notably, many of the previous problems related to running complex observatory arrays in the Kuroshio Current have been successfully mitigated. During deployment “dummy runs” in this are a during Expedition 319, VIV of the drill pipe in the water colum n caused extensive damage to sensors and led to the loss of instruments (Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010). During the most recen t NanTroSEIZE LTBMS installation during Expedition 332 (Hol e C0002G), VIV was mitigated with the use of ropes attached to th e upper portion of the drill pipe, which reduced vibration by disrupting the flow of water around the pipe and prevented the formatio n of a low-pressure region behind (downstream of) the pipe. However, attachment of ropes, umbilical flatpack, and cables to the pip e still presents an operational challenge and requires considerabl e time because the lines need to be gathered and strapped to the pip e every $\sim\!2\textrm{m}$ . During Expedition 365, newly developed moonpool equipment, including a guide roller and completion guide roller, vastly increased efficiency and safety by providing guides to alig n the umbilical and cables (guide roller) and ropes (completion guid e roller) for attachment to the pipe as it was lowered through th e moonpool. We attribute much of the operation’s success during th e expedition to these advances. The increased efficiency afforded extra days for science operations; as a result, we were able to collec t core samples that will provide valuable data to aid in interpretatio n of the observatory data. The increased efficiency also minimize d the time spent suspending sensitive instrumentation in the wate r column, which in turn minimized the risk of damage due to heav e and vibration in the current.  

Initial analysis of the GeniusPlug pressure, temperature, chemical, and microbiological experiments has provided promising results. Coring of the thrust wedge immediately above the megaspla y fault has yielded key samples for postexpedition analyses and fo r comparison of pore fluid geochemistry with that sampled by th e GeniusPlug. The key outcomes of the expedition include  

• Complete recovery of continuous pressure and temperature records from the GeniusPlug, which include high-quality records of formation and seafloor responses to multiple fault slip events, including the 2011 Tohoku M9 earthquake (Figure F11), the 1 April 2016 Mie-Ken Nanto-oki M6 earthquake (Figure F12), and additional tentatively identified slip events associated with VLF earthquakes (one possibly triggered by the Tohoku earthquake and another in October 2015) (Tobin, Hirose, Saffer, Toczko, Maeda, Kubo, and the Expedition 348 Scientists, 2015);   
• Recovery of the FLOCS unit and geochemical sampling coils and successful cultivation of microbes from the FLOCS unit (Figure F14);   
• Successful deployment of the LTBMS string and completion of the hole (Figure F6); and   
• Coring in the deepest part of the thrust wedge above the megasplay fault (Holes C0010C and C0010D) and into the footwall of the fault (Hole C0010E), with $>\!50\%$ recovery of the formation; these samples provide valuable context for formation physical properties and interstitial water geochemistry and will greatly enhance interpretation of the GeniusPlug and LTBMS data sets.  

The GeniusPlug record of the Mie-ken Nanto-oki earthquak e documents a positive offset in pressure following the event, indicating compressional strain, and is consistent with observations fro m the previously installed LTBMS in Hole C0002G. This is importan t because together these data can uniquely distinguish between th e two potential focal mechanisms identified by seismological data ( a steeply southeast-dipping nodal plane vs. a shallow northwest-dipping one) and provide key evidence supporting a thrusting event either within the accretionary wedge or at the plate interface (Wallac e et al., 2016). We anticipate that future analysis of other earthquake s in the pressure record will produce similar insights.  

The GeniusPlug chemistry coils provide fluid samples that are, to first order, consistent with interstitial pore fluids collected acros s the megathrust at nearby Site C0004 (Screaton et al., 2009). However, loss of substantial fluid during recovery (possibly related to ga s exsolution and expansion in the coils) in combination with crackin g of the membranes for the chemical sampling coils preclude a detailed analysis of the time series data. One reason for the larg e amount of gas, in particular when compared to earlier FLOCS deployments in oceanic crust, may be the fact that microbial metabolism rates were enhanced in this sedimentary setting with Sit e C0004 sediment as substrate. Additional targeted analysis of samples and review of the data postexpedition may provide further insights. Care should be taken in future deployments to develop  a mechanism to seal the sampling coils and to improve access to th e coils on the rig floor to prevent depressurization and/or minimiz e fluid loss during recovery and transport of the coils to the shipboar d laboratories.  

The second primary objective of Expedition 365 was to install  a permanent LTBMS (Figures F6, F15, F16, F17). This was completed successfully and ahead of schedule. All observatory components were tested at several stages before, during, and after reentr y and final deployment. These tests verify that all cables, data transmission, and instruments were not damaged during the deploymen t procedure and were functioning at the time of cementing and hol e completion. After Expedition 365, the LTBMS, including multileve l pressure sensors and the full suite of geodetic and seismological instruments, was connected successfully to DONET during a Japa n Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology cruise on 19 Jun e 2016. From that time onward, power has been supplied by the cabled network and the data sampling rate for pressure was increase d from $60\,{\mathfrak{s}}$ to $_{1\,s}$ .  

In addition to accomplishing the planned expedition objective s noted above, efficient observatory operations afforded contingenc y time that was used to core the hanging wall and footwall of th e megasplay fault and recover materials representative of the formation where observatory instruments are placed at Site C0010 (Figure F4). The hanging wall is characterized by fractured claystones, whereas the footwall is characterized by less intensely deformed an d slightly coarser grained overridden slope apron deposits. These siltstones are similar to those cored at Sites C0001 and C0004 (Figure s F18, F19) with some key differences, notably: (1) the hanging wal l at Site C0010 has slightly lower porosity and higher $P$ -wave velocit y than the hanging wall at Site C0004, consistent with differences i n LWD data sets between the two sites and suggesting that the thrus t wedge at Site C0010 is slightly more consolidated and/or clay ric h than its counterpart along strike; (2) higher calcite content (up to 1 5 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) indicative of deeper environment of deposition closer to th e carbonate compensation depth (CCD); and (3) thinner mass transport deposits.  

Overall, the expedition was a clear success. All of the scientifi c and operational goals were achieved and completed well ahead o f schedule, allowing for ${\sim}5$ days of contingency operations that included coring at Site C0010. This is noteworthy because the site s had been logged with LWD during Expedition 319 at the time th e casing was emplaced (Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010) but had no t yet been cored. Collection of samples will provide key constraint s on rock properties and provide valuable context (i.e., pore fluid geochemistry and physical properties) for interpretation of LTBMS an d GeniusPlug data. For the earthquake events analyzed in our preliminary review of the data set, the borehole measurements, togethe r with data from the previously installed borehole observatory i n Hole C0002G, provide important and unique constraints on bot h slow earthquakes and the details of rupture in the Mie-ken Nantooki earthquake (e.g., Wallace et al., 2016). These examples underscore the essential value of borehole observatories in understandin g earthquake and tsunami processes through monitoring in borehole s that place instruments nearby, within, and directly above the earthquake-generating faults.
