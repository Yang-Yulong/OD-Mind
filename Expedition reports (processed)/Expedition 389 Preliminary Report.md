# Abstract  

Our understanding of the mechanisms controlling eustatic sea level and global climate change s has been hampered by a lack of appropriate fossil coral records over the last $500\;\mathrm{ky},$ particularl y into and out of the glacial periods. This problem was addressed by International Ocean Discover y Program Expedition 389 by drilling a unique succession of Hawaiian drowned coral reefs now a t 110–1300 meters below sea level (mbsl). The four objectives are to investigate (1) the timing, rate, and amplitude of sea level variability to examine cryosphere and geophysical processes, includin g the assessment of abrupt sea level change events; (2) the processes that determine changes i n mean and high-frequency (seasonal–interannual) climate variability from times with differen t boundary conditions (e.g., ice sheet size, $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2},$ and solar forcing); (3) the response of coral ree f systems to abrupt sea level and climate changes; and (4) the variation through space and time o f the subsidence and the volcanic evolution of the island. To achieve these objectives, 35 holes at 1 6 sites ranging 131.9–1241.8 mbsl were drilled during the expedition. A total of $425\mathrm{~m~}$ of core wa s recovered, comprising reef $(83\%)$ and volcanic $(17\%)$ material. Average core recoveries were $66\%$ , with numerous intervals characterized by very well preserved mixtures of coralgal and microbialite frameworks with recoveries ${>}90\%$ . Some science-critical shallow sites were not drilled due to  a failure to secure permits to operate in Hawaiian state waters. Furthermore, apart from one site th e target penetration depths were not achieved. Preliminary radiometric dates indicate that th e recovered reef deposits are from 488 to $13\mathrm{~ka}$ in age. The Onshore Science Party took place i n February 2024. Cores were CT and hyperspectral scanned and described. Standard measurement s were made, and samples were taken for postcruise research. Preliminary assessment of the age an d quality of the reef and basalt cores suggest that many of the expedition objectives will be met.  

# Plain language summary  

Shallow marine corals are highly sensitive to sea level and global climate change and preserve  a reliable record of past sea level and climate conditions. Knowledge of sea level and global climat e variations over the past half a million years is severely limited because of a lack of continuous fossi l coral records over this time. To address the critical need for coral records, this project focuses o n the submerged fossil reefs around the island of Hawai’i. Frequent and large volcanic eruption s formed and continue to grow the island of Hawai’i, and the island and surrounding shallow cora l reefs are pushed down at a rapid and nearly constant rate because of the weight of the volcani c rock erupted onto the land. As the land and coral reefs subside, coral reef growth can match th e subsidence rate, and changes in sea level and global climate are preserved in a unique and nearcontinuous fossil coral record covering the last half a million years. Scientific drilling of these reef s will provide a new record of climate and sea level change, including several key time periods wher e sea level and climate conditions are poorly known. The project has four major scientific objectives: (1) to measure the extent of sea level change over the past half a million years, (2) to investigat e why sea level and climate change through time, (3) to investigate how coral reefs respond to abrup t sea level and climate changes, and (4) to improve scientific knowledge of the growth and subsidence of Hawai’i over time. Expedition 389 drilled 35 holes at 16 sites ranging from 131.9 to 1241. 8 meters below sea level, recovering 425 meters of core, including very well-preserved mixtures o f coralgal and microbialite reef frameworks as well as interlayered and basement volcanic rocks. Preliminary observations and radiometric data confirm that these deposits span the past ${\sim}500{,}000$ years, including numerous key periods of major global ice sheet and sea level instability.  

# 1. Introduction  

Drowned coral reefs on rapidly subsiding margins (e.g., Hawai’i [USA] and Papua New Guinea ) contain a unique and largely unexploited archive of sea level and climate changes (Webster et al., 2007, 2009; Hibbert et al., 2016). Depending on the relationship between eustatic sea level change s and reef growth, the rapid subsidence ensures that these settings have the unique potential to continually create accommodation space, thus generating greatly expanded stratigraphic section s compared to reefs from stable and uplifting margins (Figure F1a). Moreover, these drowned reef s evolved mainly during different periods of Earth’s sea level and climate cycles (i.e., glacial periods ) that are not well sampled by reefs at stable and uplifting margins (Woodroffe and Webster, 2014). Our understanding of the mechanisms that control abrupt climate change and eustatic an d regional sea level change is significantly hampered by a lack of appropriate fossil coral records ove r the last $500\,\mathrm{ky},$ , particularly during the transitions into, during, and out of the glacial periods (Lambeck et al., 2002). Crucial new coral reef data are needed to directly constrain the timing, rate, an d amplitude of sea level variability during not only the last glacial cycle, where the data are still controversial (e.g., Woodroffe and Webster, 2014; Yokoyama et al., 2018, 2022), but also over the las t 500 ky. Such data will address climatic and cryospheric processes and assess controversial abrup t sea level events (i.e., meltwater pulses) that occur on suborbital frequencies (Chappell, 2002; Thompson and Goldstein, 2005; Yokoyama et al., 2001). Identification of the factors and processe s that control annual average global climate and seasonal and interannual climate variability in th e subtropical Pacific is of equal importance. Theories of how regional oceanography and hydroclimate respond to external forcing and/or are a result of internal sources of variability are primaril y derived from models or analyses of instrumental records and are generally limited to the last century, when only small changes in mean climate occurred (e.g., Dai et al., 2015; Kavanaugh et al., 2018). Earth history over the last $500~\mathrm{ky}$ reveals that the “dynamic range” of climate change i s much larger than in the instrumental record and that high-frequency global and regional climat e sensitivity to external forcing is dependent on mean state (Köhler et al., 2018). Prime tests of thes e theories require paleoclimate records (particularly seasonal-resolved fossil coral archives) fro m times when climate forcing, such as $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ and solar insolation, were different than today.

# 2. Background  

# 2.1. Hawaiian reefs  

The Hawaiian fossil coral reefs grew and drowned episodically over the last $500~\mathrm{ky}$ and offer  a unique opportunity to address major scientific problems. Hawai’i represents the ideal study location for three main reasons (Webster et al., 2009). First, there is rapid subsidence due to flexure o f the oceanic lithosphere from loading of the growing volcanoes, which in turn is controlled by rheology of the lithosphere and mantle (Watts, 1978); this process creates accommodation space tha t results in expanded reef sections, in contrast to convergent margins (e.g., Barbados and Papu a New Guinea) and passive margins (e.g., the Great Barrier Reef), where most existing fossil ree f records are derived (Figure F1a). Short-term fluctuations in volcanic loading are averaged out, an d thus subsidence rate is nearly uniform at $2.5{-}2.6\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{ky}$ over tens to hundreds of thousands of year s (Webster et al., 2009; Puga-Bernabéu et al., 2016). The depths of the sequence of drowned reefs of f shore Hawai’i (Figure F1b) fits the timing of the last six interglacials only if the subsidence rat e remained nearly constant for the last $500\;\mathrm{ky}.$ . Second, Hawai’i is uniquely situated; it is well awa y from the confounding influence of large ice sheets and boundary ocean currents that migh t obscure the sea level, and it fills a large geographical data gap because the abyssal seafloor in th e subtropical Pacific Ocean is generally too deep to preserve carbonate-rich sediment for subtropical climate variability reconstructions. Third, an extensive database of bathymetry, submersibl e and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) observations, and sedimentary and radiometric data confirm that the drowned reefs are highly sensitive to abrupt changes in sea level and climate. Thi s wealth of site survey information was used to plan Expedition 389 operations.  

# 2.2. Conceptual and numerical model of reef evolution in response to rapid subsidence  

The relationships between reef initiation, subsidence of the basement, eustatic sea level changes, and reef growth during changes in accommodation space can be modeled (Figure F1c). Previou s work on Hawai’i (Ludwig et al., 1991; Moore and Fornari, 1984) and Papua New Guinea (Galewsk y et al., 1996; Webster et al., 2004b, 2004c) proposed that reef growth initiates during stable sea leve l highstands and continues throughout the regression, with final drowning during the early part o f the deglaciations, perhaps because of abrupt eustatic sea level rise associated with meltwater puls e events (Webster et al., 2004a; Sanborn et al., 2017). Depending on the rate and magnitude of thes e parameters and reef response, the reef experiences repeated periods of shallow and deep wate r accretion, brief subaerial exposure, and drowning events, forming a complex “layer cake” stratigraphic succession composed of shallow to deep reef packages, separated by subaerial exposur e horizons and drowning unconformities. As a direct result of Hawai’i’s rapid but nearly constan t subsidence, a thick $(100{-}150\,\mathrm{~m~})$ expanded sequence of shallow coral reef–dominated facie s should be preserved in the Hawaiian reefs that are either unrepresented or a highly condense d sequence on stable (e.g., Great Barrier Reef [Webster and Davies, 2003; Humblet and Webster, 2017]) and uplifted margins (e.g., Papua New Guinea [Lambeck and Chappell, 2001] and Barbado s [Schellmann and Radtke, 2004]) because of a lack of continual creation of accommodation spac e and unfavorable shelf morphology (Woodroffe and Webster 2014). Webster et al. (2007) combine d observational data and numerical modeling techniques to simulate the stratigraphic evolution o f the two shallowest Hawaiian drowned reefs (H1 and H2), showing that although experiencing subaerial exposure, the interior coral reef deposits (i.e., those deposits retrieved by drilling) are les s likely to be diagenetically altered when compared with their stable and uplifted fossil reef counterparts given the brevity $(<5\mathrm{~ky})$ of each subaerial exposure event. The data also suggests that th e final reef units, marking the final drowning, were unlikely to be subaerially exposed given the rat e of subsidence and eustatic sea level rise during the penultimate and last deglaciations (Webster e t al., $2004{\mathrm{a}}$ ; Sanborn et al., 2017). Therefore, reef material recovered from the reef interior, and certainly the last phase of growth, should yield precise radiometric ages and geochemical climat e proxies providing critical information about the timing, rate, and amplitude of eustatic sea leve l changes and associated climate variability of the two last glacial periods (Webster et al., 2009) an d based on site survey data, the last five or six glacial periods (Figure F2).  

# 2.3. Reef terraces: distribution, morphology, and age data  

Based on compiled bathymetric data sets (Figure F3) (from MBARI Mapping Team [2000] an d Smith et al. [2002]), we identified 13 major (designated H0–H12 from shallowest to deepest [H i s for Hawai’i]) and 9 minor reef terraces (designated with suffixes a, b, c, etc.) around Hawai’i an d initially selected 11 primary and 9 alternate drilling targets (Figures F4, F5, F6, F7). In many cases, the depth of the break-in-slope of a continuous terrace varies because of variable subsidence tha t produces tilting and secondary retreat due to erosional processes. Detailed summaries of the published reef terrace distribution, morphology, and age data are found in the following studies: Webster et al. (2009), Puga-Bernabéu et al. (2016), Sanborn et al. (2017), and Taylor (2019). Here w e provide a summary of the site survey data and site selection process.

# 2.4. Site survey data  

The assembled site survey data set used to select the drilling sites represents work by many institutions and researchers over the last 40 y. High-resolution swath bathymetry and backscatter, i n combination with ROV/submersible and dredge data from proposed drilling locations or adjacen t locations, were the primary data sets used to define the extent and characteristics of the fossil reef s and select the proposed drill sites (Figures F4, F5, F6, F7; see the Scientific Prospectus [Webster e t al., 2023]). Swath bathymetric data were collected in 1998 with a $30\,\mathrm{kHz}$ Simrad EM300 system b y the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) on the Kohala Terrace (named by Campbell, 1986) and the northeast margin of Kohala Volcano (Clague et al., 1998; MBARI Mappin g Team, 2000) and by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) offshore Hilo (Dartnell and Gardner, 1999). These data are much higher resolution and have superior navigation to all previou s surveys, and they form the primary data used for site selection. In addition to the new $30\,\mathrm{kHz}$ data, Sea-Beam swath bathymetry was collected during a series of cruises by the Japan Agency fo r Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) starting in 1998 (Smith et al., 2002). Additional swath data has been collected by the University of Hawai’i and the National Oceanic an d Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Mapping Group. All data were used to define the exten t and characteristics of the reefs and select drill sites. Several air gun lines crossing the terraces wer e collected during the GLORIA surveys (USGS Cruise F6-86-HW) in 1986.

A great deal of work has already been done to sample and observe the reefs around Hawai’i, starting in 1983 with Makali’i submersible dives (M288–M298) (Figure F5), mainly on Reef H1d bu t also one dive on Reef H2c off Kohala (Dive M287) (Figure F7). In 1985, Pisces V submersible dive s (P5-65 through P5-78) explored and sampled many of the reefs off the Kona coast. Dredging programs were undertaken from the R/V Melville in 1987 (RTE87-D7 through RTE87-D9) and 200 5 (TUIM-MV-D1 through TUIM-MV-D4) and from the R/V Farnella in 1988 (F2-88-HW-D1 8 through F2-88-HW- D25) and 1991 (F2-91-HW-D2) on the northeast Reef H2d on Mauna Kea. One additional Pisces V dive (P5-407) and two ROV dives (RCV25 and RCV26) in 1999 took plac e on the terraces east of Kohala (Figure F7). A total of 7 Pisces IV dives (P4-165 through P5-171) an d video transects during 13 RCV-150 ROV dives (RCV334–RCV346) were conducted on the reef s offshore Hilo (Figure F6). The Hawai’i Undersea Research Laboratory has also conducted at leas t 100 additional submersible dives and ROV video transects on these reefs for fishery and othe r biological studies. In total, over 550 samples of reef carbonate collected during these operation s have been examined.  

In 2001, MBARI’s ROV Tiburon completed 14 dives on the reefs southwest of Kohala (T275–T279, T282–TT288, and T291–T293) and 5 dives on the reefs and canyons east of Kohala (T301, T302, and T304–T306) (Figure F7). One of these dives (T301) provided observations of a reef interio r stratigraphy that represents reef initiation, growth, and drowning. At this location, ROV samplin g at the base and top of this exposed section, combined with detailed observations, reveals at leas t six distinct reef units. These are characterized by different in situ coral volumes and framewor k types that are separated in places by planar surfaces, perhaps representing either thick corallin e algal crusts and/or subaerial exposure surfaces. U-series dating of two coral samples from near th e base of this reef yield ages of 377–392 ka (Webster et al., 2009), indicating this reef likely gre w during Marine Isotope Stages (MISs) 10 and 11 (Figure F8).

# 3. Scientific objectives  

The scientific objectives for Expedition 389 directly address key International Ocean Discover y Program (IODP) strategic objectives to investigate the mechanisms that control rapid climat e change and the relationship between changes in mean climate state and high-frequency (seasonal–decadal) climate variability. Specifically, it is directly aligned with the Earth’s Climate System, Feedbacks in the Earth System, and Tipping Points in Earth’s History Objectives of the 205 0 Science Framework of IODP. The specific objectives of the project are as follows.  

# 3.1. Objective 1: to define the nature of sea level change in the central Pacific over the last 500 ky  

We aim to reconstruct the most complete and detailed sea level record from fossil corals, particularly into, during, and out of the glacial periods. These data will allow more detailed testing of th e sensitivity and vulnerability of ice sheet responses to orbital to millennial-scale climate change.  A sea level curve will be built using absolute radiometric dating methods ( $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ accelerator mass spectrometry [AMS] ${<}50$ ka and U/Th) of in situ corals and coralline algae, paleobathymetric data, an d published and directly calculated subsidence rates for Hawai’i.  

# 3.2. Objective 2: to reconstruct paleoclimate variability for the last 500 ky and establish the relationship between the mean climate state and seasonal–interannual variability  

We aim to use coral-derived temperature and precipitation records to investigate how high-latitude climate (e.g., ice sheet size), atmospheric ${\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ levels, and mean and seasonal solar radiatio n impact Hawaiian climate, including storminess and the position of the Intertropical Convergenc e Zone. In combination with theoretical studies of subtropical climate change, these records wil l allow for the identification and study of critical processes that determine Pacific-wide climate.  

# 3.3. Objective 3: to establish the geologic and biological response of coral reef systems to abrupt sea level and climate changes  

We aim to reconstruct the detailed stratigraphic, geomorphic, and paleoenvironmental evolutio n of each reef in response to abrupt sea level and climate changes; test ecological theories abou t coral reef resilience and vulnerability to past and future climate changes by assessing the natur e and rate of change in reef communities within and between successive reefs over interglacial–millennial timescales; and establish the nature of living and ancient microbial communities in th e reefs and their role in reef building.  

# 3.4. Objective 4: to elucidate the subsidence and volcanic history of Hawai’i  

We aim to refine the variation through space and time of the subsidence of Hawai’i and contribut e to understanding the volcanic evolution of the island. The key to these objectives is to obtain welldated volcanic samples from the base of each hole and interbedded within or draping over th e reefs.  

# 4. Operational strategy  

# 4.1. Site selection and locations  

A total of 11 primary sites and 9 alternate sites were originally selected (Figures F3, F4, F5, F6, F7), located in water depths ranging approximately 129–1234 meters below sea level (mbsl) with maximum penetration depths of ${\le}110$ meters below seafloor (mbsf). Although most of the origina l primary and some alternate sites were drilled during Expedition 389, the site selection and drillin g strategy changed after the expedition was underway because of three main factors. First, PROD5, the seabed drilling system, was unable to reach the planned penetration depths at all but one site. Thus, the strategy was adjusted to drill more shallow penetration holes $(20{-}40\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ at severa l sites, and, additionally, IODP Environmental Protection and Safety Panel (EPSP) and Europea n Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) Facility Board (EFB) approval was obtained t o drill a new site during the expedition (Site M0107). Second, because Expedition 389 was unable t o secure permission to operate in state waters, the three primary science-critical sites (in th e Kawaihae, Kona, and Hilo regions) located on the H1 terrace could not be drilled; as a consequence, IODP panel approval was also obtained during the expedition to drill new sites (M0099, M0106, and M0110) on the H1 terrace not in state waters, even though they are not ideally locate d to meet some important scientific objectives. Third, based on observations of reef material recovered early during the expedition at Site M0097, it appeared that moving drill sites closer to th e seaward edge of the terrace would result in recovery of more submassive and massive fossil corals. Although the $150\;\mathrm{m}$ radius of each site target allowed for this flexibility at most sites, this was no t the case at proposed Site MAH-02A (Figure F7); thus, IODP panel approval was obtained durin g the expedition to drill a new site (M0108), located on the same terrace ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ south of Site MAH02A. IODP Expedition 389 sites (Figure F9; Table T1) are distributed across five regions aroun d the island of Hawai’i: Kawaihae (Figure F10), Mahukona (Figure F11), Kohala (Figure F12), Hil o (Figure F13), and Ka Lae (Figure F14).

# 5. Operations  

# 5.1. Offshore phase  

The drilling platform used for Expedition 389 was the dynamically positioned multipurpose vesse l MMA Valour ( $\,\!84\,\mathrm{m}$ long; 4258 tons), operated by MMA Offshore. A suite of containerized laboratories and offices were installed on the aft deck area. Coring operations were performed by Benthic’s fifth generation Portable Remotely Operated Drill (PROD) seafloor drill. PROD5 is rated t o a water depth of $4000\ \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , is unaffected by surface heave conditions, and consequently has goo d control on bit weight, increasing the likelihood of higher quality cores in shallow waters compare d to ship-mounted systems that rely on heave compensation.  

Rotary coring was the primary drilling method, recovering core with a diameter of $72\;\mathrm{mm}$ in 2.7 5 m sampling barrels. To give some flexibility during rotary coring operations, two different rotar y drill bits (diamond surface set and impregnated) were available. One $75~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter push cor e was attempted at Site M0101, recovering $_{6\,\textrm{c m}}$ of soft sediment in Hole M0101A (Core 389- M0101A-1P-1). A small number of wash bores were usually loaded to allow for advancement without coring or to clean the borehole of material that may have fallen to the bottom during core run s or setting casing. Two core liner types were available: aluminum and polycarbonate.  

PROD5 is self-contained with its own Launch and Recovery System (LARS), occupying a basi c deck footprint of $17.0\:\mathrm{m}\times8.0\:\mathrm{m}$ and is lowered to the seafloor on an umbilical cable. The computerized control system allows the corer to safely position on the seabed by moving above the se a bed using its onboard thruster and subsea cameras to ensure there are no obstacles and/or significant macro benthos on the selected landing site. Each of PROD5’s three legs can be independentl y adjusted to provide a level platform from which to deploy the core barrels. Upon confirmation of  a successful landing on site, the sound velocity profile gathered during deployment to the seafloo r was integrated to the ultra-short baseline (USBL) method as part of the process to determine th e coordinates of the center of gravity of PROD5. This method takes into account sound velocit y error, offset measurement, and pitch and roll corrections. Using the coordinates of the ship as  a reference, the latitude and longitude of the hole was calculated with an error of up to $1\%$ of th e water depth.  

Mobilization of the vessel took place in Barbers Point Harbor, Kapolei, on the island of O’ah u between 26 and 31 August 2023. ECORD Science Operator (ESO) staff boarded on August 26, an d the offshore science party participants joined on August 29. The MMA Valour set sail at $1750\,\mathrm{h}$ o n August 31, and the first leg of the offshore phase of the expedition continued to $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ on September 27 (Table T1), when the MMA Valour began transit back to Kapolei, arriving at $0630~\mathrm{h}$ o n September 28 for a ${\sim}25\ \mathrm{h}$ midexpedition port call for a crew and technician change, to load supplies, and to offload the reefer of core collected during Leg 1. The vessel began transit back to sit e for Leg 2 by $0700\,\mathrm{h}$ on September 29 and arrived on location at $0230\,\mathrm{h}$ on September 30.  

The offshore operational phase of Expedition 389 concluded at $2345\mathrm{~h~}$ on October 31 with th e transit back to Kapolei for demobilization. The MMA Valour arrived at port after $0600\mathrm{~h~}$ o n November 2, and the offshore scientists disembarked in the early afternoon. The remaining ES O containers and the second refrigerated core reefer containing Leg 2 cores, core catcher samples, and interstitial water splits were offloaded during demobilization for return shipping to final destinations. ESO staff disembarked the vessel on November 4 at the end of Expedition 389 demobilization.  

In total, 44.32 days of Expedition 389 were spent operational on station, 1.76 days were spent i n transit between sites or from port, 1.0 days were spent in port during the expedition, $14~\mathrm{{h}}$ wer e spent on standby at station because of vessel technical issues, 10.94 days were spent on equipment-related downtime, and $2.0~\mathrm{h}$ in a diversion to port for disembarkment of a contractor fo r medical reasons.  

As with the majority of IODP Mission Specific Platform expeditions, no cores were split durin g the offshore phase; therefore, a comprehensive onshore phase (the Onshore Science Party [OSP] )

# 5.2. Onshore Science Party  

Prior to the OSP, X-ray CT (XCT) scanning for Expedition 389 was conducted on the whole core s at the Core Scanning Facility (CSF) at the British Geological Survey in Keyworth, United Kingdom. The refrigerated core reefers were shipped from Hawai’i to the United Kingdom and wer e delivered in two shipments to the CSF, arriving on 2 January and 7 February 2024. Following XC T scanning, the core was then shipped to the BCR in four shipments for processing during the OSP, which took place between 6 and 26 February 2024 at the BCR located in the Center for Marin e Environmental Sciences (MARUM) building on the campus of Bremen University, Germany. Th e cores were split and described in detail, and IODP standard sampling and measurements an d postexpedition scientific research sampling were undertaken (Table T2).  

Further analytical laboratories were accessed by agreement with the Department of Geoscience s (geochemistry, paleomagnetism, and X-ray diffraction mineralogy) and MARUM (physical properties and nondestructive core logging) at Bremen University (Table T2). In addition to the IOD P standard suite of analyses performed during the OSP, hyperspectral data were acquired on al l archive halves using a SisuROCK drill-core scanner (Spectral Imaging Ltd., Oulu, Finland) to provide information on carbonate mineralogy and diagenetic alteration.  

# 6. Lithologic facies  

The combination of the overall lithology, major and minor components, and sedimentary boundaries show the fossil reefs around Hawai’i are composed of thirteen major lithologic facies (Figur e F15), defined as follows:  

• Fall-in material (F0). These deposits are reworked, brecciated material, possibly with recoring marks on some debris at the top of the core, different from the facies below.   
• Coralgal boundstone (F1). These deposits are mainly built (bound) by corals and encrusting coralline algae forming well-developed frameworks. Occasional vermetids and Homotrema within coralline algal crusts are present.   
• Coralgal-microbialite boundstone (F2). These deposits are formed by coral and coralline algae frameworks either capped by microbialites or with large cavities filled by microbialites. Occasional gastropods, echinoid spines, serpulid tubes, bivalves, vermetids, and Homotrema are present.   
• Microbialite boundstone (F3). These deposits are built mainly by microbialite frameworks with occasional coral and coralline algae crusts.   
• Microbialite-algal boundstone (F3.5). These deposits are characterized by a mixture of microbialite and algal boundstones forming well-developed frameworks.   
• Algal boundstone (F4). Massive coralline algal crusts forming well-developed frameworks, commonly associated with Homotrema and vermetids and with occasional thin corals.   
• Consolidated biodetrital (F5). These deposits are biodetrital grainstone or packstone with coral clasts, algal clasts, and various accessory bioclasts (bivalves, gastropods, echinoid spines, and large benthic foraminifers).   
• Unconsolidated biodetrital (F6). These deposits are biodetrital carbonate sands with coral clasts, algal clasts, large benthic foraminifers, gastropods, Halimeda clasts, and echinoid spines.   
• Hemipelagic/pelagic (no image). These mudstone/wackestones and are dominated by planktonic foraminfera, mollusks, small benthic foraminifers, abundant micrite, and minor volcaniclastic grains.   
• Volcaniclastic (F8). These deposits are mostly volcaniclastic sediments, with occasional coral clasts as well as large benthic foraminifers.   
• Basaltic volcanic rock (F9). This facies is characterized by a diverse suite of massive, vesicular, picritic, and brecciated basaltic rock types.   
• Mixed carbonate-volcaniclastic (F10. These deposits are a mixture of consolidated/unconsolidated carbonate-volcaniclastic sediments containing carbonate clasts of corals, algal clasts, Halimeda intraclasts, echinoid spines, gastropods, and large benthic foraminifers.   
• Rhodoliths rudstone/floatstone (F11). The deposits are either rudstone or floatstones and are dominated by coralline algae forming rhodoliths.

# 7. Site summaries  

# 7.1. Leeward side  

The northwest flank of Hawai’i represents the area of most intensive investigation over the last 4 0 y. Complete high-resolution bathymetry and backscatter data coverage, combined with extensiv e ROV and submersible observations and sampling, has revealed a succession of 12 well-develope d reef terraces. This area is divided into the proximal drill sites off shore, hereafter referred to as th e Kawaihae region (Figure F10), and the more distal drill sites off shore the western flank of th e submerged Mahukona Volcano (Clague and Moore, 1991; Moore and Clague, 1992), hereafte r referred to as the Mahukona region (Figure F11).  

# 7.1.1. Kawaihae sites  

The original sites on this H1 reef were located in Hawaiian state waters, so they were unavailabl e for drilling (proposed Sites KAW-01-3B, KON-01A, and HIL-01A). Sites M0099 and M0110 wer e selected and drilled because they intersect the major $150~\mathrm{{mbsl}}$ reef terrace (H1d) that can b e traced from the originally proposed sites and occur around much of the flanks of the island o f Hawai’i (Moore and Fornari, 1984; Webster et al., 2004a). They were drilled at water depth s between 132 and $157~\mathrm{m}$ . ROV observations and samples at these sites confirm their reefal nature. This terrace drowned about $14.7\;\mathrm{ka}$ (Webster et al., 2004a; Sanborn et al., 2017) and likely gre w during MISs 1–5 (Webster et al., 2009).  

The $400~\mathrm{{mbsl}}$ terrace forms a well-developed and continuous reef (H2d) off Kawaihae. This ree f has been extensively sampled and observed by submersible, and U/Th ages on corals range 133 t o approximately $170\;\mathrm{ka}$ (Webster et al., 2009). A series of holes $(414{-}424~\mathrm{mbsl})$ were drilled at Sit e M0097 at the seaward edge of the prominent terrace feature, and Site M0107 was drilled on  a shallower subterrace at 404 mbsl. Sites M0096 and M0100 were drilled to recover reefal materia l from deeper terraces off shore Kawaihae. However, Site M0096, located on the H4 terrace a t approximately $740~\mathrm{mbsl}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , and Site M0100, located on the H6 terrace at approximately $990~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , were only drilled to ${<}15$ mbsf and comprise basalt.  

# 7.1.1.1. Site M0096  

Site M0096 consists of four holes (M0096A, M0096C, M0096D, and M0096F) located on a terrac e at water depths of 736 to $741\;\mathrm{m}$ (Figures F10, F16). The first three holes primarily comprise mixe d carbonate-volcaniclastic sediments, bioclastic materials (including corals and coralline algae), an d large, subangular to subrounded volcanic clasts of variable crystallinity. In-place basalt was recovered at the base of Hole M0096D. The fourth hole (M0096F) consists entirely of in-place lava flow s with variable vesicularity and low crystallinity lava, and lava clinker common in subaeria l emplacement conditions.  

Multisensor core logger (MSCL) and other MSCL physical properties measurements indicat e some variability within the in-place basalt interval, but there are no apparent downhole trends.  

![](images/6551008904fbc5ab2c96a5fecfe4669fd830d4c730f62f4d75ee5312d4c64299.jpg)  
Figure F16. Kawaihae region cores and recovery for Sites M0096, M0097, M0099, M0100, M0107, and M0110, with site location maps overlain on a $10\;\mathsf{m}$ grid bathymetric map (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/bathymetry).  

One coral near the top of Hole M0096D was dated to $241.4\pm0.1$ ky BP. The date is consistent wit h the estimated age of the H4 terrace spanning MIS 8/9 (Ludwig et al., 1991; Webster et al., 2009).  

# 7.1.1.2. Site M0097  

Site M0097 consists of four holes located on a terrace at water depths of 414 to $424\mathrm{~m~}$ . Hole s M0097A and M0097B were drilled at a water depth of $414~\mathrm{m}$ , and Holes M0097C and M0097 D were drilled closer to the edge of the terrace in slightly deeper water at 424 mbsl. For all four hole s at Site M0097 (Figures F10, F16), a mixed carbonate-volcaniclastic coarse-grained deposit, up t o $1.81\textrm{m}$ thick, occurs at the top of the succession. Below, coralgal-microbialite boundstone wit h dominantly branching and columnar Porites extends down to about 13.00 mbsf (Holes M0097 A and M0097D) to 19.00 mbsf (Hole M0097C). Farther downhole, there are intervals of algal an d microbialite-algal boundstone with thick coralline algal crusts and few corals, mainly branchin g Porites, down to about 20.00 mbsf (Holes M0097A and M0097D) and to about 30.00 mbsf (Hol e M0097C). Below, coralgal-microbialite boundstone was recovered down to 58.42 mbsf; columna r Porites dominate in the upper part of this interval and branching Porites the lower.  

The MSCL and other physical properties data indicate some variability likely related to variation s in lithology, but there are no notable features and no apparent downhole trends.  

A total of seven U-Th dates were measured on samples from Site M0097; three of these sample s are rejected based on anomalous $\delta^{234}\mathrm{U}$ initial values or anomalously high $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ concentration. O f the remaining four samples, the dates span ${\sim}133{-}150$ ky BP with no stratigraphic age inversions, although the date at the base of Hole M0097B indicates some stratigraphic inconsistency. However, broadly these dates are consistent with the interpretation of the MIS $6/7$ age of this H2 terrace from prior studies (Webster et al., 2009).  

# 7.1.1.3. Site M0099  

Site M0099 consists of two subterraces, one at a water depth of ${\sim}132\;\mathrm{m}$ and another at $\mathord{\sim}147$ mbs l (Figures F10, F16). Holes M0099A–M0099C are located on the shallower subterrace and ar e directly comparable. Based on the main lithologic changes, discontinuity surfaces, and/or change s in physical properties, three main lithostratigraphic intervals are identified. The first interva l forms the uppermost 6 to $7\textrm{m}$ of each hole. The basal boundary of the first interval is a hardened, blackened, and bioeroded surface in Hole M0099A that corresponds to a major lithologic chang e in the two other holes. This interval is coralgal-microbialite boundstone in Holes M0099A an d M0099C but is dominated by microbialite-algal boundstone in Hole M0099B. The second interval, only present in Hole M0099C (7.05–21.60 mbsf) is dominated by microbialite-algal boundston e and is bounded at its base by a major facies change, also reflected in the physical propertie s data. The third interval, also present only in Hole M0099C (21.60–36.05 mbsf), is bounded at it s base by a hardened and bored surface. This interval is divided into two main lithologies: an uppe r algal boundstone that overlies a coralgal boundstone with a coarse-grained biodetrital matrix.  

Holes M0099E–M0099G are located on the lower ( $144{-}146\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth) subterrace. Fou r major lithostratigraphic intervals are identified. The first interval forms the uppermost 6 to $7\textrm{m}$ o f Holes M0099E and M0099F. The basal boundary of this interval is not marked by a distinct sedimentary structure, but a facies change occurs below. This interval is coralgal-microbialite boundstone in Hole M0099E but is composed of two lithologies in Hole M0099F: an upper alga l boundstone that overlies a coralgal boundstone. The second interval, observed in Hole M0099 E (5.86–15.15 mbsf) and Hole M0099F (7.08–12.97 mbsf) is dominated by microbialite-alga l boundstone and algal boundstone and is bounded at its base by a major facies change, as well as  a sharp change in physical properties. The third interval is present only in Hole M0099E (15.15– 31.50 mbsf) and can be divided into two main lithologies: an upper coralgal boundstone that overlies an alternation of algal boundstone and unconsolidated, coarse-grained biodetrital sediment. The recovered material from Hole M0099G consists only of the fourth interval (30.89–48.4 0 mbsf) which is mainly composed of coralgal boundstone and algal boundstone. The contact wit h the basaltic substratum defines the basal boundary of this interval. The basaltic material in th e lower parts of Hole M0099G represents coherent, in-place lava flows, hyaloclastite, and volcani c rubble, much of which is fresh and unaltered, although zones of substantial alteration occur i n both the coherent lava and the hyaloclastite. A significantly more phenocryst-rich lithology occur s in the lower sections of Hole M0099G.  

The physical properties data, particularly the MSCL natural gamma radiation (NGR) and densit y data, suggest that there is a marked change at around 25 mbsf in Hole M0099C and at around 1 5 mbsf in Hole M0099E that may correlate with major changes in lithologies (i.e., microbialite-alga l to boundstone in Hole M0099C and microbialite-algal to coralgal microbialite in Hole M0099E). The NGR values are relatively high and the density values are relatively low below these depth s compared to those above.  

A total of six samples for radiocarbon dates and seven samples for U-Th dates were measured o n samples from Site M0099; two of the U-Th dates are rejected based on anomalously high $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ concentrations. The radiocarbon dates and remaining five U-Th dates are in stratigraphic order an d are consistent with the interpretation of the age of the H1 terrace spanning MISs 1–5 (Ludwig e t al.,1991; Webster et al., 2009; Sanborn et al., 2017).  

# 7.1.1.4. Site M0100  

Site M0100 consists of one hole (M0100A) (Figures F10, F16) located at a water depth of $998~\mathrm{m}$ and was drilled to 12.43 mbsf. This hole comprises an upper portion of coralgal boundston e underlain by a volcanic sequence of in-place lavas, welded volcanic breccias, and volcaniclasti c sediments.  

The MSCL resistivity, density, and magnetic susceptibility data from Hole M0100A vary considerably and may correspond to changes in the physical properties and/or chemistry of the basalts.  

One U-Th date was obtained from a sample from Hole M0100A, yielding a date of $\mathord{\sim}329$ ky BP, which is consistent with the estimated MIS 9 age for the H6 terrace (Ludwig et al., 1991; Webste r et al., 2009 and references therein).  

# 7.1.1.5. Site M0107  

Site M0107 consists of one hole (M0107A) (Figures F10, F16) located at a water depth of $404~\mathrm{m}$ and was drilled to 13.05 mbsf. This site represents a shallower subterrace of the H2 terrace tha t was also drilled at Site M0097.  

Hole M0107A mostly recovered porphyritic basalt with high contents of olivine and clinopyroxen e in an unaltered microcrystalline matrix disrupted by intervals of carbonate crust or carbonate sediment infilling. The basalt is directly overlain by a thin coralgal boundstone ( $\operatorname{l0}\,\mathsf{c m}$ thick) that i n turn is capped by a conglomerate of mixed carbonate-volcaniclastic clasts.  

The MSCL resistivity, density, and magnetic susceptibility data from Hole M0107A have notabl e variability that may correspond to changes in the physical properties and/or chemistry of th e basalts.  

One U-Th date was measured on a sample from Hole M0107A, yielding a date of $\mathord{\sim}130$ ky BP. Thi s date is consistent with the estimated MIS 6/7 age of the H2 terrace (Ludwig et al., 1991; Webster e t al., 2007).  

# 7.1.1.6. Site M0110  

Site M0110 consists of two holes. Hole M0110A is located on the deeper subterrace at a wate r depth of 157 ms and Hole M0110B is located on the shallower subterrace at a water depth of 14 5 m (Figures F10, F16). The cored succession is divided into five lithologic intervals from top t o bottom in Hole M0110A: (1) loose rhodoliths, (2) coralgal-microbialite boundstone, (3) biodetrita l rudstone, (4) coralgal-microbialite boundstone, and (5) basalt. Intervals 1 and 2 are separate d from Intervals 3–5 by a major lithologic boundary at 4.37 mbsf in Hole M0110A, and Intervals  3 and 4 are absent in Hole M0110B.  

The MSCL NGR, density, and magnetic susceptibility data, as well as the $L^{\ast}$ data, from Hole s M0110A and M0110B have notable downhole trends that reflect the transition from reef materia l above to basalt below. Relative to the reef facies, the basalt has lower $L^{\ast}$ and higher NGR, density, and magnetic susceptibility, with notable variability that may correspond to changes in the physical properties and/or chemistry of the basalts.  

Four radiocarbon dates were obtained from Site M0110. The uncalibrated radiocarbon dates spa n ${\sim}35{-}12\mathrm{\ky\,^{14}C}\,^{1}$ BP and are consistent with the estimated age of the H1 terrace that spans MISs 1– 5 (Sanborn et al., 2017; Webster et al., 2009; Ludwig et al., 1991).  

# 7.1.2. Mahukona sites  

Sites M0098 and M0108 are located off shore the submerged Mahukona Volcano and intersec t perhaps the most prominent reef structure (H8) on the northwest flank of Hawai’i (Figure F11). This feature is divided into two subterraces; dive observations, samples, and dredges show tha t these robust features are both coral reefs (H8a and H8b) (Webster et al., 2009), and previous Useries dating of three corals yielded ages of 360, 406, and $475\,\mathrm{ka}$ (Ludwig et al., 1991). Site M009 8 penetrates the upper reef (H8a) at a water depth of $1100\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , and Site M0108 penetrates the lowe r reef (H8b) at a water depth of $1177\;\mathrm{m}.$ . At a water depth of $1242\;\mathrm{m}$ , M0109 penetrates the deepes t (H9) of the reefs sampled during Expedition 389.  

# 7.1.2.1. Site M0098  

At Site M0098, one hole was drilled at a water depth of $1100\;\mathrm{m}$ to 19.22 mbsf (Figures F11, F17). Based on the main lithologic changes and discontinuity surfaces, four main intervals are identified. Interval 1 consists of coralgal boundstone from 0 to 0.35 mbsf and is bounded at its base by  a major facies change. Interval 2 consists of unconsolidated sediments, coralgal boundstone, an d consolidated grainstone from 0.35 to 1.97 mbsf. This interval is bounded at its base by a majo r facies change. Interval 3 consists of coralgal boundstone from 1.97 to 11.04 mbsf and is bounde d at its base by another facies change. Interval 4 consists of coralgal-microbial boundstone fro m 11.04 to 19.22 mbsf.  

Because of poor recovery and drilling disturbance, there is only sparse physical properties dat a and there are no apparent downhole trends.  

![](images/8d09b43632ae822561ea75d886501d9369a278298f5184300004a59ca6fe24f0.jpg)

Two U-Th dates were measured on samples from Hole M0098A spanning ${\sim}410{-}421$ ky BP, whic h is consistent with the estimated age of the H8 terrace (Ludwig et al., 1991; Webster et al., 2009).  

# 7.1.2.2. Site M0108  

Site M0108 consists of two holes (M0108A and M0108B) located on the same subterrace at a wate r depth of $1178\;\mathrm{m}$ (Figures F11, F17). Based on the main lithologic changes, three main lithostratigraphic intervals are identified from top to bottom. The upper interval, spanning all of Hol e M0108A and 1.86 to 8.83 mbsf of Hole M0108B, is dominated by coralgal-microbialite boundstone and characterized by robust branching Porites. The second interval, recovered only in Hol e M0108B from 8.83 to 25.25 mbsf, is composed predominantly of highly fragmented coralga l boundstone embedded locally in a biodetrital matrix. The lower interval, from 25.25 mbsf to th e base of Hole M108B at 30.70 mbsf, consists mostly of an unconsolidated coarse-grained biodetrital sediment with abundant loose reworked large Porites and Montipora clasts, as well as crustos e coralline algal fragments.  

Because of poor recovery and drilling disturbance, there are only sparse physical properties dat a and no apparent downhole trends.  

Four samples were U-Th dated, but the topmost sample from Hole M0108A is rejected based o n an anomalously high $\delta^{234}\mathrm{U}$ concentration $(>4{\mathrm{~ppm}})$ and an anomalously high $\delta^{234}\mathrm{U}$ initial valu e $(>\!160\%_{0})$ . The remaining three samples are from Hole M0108B and provide dates spanning ${\sim}364-$ 472 ky BP, although the lower two samples reveal an age inversion. Overall, these dates are consistent with the timing of stratigraphically adjacent terrace development shown in Webster et al. (2009) and with the ages and depths of dated corals in Ludwig et al. (1991).  

# 7.1.2.3. Site M0109  

Site M0109 consists of one hole (M0109A) located at a water depth of $1241.8\mathrm{~m~}$ (Figures F11, F17). Below a thin interval of unconsolidated biodetrital sediment, Hole M0109A consists o f highly disturbed coralgal boundstone comprising mostly branching and columnar Porites wit h thin coralline algal crusts.  

Because of poor recovery and drilling disturbance, there are only sparse physical properties dat a and no apparent downhole trends.  

Two U-Th dates were obtained from Hole M0109A, but both are rejected based on anomalou s $\delta^{234}\mathrm{U}$ initial values (below $130\%_{00}$ or above $160\%_{\mathrm{{00}}}$ ), and one of the dates also has high uncertaint y due to being near secular equilibrium. Site M0109 is the deepest site drilled during Expeditio n 389, and thus presumably has the oldest reef material, which is close to the limit of U-Th dating.  

# 7.2. Windward side  

# 7.2.1. Kohala sites  

Two sites (M0101 and M0102) were drilled offshore Kohala on the northeast side of Hawai’i. Sit e M0101 intersects the prominent reef terrace (H7) at 930 mbsl that is well exposed by a submarin e plunge pool system (Webster et al., 2009) (Figure F12). Site M0102, selected on the basis of th e bathymetric/backscatter data, intersects the reef (H2d) at $410\;\mathrm{mbsl}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , also targeted on the leewar d side Kawaihae region (Site M0097) and at another windward location in the Hilo region (Site s M0103 and M0104).  

# 7.2.1.1. Site M0101  

Two holes were drilled at Site M0101 (Holes M0101A and M0101B) at water depths of ${\sim}932\;\mathrm{m}$ t o a total depth of 45 mbsf (Figures F12, F18). In both holes, core material consists, from top to bottom, of a $30{-}50~\mathrm{cm}$ thick interval of brecciated basalt, an interval of consolidated and unconsolidated bioclastic material extending to ${\sim}5$ mbsf, and a coralgal microbialite boundstone compose d predominantly of laminar and branching Porites with thin crustose coralline algal crusts overlai n by thin microbialite crusts. In Hole M0101B, beneath the coralgal microbialite boundstone at ${\sim}25$ mbsf, there is a ${\sim}3.5~\mathrm{m}$ thick layer of unconsolidated biodetrital sediment. Below that layer, basal t extends to the bottom of the hole at $\sim45$ mbsf.  

The MSCL NGR, density, and magnetic susceptibility data, as well as the $L^{\ast}$ data, from Site M010 1 show notable downhole trends that reflect the transition from reef material above to basalt below. Relative to the reef lithologies, the basalt has lower $L^{\ast}$ and NGR and higher density and magneti c susceptibility, and it has notable variability that may correspond to changes in the physical properties and/or chemistry of the basalts.  

A total of five U-Th dates were obtained for Site M0101. One date is rejected on the basis of anomalously high $\delta^{234}\mathrm{U}$ concentration. Replicates were run on one sample, which yielded the same dat e within the reported uncertainty. There is one age inversion between two samples. Overall, th e dates span ${\sim}365{-}434\ \mathrm{ky}$ BP, consistent with the estimated age of the H7 terrace (Ludwig et al., 1991; Webster et al., 2009).  

# 7.2.1.2. Site M0102  

Two holes were drilled to ${\sim}73$ mbsf at Site M0102 (Holes M0102A and M0102C) at water depth s of $413\mathrm{-}416\mathrm{\,m}$ (Figures F12, F18). Based on the main lithologic changes and discontinuity surfaces, four main lithostratigraphic intervals are identified. Interval 1 forms the major part of Hol e M0102A (0–22.25 mbsf) and consists of rhodolith floatstone embedded in unconsolidated biodetrital-volcaniclastic sediment. The basal boundary corresponds to a lithology change in bot h Holes M0102A and M0102C. Interval 2, recovered from 22.25 to 24.61 mbsf in Hole M0102A an d from 21.58 to 28.85 mbsf in Hole M0102C, is dominated by coralgal boundstone with submassiv e to massive Porites. At its base, it is bounded by a thin layer of consolidated, biodetrital, coarsegrained rudstone to grainstone. Interval 3 is a succession of coralgal microbialite boundstone fro m 29.25 to 70.69 mbsf in Hole M0102C (not recovered in Hole M0102A), with coral morphologie s and types changing downward from branching and platy Porites and columnar Pavona to predominantly very large massive Porites with rare laminar Pavona. Interval 4, from 70.69 to 72.71 mbsf i n Hole M0102C (not recovered in Hole M0102A), consists of coralgal boundstone with numerou s branching and platy Porites.

The MSCL NGR, density, and magnetic susceptibility data, as well as the $L^{*}$ data, at Site M0102 d o not have any apparent downhole trends, although there is a notable downhole increase in th e range of values in all these parameters below about 40 mbsf.  

Five U-Th dates were measured on samples from Site M0102 that span ${\sim}171{-}225\ \mathrm{ky}$ BP. None o f these dates was rejected on the basis of the U-Th geochemistry; however, there is one age inversion near the bottom of Hole M0102C. Overall, the dates from Site M0102 are consistent with th e timing of development of the H2 terrace spanning MIS 6/7 from Webster et al. (2009).  

# 7.2.2. Hilo sites  

Three sites (M0103–M0105) were drilled off shore Hilo on the east side of Hawai’i (Figure F13). Submersible dive observations and samples confirm that the targeted features are coral reefs tha t likely span MISs 1–5 and 6–7 (Puga-Bernabéu et al., 2016). Site M0103 targeted the ${\sim}400$ mbs l reef (H2d), which was also cored at Kawaihae (Site M0097) and Kohala (Site M0102). Site M010 4 was drilled at a shallower water depth of $347\;\mathrm{m}$ where high backscatter was mapped and carbonat e mounds (pinnacles) were described (Puga-Bernabéu et al., 2016). Finally, Site M0105 was drille d upslope from Site M0104 on a subterrace at a water depth of $340\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# 7.2.2.1. Site M0103  

Site M0103 consists of one hole (M0103A) located at a water depth of $405~\mathrm{m}$ (Figures F13, F19). Core material consists predominantly of pebble- to cobble-sized rhodoliths in the uppermos t $26.60\mathrm{~m~}$ of the hole. The lower part, below 26.60 mbsf, is mostly composed of unconsolidate d biodetrital sediment with foliaceous corals, including Leptoseris, down to 37.60 mbsf and up t o cobble-sized fragments of massive Porites below. At $42.20\;\mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , a contact with basalt breccia wa s recovered down to the bottom of the hole at 44.78 mbsf.  

The poor recovery for Hole M0103 makes it difficult to detect downhole trends in the physica l properties data. However, there is a notable peak in the magnetic susceptibility data at the lithologic boundary at 26.60 mbsf, and there is variability in the $L^{*}$ data that may correspond to change s in lithology (e.g., rhodolith rudstone/floatstone to algal boundstone).

Four U-Th dates were obtained from Hole M0103A that span ${\sim}138{-}216\ \mathrm{ky}$ BP. The dates are i n stratigraphic order and are consistent with the interpretation of the age of the H2 terrace spannin g MISs 6 and 7 (Ludwig et al., 1991; Webster et al., 2009).  

# 7.2.2.2. Site M0104  

Site M0104 consists of one hole located at a water depth of $347\,\mathrm{~m~}$ (Figures F13, F19). Hol e M0104A spans 0–46.15 mbsf, and based on the main lithologic changes, discontinuity surfaces, and/or changes in physical properties, it is possible to identify five main lithostratigraphic intervals. Interval 1 is formed by the upper consolidated biodetrital grainstone to rudstone, from 0 t o $0.80\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , and is bounded at its base by a major facies change and by a change in physical properties. Interval 2 forms the largest part of the hole and consists predominantly of coralgal microbia l boundstone from 0.80 mbsf to 31.81 mbsf with occurrences of thin sections of microbial-alga l boundstone and algal boundstone. The base of this interval is a blackened, hardened, and bore d surface with a sharp change in physical properties. Interval 3 is composed of consolidated biodetrital grainstone and algal boundstone (with occasional coralgal grainstone) from 31.81 to 39.8 7 mbsf, and it is bounded at its base by a major facies change, as well as a change in physical properties. The base of this interval is a heavily bored surface. Interval 4 comprises coralgal boundstone, algal boundstone, and biodetrital grainstone facies from 39.87 to 43.39 mbsf. The top is capped b y rhodoliths, and the base is marked by a coralgal boundstone. The base is defined by major change s in both facies and physical properties. Interval 5 consists of biodetrital grainstone and alga l boundstone from 43.39 to 46.15 mbsf.  

The boundaries between lithologic intervals have marked changes in physical properties:  a decrease in magnetic susceptibility and an increase in $L^{*}$ values at the base of Interval 1, a tren d from dominantly high $L^{\ast}$ values to more variable $L^{*}$ values within Interval 2 and a striking increas e in magnetic susceptibility values from about 20 mbsf to the highest values at the base of Interval 2, relatively low magnetic susceptibility values in Interval 3, relatively low magnetic susceptibilit y and relatively high and less variable $L^{\ast}$ values in Interval 4, and a slight increase in magnetic susceptibility values in Interval 5.  

A total of three U-Th dates were obtained from corals from Hole M0104A and span ${\sim}130{-}159\,\mathrm{ky}$ BP with no stratigraphic age reversals. These dates are consistent with the estimated age of the H 2 terrace spanning MIS 6/7 (Ludwig et al., 1991; Webster et al., 2009).  

# 7.2.2.3. Site M0105  

Site M0105 consists of one hole located at a water depth of $340\,\mathrm{m}$ (Figures F13, F19). Based on th e main lithologic changes, Hole M0105A can be divided into four main lithostratigraphic intervals. The top interval is rhodoliths in a dark gray unconsolidated biodetrital and volcaniclastic sand y matrix, and the second interval is dominated by algal boundstone around 7.5 mbsf. Because o f poor recovery, the vertical extent and the boundaries of this interval are unknown.  The thir d interval, only recovered from 7.69 to $12.95~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , is dominated by a fragmented coralgal boundstone (predominantly columnar and robust branching Porites) embedded in unconsolidate d biodetrital background sediments. The fourth interval represents lava flows and basalt clinker, which is usually produced on the top and leading edge of ‘a’a lava flows, much of which is fresh an d unaltered, although zones of fracturing and alteration occur locally.  

In the upper three lithologic intervals of reef material, poor recovery makes it difficult to detec t downhole trends in the physical properties data. However, there are notable changes in the MSC L and $L^{*}$ data that reflect the transition from reef material above to basalt below. Relative to the ree f lithologies, the basalt has lower $L^{\ast}$ and higher density and magnetic susceptibility, notable variability that may correspond to changes in the physical properties and/or chemistry of the basalts.  

There are two U-Th dates for Hole M0105A, both ${\sim}132~\mathrm{ky}$ BP, consistent with the previouslyinferred timing of formation of the H2 terrace spanning MIS 6/7 (Webster et al., 2009; Puga-Bernabéu et al., 2016).  

# 7.2.3. Ka Lae site  

Because of the denial of permit applications to sample the H1d reef in Hawaiian state waters at an y of the planned locations on the leeward (Kawaihae and Kona) and windward (Hilo) sides, a reques t was made and permission received from the IODP Site Survey Panel and EPSP to add a site on th e H1d reef in the Ka Lae region (South Point). This was the only location available to drill on th e H1d reef on the windward side of Hawai’i that was located in federal waters (Figure F14). The sit e survey data at Ka Lae is limited. To select the drilling location of Site M0106, we used the availabl e bathymetric data and the information from two HURL submersible dives (P5-77 and P5-78), including images, pilot logs, and descriptions and locations of collected carbonate rocks (see Webster et al., 2004 for references).  

# 7.2.3.1. Site M0106  

Two holes were drilled to ${\sim}16$ mbsf at Site M0106 (Holes M0102A and M0102B) at water depth s of ${\sim}148\mathrm{~m~}$ (Figures F14, F20). Core material recovered from Site M0106 consists mostly of loos e rhodoliths with crustose and fruticose coralline algal crusts down to 11.50 mbsf. Below this dept h in Hole M0106B, a $1.30~\mathrm{m}$ section of unconsolidated biodetrital sediment contains pebble-size d rhodoliths and coral clasts in a finer bioclastic matrix that overlies a coralgal boundstone wit h massive Porites.  

The poor recovery at Site M0106 makes it difficult to detect downhole trends in the physical properties data. However, there is a notable increase in the $L^{\ast}$ data that may correspond to changes i n lithology at 11.50 mbsf from rhodoliths to coralgal boundstone.  

Two radiocarbon dates were obtained from Site M0106, and they span $27{-}35\,^{14}\!C$ ky BP. The date s are consistent with the interpretation of the age of the H1 terrace spanning MISs 1–5 (Webster e t al., 2009; Ludwig et al., 1991).

# 8. Geochemistry  

Sixteen surface seawater samples were collected during the offshore phase of Expedition 389, on e at each of the 15 drill sites and an additional sample at the location of Site M0099, using an improvised sampling device or a 2L Niskin bottle. Parameters including salinity, pH, alkalinity, an d ammonium concentrations were analyzed offshore, and major cations and anions were measure d during the OSP. Results for all parameters fall within the expected ranges for surface seawater.  

A total of 36 interstitial water samples were collected from all intervals with sufficient undisturbe d soft sediment using Rhizon samplers during the offshore phase of Expedition 389. Two sample s are from Site M0099, 14 are from Site M0101, 14 are from Site M0102, 3 are from Site M0103, an d 2 are from Site M0105. Parameters including salinity, pH, alkalinity, and ammonium concentrations were analyzed offshore, and major cations and anions were measured during the OSP. Downhole trends are only apparent at Sites M0101 and M0102, where most of the measurement s were made. At Site M0101, there are notable downhole trends in sulfate, strontium, manganese, chloride, and barium. At Site M0102, there are downhole trends in pH and ammonium, calcium, strontium, and silicate. Future work may identify the processes responsible for these downhol e trends.  

Rock and sediment samples from all sites were taken during the OSP for IODP standard measurements. In total, 144 samples were analyzed for bulk composition using energy dispersive X-Ra y fluorescence (ED-XRF). In addition, splits of those samples were analyzed for total carbon (TC ) and total organic carbon (TOC) using a carbon-sulfur analyzer, and total inorganic carbon (TIC ) was calculated as the difference between TC and TOC. The set of 144 samples comprises 3 fro m Site M0096, 31 from Site M0097, 3 from Site M0098, 22 from Site M0099, 1 from Site M0100, 1 0 from Site M0101, 14 from Site M0102, 6 from Site M0103, 9 from Site M0104, 2 from Site M0105, 2 from Site M0106, 2 from Site M0107, 4 from Site M0108 and 5 from Site M0110. Because of th e short length of the core, no bulk samples for geochemistry were taken from Site M0109.  

The bulk composition results primarily reflect large differences between samples from fossil ree f compared to samples from basalt intervals. As such, the sites at which basalt was recovere d (M0096, M0099, M0100, M0101, M0105, M0107, and M0110) have a large range of bulk compositions exemplified by the contrast between relatively high concentrations of calcium in the fossi l reef facies samples compared to the relatively low concentrations of calcium and high concentrations of aluminum, iron, manganese, and silica in the basalt samples. The bulk geochemical dat a can be used to divide the reef facies samples into two groups characterized by their location on th e leeward versus windward sides of Hawai’i. Aluminum, iron, manganese, and silica concentration s are below detection limit in reef facies samples from all the leeward/dry sites and some of th e windward sites, but these elements have modest to moderate concentrations, relative to pur e basalt samples, in reef facies samples from several of the windward/wet sites (M0101, M0102, an d M0104).  

As expected, the TC and TOC weight percent values primarily reflect large differences betwee n samples from reef facies compared to samples from basalt intervals. There is some variabilit y within the data from reef facies samples, with typical values ranging $11–12\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ TC, and 0.1–0. 2 wt% TOC.  

# 9. Paleomagnetism  

Approximately one plug sample per core section, and in a few cases sediment cubes, were obtaine d from all sites except for Sites M0108 and M0109 during the OSP, for a total of 308 samples (30 1 plugs and 7 cubes). The lack of cohesive material due to drilling disturbance prevented paleomagnetic sampling for Sites M0108 and M0109. Measurements of low-field and mass-specific magnetic susceptibility $(\upchi)$ were carried out for all samples. Natural remanent magnetization (NRM ) was measured for all plug samples, as well as remanence following stepwise alternating field (AF ) demagnetization up to a peak AF of $20~\mathrm{mT}$ and for basalt samples up to $100\;\mathrm{mT}$ . The samples ar e from two main lithologies: reef carbonates and basalts. A total of 193 samples are carbonate, an d the remaining 105 are basalt.  

Across all the Expedition 389 sites, $\Upsilon$ values range $-2.73\,\times\,10^{-8}$ to $1.31\,\times\,10^{-4}\,\,\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{kg}$ and initia l NRM intensity values range $4.50\times10^{-7}$ to $5.89\times10^{-1}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ . This range generally reflects the differences in lithology, with basalts having higher $\Upsilon$ values and higher NRM intensity values compare d to carbonates. These differences are clearly seen in data from Sites M0096, M0097, M0099, M0101, M0102, M0105, and M110, where both carbonate and basalt samples were analyzed. T o get an idea of end-member values, sites where only basalt samples were analyzed can be compare d to sites where only carbonate samples were measured; sites with only basalt samples (Sites M010 0 and M0107) have an arithmetic mean $\Upsilon$ value of $7.07\times10^{-6}\;\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{kg}$ and an arithmetic mean initia l NRM value of $6.07\,\times\,10^{-2}\,\,\mathrm{A/m},$ , compared to sites with only carbonate samples (Sites M0098, M0103, M0104, and M0106), which have an arithmetic mean $\Upsilon$ value of $1.86\times10^{-7}\;\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{kg}$ and a n arithmetic mean initial NRM value of $1.93\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ .  

Visual inspection of the data indicates that χ values covary with initial NRM values at most sites i n both carbonate and basaltic intervals, suggesting that magnetic mineral concentrations may driv e downhole variations in both parameters. However, there are exceptions in some carbonate intervals where no covariance is apparent, probably as an artifact of very low mineral concentrations. I n addition, data from Hole M0110B show that $\Upsilon$ does not co-vary with initial NRM, possibly reflecting changes in magnetic grain size.  

There are site-to-site differences in χ values measured within carbonate samples that may reflec t differences in the contribution and incorporation of volcanic sediment into the reef facies. This i s apparent when comparing measurements of carbonate samples from the windward/wet Site s M0101, M0102, and M0103 to the leeward/dry Sites M0097, M0098, M0099, and M0110: the carbonate samples from the windward/wet site have maximum $\Upsilon$ values up to $9.92\,\times\,10^{-6}\,\,\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{kg},$ approximately three orders of magnitude higher than the maximum $\Upsilon$ values from carbonate samples from the leeward/dry sites.  

# 10. Preliminary scientific assessment  

# 10.1. Objective 1: to define the nature of sea level change in the central Pacific over the last 500 ky  

We aim to reconstruct the most complete and detailed sea level record from fossil corals, particularly into, during, and out of the glacial periods. These data will allow more detailed testing of th e sensitivity and vulnerability of ice sheet responses to orbital to millennial-scale climate change.  A sea level curve will be built using absolute radiometric dating methods ( $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ accelerator mass spectrometry [AMS] $<50\mathrm{~ka}$ and U/Th) of in situ corals, paleobathymetric data, and published an d directly calculated subsidence rates for Hawai’i.  

The offshore phase successfully recovered cores from the succession of fossil reef terraces (H1, H2, H4, H6, H7, H8, and H12) between 130 and 1240 mbsl. Initial observations of the $340\;\mathrm{m}$ of fossi l reef cores and reconnaissance radiometric dating reveal that the archives span the past $500{,}000\;\mathrm{y}.$ The preliminary data also suggest we recovered sequences indicative of reef growth and demis e during numerous periods of major ice sheet and sea level instability (e.g., MIS 12-11, MIS 10-9, MIS 7-5, MIS 3, and MIS 2-1). During the OSP, high-quality fossil coralgal samples, consisten t with shallow, high-energy settings, were taken for dating and sea level change investigations, th e results of which are expected to contribute to Objective 1.  

# 10.2. Objective 2: to reconstruct paleoclimate variability for the last 500 ky and establish the relationship between the mean climate state and seasonal–interannual variability  

We aim to use coral-derived temperature and precipitation records to investigate how high-latitude climate (e.g., ice sheet size), atmospheric $C O_{2}$ levels, and mean and seasonal solar radiatio n impact Hawaiian climate including storminess and the position of the Intertropical Convergenc e Zone. In combination with theoretical studies of subtropical climate change, these records wil l allow for the identification and study of critical processes that determine Pacific-wide climate.  

The offshore phase successfully recovered massive, submassive, and columnar Porites spp. cora l colonies that are potentially suitable for paleoclimate studies. Most of the specimens that can b e used for monthly-resolution, multidecadal paleoclimate reconstructions are from the H1 and H 2 terraces; preliminary dates indicate these samples are probably from MISs 3, 6, and 7. There is als o a high abundance of smaller specimens that represent ${<}15\mathrm{~y~}$ of growth found throughout th e recovered reef sections. At the OSP, $>\!200$ samples were taken for paleoclimate analyses. Overall, preliminary assessment of the quality and possible ages of the suite of corals specimens recovere d during Expedition 389 suggest they grew during past periods with a wide dynamic range of climat e forcing boundary conditions and thus will contribute to Objective 2.  

# 10.3. Objective 3: to establish the geologic and biological response of coral reef systems to abrupt sea level and climate changes  

We aim to reconstruct the detailed stratigraphic, geomorphic, and paleoenvironmental evolutio n of each reef in response to abrupt sea level and climate changes; test ecological theories abou t coral reef resilience and vulnerability to past and future climate changes by assessing the natur e and rate of change in reef communities within and between successive reefs over interglacial–millennial timescales; and establish the nature of living and ancient microbial communities in th e reefs and their role in reef building.  

The offshore phase successfully recovered fossil reef cores from reef terraces at a range of wate r depths and ages from five different geographic areas around the island, representing both the leeward/dry and windward/wet sides of Hawai’i. Therefore, analyses of samples taken during the OS P will be interpreted in a broad spatial-temporal context, which will allow a rich understanding o f the development of the Hawaiian reef system in response to major environmental changes ove r the past $500\ \mathrm{ky}.$ . Preliminary observations of the cores confirm a diverse suite of lithologies an d facies (mixtures of coralgal material, microbialite, and sediments) representing various shallow t o deep depositional reefs settings, as well the numerous, major lithologic boundaries indicatin g repeated reef initiation and demise that when investigated further will contribute to Objective 3.  

# 10.4. Objective 4: to elucidate the subsidence and volcanic history of Hawai’i  

We aim to refine the variation through space and time of the subsidence of Hawai’i and contribut e to understanding the volcanic evolution of the island. The key to this objective is to obtain welldated volcanic samples from the base of each hole and interbedded within or draping over th e reefs.  

During the offshore phase, volcanic eruption products were recovered from numerous sites an d from nearly all geographic areas studied (all but Ka Lae). These volcanic products, primarily lav a flows, were found on top of, within (interbedded), and beneath the reef terraces sampled durin g the expedition. These materials are sufficient to deduce eruption conditions (subaerial, littoral, and submarine) and deposit distance from volcanic vents. Given the preliminary ages of associate d reef material, these lava flows likely date to a time period that is not well represented on the islan d of Hawai’i and will therefore be critical for reconstructing the Late Pleistocene geological histor y of Hawai’i.  

# 11. Outreach  

The overall aim of the ESO Outreach and Education effort is to promote the science of each expedition and the wider objectives of IODP and ECORD to a broad audience, including the scientifi c community and general public. To accomplish this objective, the outreach goals were to publiciz e  

the aims of the expedition and initial results to media outlets, IODP offices, communicatio n departments of science party members, and social media.  

# 11.1. Targeted activities  

The expedition web page on the ECORD website was used as a source of information by includin g daily and weekly offshore reports and links to the blog. The website also includes links to expedition materials and a media pack with information about media releases along with pictures an d contact details to arrange interviews with the expedition scientists.  

In total, 28 articles were posted on Expedition 389’s blog (3 pre-offshore, 18 offshore, and  7 onshore). The blog was visited nearly 13,000 times between June 2023 and March 2024. Visitor s came mostly from Germany, the U.S.A., Australia, the United Kingdom, India, Japan, France, Netherlands, Italy, and Spain.  

All Science Party members were encouraged to contact and inform the communications departments of their home institutions before the offshore and the onshore phases of the expedition. Th e aim was to raise awareness of their staff’s participation in the expedition locally and nationally.  

Expedition promotional materials, including an expedition logo and flier, as well as branded item s such as caps, T-shirts, iron-on patches, and stickers, were available during the offshore phase. Banners with the IODP and ECORD logos and the expedition logo were displayed on board th e MMA Valour during the offshore phase. Widespread use of logos was documented in photograph s and videos.  

Two embargoed press releases were issued, one before the offshore phase and one toward the en d of the OSP. Both were shared with all science party members’ communication department s including the Australia-New Zealand IODP Consortium (ANZIC), the U.S. Science Support Program (USSSP), and all ECORD entities. The press releases were also distributed via EurekAler t and idw (Informationsdienst Wissenschaft/Germany). Two media days were held, and invitation s were issued to local and regional media both on Hawai’i just before embarking the vessel and i n Bremen toward the end of the onshore phase. One interested person but no media participant s attended prior to the offshore phase. The media day during the OSP was attended by the larges t newspaper in the region as well as a local television station. A wider audience was reached wit h more personalized news items on Science Party members institution’s homepages and personalized media releases as well as individual social media engagement by the science party.  

An Onboard Outreach Officer (OOO) (Marley Parker) was chosen by the ECORD outreach tas k force (EOTF) in July 2023. During the first leg of the offshore phase, the OOO participated of f shore and took pictures, wrote feature stories for the blog, and posted short insights about th e expedition to ECORD social media channels. These activities continued during the second leg o f the expedition and after the offshore phase. A short film was produced onboard the MMA Valour and shared on YouTube to give insights about living aboard a research vessel and the scientifi c objectives of the expedition. The OOO attended the first half of the OSP in Bremen and, assiste d by EOTF members, wrote features for the expedition blog, documented the tasks of the scienc e party in pictures, and undertook filming for a short film about the expedition featuring six scienc e party members, highlighting the international nature of the program and including representatio n of all IODP expedition operators.  

# 11.2. Community engagement  

Prior to the expedition, there was insufficient community engagement with the native and loca l Hawaiian community, which was the primary reason for being denied permits to operate i n Hawai’i state waters, thereby compromising some important expedition objectives. The lack o f trust building with the Hawaiian community also caused internal feelings of dissonance in man y scientists who are committed both to social justice and to the expedition’s scientific objectives. During the active offshore operational phase, a 10 minute Q&A video was produced and publishe d on the expedition website addressing questions about the expedition science and the active offshore phase of the expedition. Interview requests during the offshore phase were met by the Co  

Chief Scientists and included an interview for regional television news. During the offshore phase, local community members and interested parties were invited to join an online meeting on  5 October 2023; however, there were no attendees. Following the conclusion of the offshore phase, and in response to not gaining the permits required to operate in Hawaiian state waters, ESO published a statement on the expedition website (see below) regarding community engagement o n Hawai’i.
