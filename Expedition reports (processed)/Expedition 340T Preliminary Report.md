# Abstract  

During Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 340T we conducted borehole logging in IODP Hole U1309D on the domal core of Atlantis Massif just west of the spreading axis of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, $30^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ . Prior seismic imaging showed considerable reflectivity within the footwall of this oceanic core complex, and our new results document the geologic explanation for at least some of the impedance contrast. The dominantly gabbroic section, cored to 1415 meters below seafloor (mbsf) during IODP Expeditions 304 and 305, would not inherently contain density/ seismic contrasts sufficient to reflect seismic energy. Expedition 340T aimed to test the hypothesis that highly altered intervals and/or fluid-bearing fault zones at depth might be responsible for these contrasts, thus allowing interpretation of the reflectivity patterns in terms of hydration pathways within young oceanic crust. Our results confirm that borehole velocity of altered olivine-rich troctolite intervals at Site U1309 is sufficiently distinct from surrounding rock $(V_{\mathsf{P}}\,{\sim}\,0.5~\mathrm{km/s}$ slower) to produce a multichannel seismic reflection given their several tens of meters thickness. Small dips in temperature $(0.3^{\circ}{-}0.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ were measured in borehole fluid adjacent to known faults at 750 and 1100 mbsf. These suggest that percolation of seawater along the fault zone is still active, not just a past process that produced the alteration documented in Expedition 305 core from these intervals. In addition to obtaining the first seismic coverage of the 800–1400 mbsf portion of Hole U1309D and reliable downhole temperatures, we acquired other standard logging data that are in excellent agreement with Expedition 304/305 borehole measurements. Vertical seismic profile station coverage at zero offset now extends the full length of the hole, including the uppermost 150 mbsf, where detachment processes are expected to have left their strongest imprint. Opportunistic sampling of a seafloor feature, now designated IODP Site U1392 and located a few meters from Hole U1309D, recovered fragments of possible cap rock that may provide information on processes within the exposed detachment.  

# Introduction  

During Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 340T we conducted borehole logging at Atlantis Massif, an oceanic core complex (OCC) just west of the spreading axis of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, $30^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ . Seismic data for the $800–1400\;\mathrm{m}$ interval cored in Hole U1309D during IODP Expeditions 304 and 305 are the primary new information, whereas a number of ancillary measurements at the site also aim to address the question of where seawater penetrates and alters young oceanic lithosphere, thus hydrating a key chemical reservoir in the Earth. The detachment fault that controlled formation of Atlantis Massif (Cann et al., 1997; Blackman et al., 2002; Schroeder and John, 2004; Karson et al., 2006) is known to have localized fluid flow in a ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ thick zone of deformation/alteration that is exposed at the seafloor (Boschi et al., 2006; McCaig et al., 2010). Additional zones of (at least) past seawater circulation are indicated in deeper known or inferred fault zones or portions of olivinerich troctolite intervals that are altered to serpentinite (Hirose and Hayman, 2008; Michibayashi et al., 2008; Beard et al., 2009). Seismic reflectivity observed in multichannel seismic (MCS) data throughout the Central Dome and Southern Ridge of the massif (Canales et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2004; Blackman et al., 2009) may correspond to interfaces between zones of past and/or present fluid flow and the surrounding rock. The main goal of Expedition 340T was to begin to test this hypothesis.  

# Background  

Slow-spread ocean lithosphere accretes and evolves via temporally and spatially variable magmatic and tectonic processes (e.g., Bonatti and Honnorez, 1976; OTTER, 1984; Dick, 1989; Lin et al., 1990; Sinton and Detrick, 1992; Cannat, 1993; Lagabrielle et al., 1998). OCCs, in particular, mark significant periods $\left(1{-}2\;\mathrm{m.y.}\right)$ ) when a distinct mode of rifting/accretion persists, in contrast to the more typical interplay between magma supply and faulting that generates the ubiquitous abyssal hills. Long-lived displacement along detachment faults active within the ${\sim}20\ \mathrm{km}$ wide axial zone of a slow-spreading center exhumes the characteristic domal cores of an OCC, which are often capped by spreading-parallel corrugations (e.g., Cann et al., 1997; Tucholke et al., 1998). Beneath this exposed fault zone, gabbroic rocks with lenses, or possibly greater volumes of mantle peridotite, are present, providing access to a major component of Earth’s deep lithosphere for detailed chemical and physical property investigations.  Conditions  of  OCC  development  are  documented  by  igneous  and metamorphic assemblages, as well as by deformation recorded during evolution of the footwall.  

# Geological setting  

Atlantis Massif is a young OCC where regional geophysical surveys and seafloor mapping and sampling coverage are good; major structural blocks within the faulted lithosphere have been identified (Fig. F1). The domal core of Atlantis Massif was unroofed via detachment faulting that occurred within the rift zone of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at ${\sim}1.1–0.5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Blackman et al., 2011; Grimes et al., 2008). Atlantis Massif was initially hypothesized to be an OCC on the basis of morphologic and backscatter mapping and dredging results that documented the shallow, corrugated, and striated domal core underlain by mafic and ultramafic rocks (Cann et al., 1997). The spreading-parallel corrugations are equated with similar-scale features mapped on continental detachment faults (John, 1987) and suggest that the surface was a slip plane associated with the detachment fault that unroofed the dome. Schroeder and John (2004) and Karson et al. (2006) confirmed the existence of a long-lived normal fault at the top of the Southern Ridge by documenting deformation within a zone extending at least a few kilometers in length. The juxtaposition of volcanic eastern blocks against the corrugated dome, whose Southern Ridge samples include gabbroic rocks $(\sim\!30\%)$ and serpentinized peridotite $(\sim\!70\%)$ , supports the OCC model. Gravity and seismic data indicate that significant portions of the footwall to the detachment contain rocks with anomalously high density $(200{-}400\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{3}$ greater than surrounding rock) (Blackman et al., 2008) and velocity $(4{-}6\;\mathrm{km}/{\mathrm{s}}$ in the upper kilometer, compared to average Atlantic upper crust at ${\sim}3\mathrm{-}5~\mathrm{km/s})$ ) (Canales et al., 2008; Collins et al., 2009). The active serpentinite-hosted Lost City hydrothermal vent field (Kelley et al., 2001; Früh-Green et al., 2003) is located just below the peak of the massif at the apex of the Southern Ridge. The Central Dome, extending smoothly to the north, is several hundred meters deeper; it is against only this part of the footwall that the juxtaposed volcanic hanging wall exists. It is assumed to overlie the detachment where it extends at depth.  

Differences between the Central Dome and the domal Southern Ridge (Karson et al., 2006; Boschi et al., 2006; Blackman, Ildefonse, John, Ohara, Miller, MacLeod, and the Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006; Blackman et al., 2011; Ildefonse et al., 2007; Canales et al., 2008) raise questions about how axial magmatism, the detachment system, and subseafloor alteration may have progressed in space and time as this core complex formed. If we can determine the geologic origin of reflectivity within the uplifted footwall to the detachment, future seismic imaging could provide definitive tests of models for along- and across-strike variation in the structure and development of oceanic core complexes. The availability of the $1415\;\mathrm{m}$ deep borehole at IODP Site U1309 provides a unique opportunity to groundtruth properties measured at seismic wavelengths.  

# Seismic studies/Site survey data  

MCS data (Canales et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2004) show significant reflectivity throughout the Central Dome and Southern Ridge (Fig. F2), but the cause of this reflectivity is difficult to explain based on what is known about the dominantly gabbroic primary lithology at Site U1309. Results from Hole U1309D indicate that alteration varies quite rapidly downhole and there are a number of sharp changes in borehole resistivity, two of which coincide with the boundaries of several tens-of-meters thick, highly altered olivine-rich troctolite units (Fig. F3). The strong D-reflection, noted by Canales et al. (2004) to be pervasive throughout the dome and apparently an isolated event at 0.2–0.5 s two-way traveltime using initial processing, has been shown via a wide-angle reflection processing method (Masoomzadeh et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2007) to most likely be the first in a series of reflections (Fig. F2) (Singh et al., 2004). This reflective zone may be associated with altered olivine-rich troctolite units (Fig. F2C). However, this interpretation needs to be investigated more carefully using a better in situ velocity model and the best-possible ties to the core/borehole data.  

Modeling of near-bottom explosive source (NOBEL) (Collins et al., 2009) and MCS streamer refraction traveltimes (Canales et al., 2008; Henig et al., 2010, in press) indicates that at least parts of the dome are capped by a $100{-}200\ \mathrm{m}$ thick low-velocity layer $(<\!4\;\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s})$ (Fig. F2D). Reliable first arrival times for vertical seismic profile (VSP) stations in the $50{-}200\mathrm{~m~}$ depth interval can provide groundtruth on this crucial interval, where imprints of detachment zone processes may extend beyond the very narrow, high-deformation interval documented by talc-schist fault rock sampled only in the upper several meters at Site U1309 (Blackman, Ildefonse, John, Ohara, Miller, MacLeod, and the Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006; Blackman et al., 2011; McCaig et al., 2010). Sonic logging in the 800–1415 meters below seafloor (mbsf) interval can provide velocity constraints on the 1080–1200 mbsf altered olivine-rich troctolite interval (Fig. F3A). The $V_{\mathsf{P}}/V_{\mathsf{S}}$ ratio of the $\sim\!350$ mbsf olivine-rich units appears to be higher $(\sim\!2.0)$ than average $(\mathord{\sim}1.8)$ , and the Expedition 340T data can show whether this is characteristic of these units.  

# Scientific objectives  

Two observations made during Expedition 340T inform young ocean lithosphere studies, in general. Each required minimum possible disturbance approaching and reentering the hole:  

1. Visual observation of whether the well was “producing” (flow out of the hole) or not: addresses fluid flow within the crust and chemical exchange with seawater in maturing lithosphere.   
2. Measurement of borehole fluid temperature: assesses conditions that may be encountered by future ultradeep drilling/logging of an intrusive oceanic section; also tests for possible fluid flow (temperature deviations) within fault zones of Atlantis Massif’s footwall.  

Focusing on our main objectives, obtaining new caliper measurements throughout the hole documents hole condition and guided selection of VSP station depths that might be optimum for instrument coupling. The zero-offset VSP data provide information on velocities in the vicinity of the hole at intermediate length scales and could increase our knowledge of local reflectivity for near-vertical waves, thereby improving core-log integration with surface seismic data. Information on the condition of the borehole is crucial for determining whether a future single-ship wireline reentry experiment is viable or whether the drillship and a second vessel would be needed to complete the VSP experiment by conducting a walk-away component. Ultimately, this full data set would enable core-log-survey integration at as high a level as possible with current geophysical data.  

Sonic logs obtained during Expedition 340T will allow analysis of the relationship between lithology and velocity in the section deeper than 800 mbsf, where the least altered rock was recovered from Hole U1309D. In addition to compressional velocity $(V_{\mathsf{P}})$ and shear velocity $\left(V_{\mathsf{S}}\right)$ correlations with either primary or alteration lithologies, complete hole Stoneley wave data will enable assessment of permeability/fracturing and any contrast thereof between documented fault zones and surrounding rock.  

Magnetic susceptibility logs target downhole variations in magnetite that are a product of serpentinization, potentially providing constraints on extent/style of alteration that may have been missed with the finite (although very good) core recovery (nonwhite portion of Fig. F3A).  

# Downhole logging  

Downhole logs are measurements of physical, chemical, and structural properties of the formation surrounding a borehole. The data are continuous with depth (at vertical sampling intervals ranging from $2.5~\mathrm{mm}$ to $15\;\mathrm{cm}$ ) and are measured in situ. The sampling is intermediate in scale between laboratory measurements on core samples and geophysical surveys and provides a necessary link for the integrated understanding of physical properties on all scales.  

Logs in “hard rock” such as at Site U1309 can be interpreted in terms of the lithology, mineralogy, and geochemical composition of the penetrated formation. They also provide information on the status and size of the borehole and on possible deformations induced by drilling or formation stress. When core recovery is incomplete or disturbed, log data may provide the only way to characterize the formation. These data can be used to determine the actual thickness of individual units or lithologies when contacts are not recovered, to pinpoint the true depth of features in cores with incomplete recovery, and to identify intervals that were not recovered.  

Logs are recorded with a variety of tools combined into several tool strings, which are run downhole. For deep holes, logging runs may be made to intermediate depths between coring phases to obtain wall rock measurements before multiple bit runs risk the possibility of hole degradation. Four tool strings were used during Expedition 340T in Hole U1309D, which had previously been cored and partially logged to 1415 mbsf (see Fig. F4; Table T1):  

1. A modified triple combination (triple combo) tool string (gamma ray, density, resistivity, and borehole temperature),   
2. A sonic string (gamma ray and sonic velocity),   
3. The Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI) tool string (vertical seismic profile and gamma ray), and   
4. The Magnetic Susceptibility Sonde (MSS) tool string (gamma ray, magnetic susceptibility, and temperature).  

After reentering Hole U1309D, the logging bit at the end of the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) was set below the casing shoe located at ${\sim}20~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , below an interval where prior experience suggested potential obstacles. Bit depth varied throughout the operations based on hole conditions. See Table T2 for details of logging operations.  

Each tool string deployment is a logging “run,” starting with the assembly of the tool string and the necessary calibrations. The tool string is then sent down to the bottom of the hole while recording a partial set of data, and, except for the VSI, is pulled up at a constant speed, typically $300{-}500\ \mathrm{m/h},$ , to record the main data. The VSI is clamped against the borehole wall at regularly spaced depths while shooting the seismic source and pulled up between each station. During each run, tool strings can be lowered down and pulled up the hole several times for control of repeatability or to try to improve the quality of the data. Each lowering or hauling up of the tool string while collecting data constitutes a “pass.” During each pass the incoming data are recorded and monitored in real time on the surface system. A logging run is complete once the tool string has been brought to the rig floor and disassembled.  

# Logged properties and tool measurement principles  

The main logs recorded during Expedition 340T are listed in Table T3. More detailed information on individual tools and their geological applications may be found in Ellis and Singer (2007), Goldberg (1997), Lovell et al. (1998), Rider (1996), Schlumberger (1989), and Serra (1984, 1986, 1989). A complete online list of acronyms for the Schlumberger tools and measurement curves is available at www.slb.com/modules/mnemonics/index.aspx.  

# Borehole temperature  

The triple combo tool string deployed during Expedition 340T included the Modular Temperature Tool (MTT) to measure the borehole fluid temperature. The MTT was designed at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) to resolve centimeter-scale temperature variations at typical logging speeds of $300{-}500\;\mathrm{m/h}$ . It uses two temperature sensors: a fast responding thermocouple and a highly accurate resistance-temperature device. The sonde also contains an accelerometer for depth correction and is combined with a specially designed cartridge to allow data transmission through the Schlumberger tool string and wireline.  

Additional temperature measurements were made during each logging run by a sensor in the logging equipment head–mud temperature (LEH-MT) cablehead and processed by the Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC) (see “Telemetry cartridges”).  

# Natural radioactivity  

The EDTC (see “Telemetry cartridges”), which is used primarily to communicate data to the surface, also includes a sodium iodide scintillation detector to measure the total natural gamma ray emission. It is not a spectral tool but it provides high-resolution total gamma ray for each pass that allows for precise depth-match processing between logging runs and passes.  

# Density  

Formation density was measured with the Hostile Environment Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS). The sonde contains a radioactive cesium $(^{137}\mathrm{Cs})$ gamma ray source $(622\;\mathrm{keV})$ and far and near gamma ray detectors mounted on a shielded skid, which is pressed against the borehole wall by an eccentralizing arm. Gamma rays emitted by the source undergo Compton scattering, whereby gamma rays are scattered by electrons in the formation. The number of scattered gamma rays that reach the detectors is proportional to the density of electrons in the formation, which is in turn related to bulk density. Porosity may also be derived from this bulk density if the matrix (grain) density is known. Good contact between the tool and borehole wall is essential for good HLDS logs; poor contact results in underestimation of density values.  

The HLDS also measures photoelectric absorption as the photoelectric effect (PEF). Photoelectric absorption of the gamma rays occurs when their energy is reduced below $150\;\mathrm{keV}$ after being repeatedly scattered by electrons in the formation. Because PEF depends on the atomic number of the elements encountered, it varies with the chemical composition of the minerals present and can be used for the identification of some minerals (Bartetzko et al., 2003; Blackman, Ildefonse, John, Ohara, Miller, MacLeod, and the Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006).  

# Electrical resistivity  

The High-Resolution Laterolog Array (HRLA) tool provides six resistivity measurements with different depths of investigation (including the borehole fluid, or mud, resistivity and five measurements of formation resistivity with increasing penetration into the formation). The sonde sends a focused current beam into the formation and measures the intensity necessary to maintain a constant drop in voltage across a fixed interval, providing direct resistivity measurement. The array has one central (source) electrode and six electrodes above and below it, which serve alternately as focusing and returning current electrodes. By rapidly changing the role of these electrodes, a simultaneous resistivity measurement at six penetration depths is achieved. The tool is designed to ensure that all signals are measured at exactly the same time and same tool position, and to reduce the sensitivity to shoulder bed effects. The design, which eliminates the need for a surface reference electrode, improves formation resistivity evaluation compared to the traditional dual laterolog sonde that was used in previous expeditions to Hole U1309D.  

Typically, igneous minerals found in crustal rocks are electrical insulators, whereas sulfide and oxide minerals as well as ionic solutions like pore water are conductors. In most rocks, electrical conduction occurs primarily by ion transport through pore fluids and, thus, is strongly dependent on porosity. Electrical resistivity can hence be used to estimate porosity, alteration, and fluid salinity.  

# Acoustic velocity  

The Dipole Sonic Imager (DSI) generates acoustic pulses from various sonic transmitters and records the full waveforms with an array of eight receivers. The waveforms are then used to calculate the sonic velocity in the formation. The omnidirectional monopole transmitter emits high-frequency $(5{-}15\,\mathrm{kHz})$ ) pulses to extract the compressional velocity $(V_{\mathsf{P}})$ of the formation, as well as the shear velocity $\left(V_{\mathsf{S}}\right)$ when it is faster than the sound velocity in the borehole fluid. The same transmitter can be fired in sequence at a lower frequency $(0.5{-}1~\mathrm{kHz})$ to generate Stoneley waves that are sensitive to fractures and variations in permeability. The DSI also has two dipole transmitters, which allow an additional measurement of shear wave velocity in “slow” formations, where $V_{\mathsf{S}}$ is slower than the velocity in the borehole fluid. However, in formations such as the basement penetrated in Hole U1309D, $V_{\mathsf{S}}$ was primarily measured from the monopole waveforms. These higher frequency waveforms usually provide a sharper shear arrival and more accurate estimate of $V_{\mathsf{S}}$ than either of the dipole sources. The two shear velocities measured from the two orthogonal dipole transducers can be used to identify sonic anisotropy that can be associated with the local stress regime.  

During acquisition, ${\cal{V}}_{\mathsf{P}}$ and $V_{\mathsf{S}}$ are extracted from the recorded waveforms using a slowness/time coherence processing algorithm (Kimball and Marzetta, 1984). In the process, a semblance function is calculated for a fixed time window across the receiver array, varying traveltimes and velocity within a predefined range to identify peaks in semblance corresponding to individual mode arrivals. Acquisition parameters were configured for the velocity range expected in the deepest part of Hole U1309D ( ${\mathrm{V}}_{\mathsf{P}}={\mathrm{~\,~}}{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathsf{P}}={\mathrm{~\,~}}$ $6{-}7\ \mathrm{km}/{s})$ ).  

# Accelerometry and magnetic field measurement  

The traditional purpose of the General Purpose Inclinometry Tool (GPIT), which includes a three-component accelerometer and a three-component magnetometer, is to determine the acceleration and orientation of the imaging tools. During Expedition 340T, the GPIT was used primarily to provide orientation for the cross-dipole data from the DSI.  

# Vertical seismic profile  

In a VSP experiment, a borehole seismic tool is anchored against the borehole wall at regularly spaced intervals and records the acoustic waves generated by a seismic source positioned just below the sea surface. The first purpose of these measurements is to provide a direct measurement of the time necessary for seismic waves to travel from the surface to a given depth, to tie the observations in the well, recorded as a function of depth, to the reflections observed in the seismic survey data, recorded as a function of time. In addition, analysis of the full waveforms can be used to characterize seismic reflectivity beyond the borehole, which could help document the structure within Atlantis Massif core complex.  

The seismic source for the VSP was a Sercel G-gun parallel cluster, composed of two $250\;\mathrm{in}^{3}$ air guns separated by $1\textrm{m}$ . It was positioned by one of the ship cranes on the port side of the ship at distance of $27.4~\mathrm{m}$ from the centerline of the ship. The setback along the centerline from the top of the wellhead was $35.5\;\mathrm{m}_{}$ , and the total horizontal (diagonal) offset from the wellhead was $44.7~\mathrm{m}$ . The air guns were suspended from a float at a water depth of ${\sim}7\mathrm{~m~}$ , corresponding to a notch frequency of $107\,\mathrm{Hz}$ . The average firing pressure was 1950 psi but noted as varying by up to $\pm50$ psi over the course of operations. Minimum firing interval during VSP operations was $18\ s,$ and pressure recovery after firing was ${\sim}5\mathrm{~s~}$ , so shot-to-shot variations in pressure were minimal. The bubble pulse interval was ${\sim}125~\mathrm{ms}$ .  

During operation, dynamic positioning (DP) maintained the wellhead over Hole U1309D, but the ship’s heading was changed between the 2 days of VSP operation from $335^{\circ}$ on the first day to $040^{\circ}$ on the second. This is significant because the slope of the seafloor is ${\sim}11^{\circ}$ , shoaling most rapidly in a southwest direction. These headings placed the gun array on the updip side of Hole U1309D and increased the chances of recording nonvertical ray paths and polarizations at intermediate depths.  

In accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and of the Endangered Species Act, all seismic activities were conducted during daytime and protected species observers (PSOs) kept watch for protected species during the entire duration of the zero-offset VSP. Any sight of protected species within the exclusion zone of $940\;\mathrm{m}$ (defined for water depths $>1000\;\mathrm{m})$ would interrupt the survey for $60\;\mathrm{min}$ after the last sighting or until the protected species were seen leaving the exclusion zone. PSOs began observations $^{1\mathrm{~h~}}$ prior to the use of the seismic source, which started with a 30 min ramp-up procedure, gradually increasing the operational pressure and firing rate to provide time for undetected protected species to vacate the area. The same ramp-up procedure would be used when resuming activity after any interruption due to the sighting of protected species or whenever the gun was not fired for more than $30\;\mathrm{min}$ .  

The seismometer used was the VSI sensor, a three-axis geophone accelerometer, that was anchored against the borehole prior to recording by a caliper arm. The orientation of the horizontal components, x and y, varies due to sensor rotation during logging, but relative tool orientation during the run is recorded. Data were recorded in three sessions over 2 days. The first session was ended and the tool string recovered when it was determined that the VSI was no longer clamping due to a broken caliper. Recording conditions were very good for the second deployment, and the session ended only because of fading daylight. In contrast, conditions were extremely noisy the following day. The replacement caliper became slightly bent during operations, but noisy conditions were evident from the beginning of recording and persisted during the day; the reason is undiagnosed.  

Data were recorded at 55 station depths between 1645 and 3005 meters below sea level (mbsl), or 0 and 1360 mbsf, corresponding to an average station spacing of 25 m. Stations at 2705, 2955, 2979, and 3005 mbsl were repeated due to failure of the caliper on the first deployment. Stations deeper than 3005 mbsl were not attempted as a precaution against damage to the instrument. A total of 659 shots were recorded; between 5 and 32 recordings were taken at each station with a median of 10.  

# VSP data format description  

The data from the experiment are available in SEGY format for the individual shots $a s\ x-,\ y-$ , and $Z$ -components, the shot break hydrophone, and the automatic stack of traces produced during logging for individual stations. There are 659 traces in both raw data files and in the shot break file, although shot numbers, the third long integer entry in the SEGY header (i.e., 3L), ranges from 3 to 680 with some intermediate shots not recorded. Some unrecorded shots were fired manually between stations to maintain compliance with NEPA. The stacked files have 60 traces rather than 55 because the 4 repeated stations at 2705, 2955, 2979, and $3005~\mathrm{mbsl}$ appear twice, and the station at 1795 mbsl appears twice, as it was reclamped during shooting.  

Trace data are recorded in Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) floating point format with raw data amplitudes reaching almost 900 due to the noise; maximum signal amplitudes are typically ${<}1$ . Start times for the raw traces are the source trigger times uncorrected for the source delay, which can be derived from the shot break records. Recorded maximum shot break amplitudes diminish around Shot 148, possibly due to slight misalignment of the guns; there was no indication of gun malfunction during operations.  

The datum for elevation is the drill rig floor and the receiver group elevation with respect to sea level (Header 11L) is derived from the downhole depth (Header 14L) using a standard $11\textrm{m}$ correction for rig floor. Estimates of the ship’s draft during the VSP put actual elevation of the rig floor at $11.5\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Magnetic Susceptibility Sonde  

The MSS, a wireline tool designed by LDEO, measures the ease with which formations are magnetized when subjected to Earth’s magnetic field. The ease of magnetization is ultimately related to the concentration and composition (size, shape, and mineralogy) of magnetizable material within the formation. These measurements provide one of the best methods for investigating stratigraphic changes in mineralogy and lithology because the measurement is quick, repeatable, and nondestructive and because different lithologies often have strongly contrasting susceptibilities. The sensor used during Expedition 340T was a dual-coil sensor providing deeper reading measurements with a vertical resolution of ${\sim}40~\mathrm{cm}$ . The MSS was run as a component of a Schlumberger tool string, using a specially developed data translation cartridge, saving hours of operation time. For quality control and environmental correction, the MSS also measures internal tool temperature, $Z$ -axis acceleration, and low-resolution borehole conductivity.  

The MSS used during Expedition 340T was run for the first time in seawater in Hole U1309D. Core sample data available from Expeditions 304/305 provide a means to test operational sensitivities of the deep-reading sensor as well as an opportunity to obtain constraints on absolute calibration parameters for the tool.  

# Auxiliary logging equipment  

Cable head  

The Schlumberger logging equipment head (LEH), or cablehead, measures tension at the very top of the wireline tool string, which diagnoses difficulties in running the tool string up or down the borehole, or when exiting or entering the drill string or casing. The LEH-MT used during Expedition 340T also includes a thermal probe to measure the borehole fluid temperature. Several of the Expedition 340T runs encountered difficulty as the tool strings passed out of, or in to, the BHA, as documented by the LEH.  

# Telemetry cartridges  

Telemetry cartridges are used in each tool string to allow the transmission of the data from the tools to the surface. The EDTC also includes a sodium iodide scintillation detector to measure the total natural gamma ray emission of the formation. This gamma ray log was used to match the depths between the different passes and runs. In addition, it includes an accelerometer, whose data can be used in real time to evaluate the efficiency of the wireline heave compensator (WHC). The temperature measurements from the LEH-MT are also processed by the EDTC before being sent to the surface for real-time monitoring.  

# Joints and adapters  

Because the tool strings combine tools of different generations and with various designs, they include several adapters and joints between individual tools to allow communication, provide isolation, avoid interferences (mechanical and acoustic), terminate wirings, or to position the tool properly in the borehole. The knuckle joints in particular were used to allow some of the tools such as the HRLA to remain centralized in the borehole, while the overlying HLDS was simultaneously pressed against the borehole wall by an eccentralizing arm.  

All these additions contribute to the total length of the tool strings and are included in Figure F4.  

# Log data quality  

A principal factor in the quality of log data is the condition of the borehole wall. If the borehole diameter varies over short intervals because of washouts or ledges, the logs from tools that require good contact with the borehole wall (i.e., density tool in the Expedition 340T program) may be degraded. Deep investigation measurements such as gamma ray, resistivity, and sonic velocity, which do not require contact with the borehole wall, are generally less sensitive to borehole conditions. Very narrow (“bridged”) sections will also cause irregular log results. For the VSI, cable motion and/or ship noise can also be an important factor controlling data quality.  

The quality of the logging depth determination depends on several factors. The depth of the logging measurements is determined from the length of the cable played out from the winch on the ship. Uncertainties in the depth of the core samples occur because of incomplete core recovery or incomplete heave compensation. Uncertainties in logging depth occur because of ship heave, cable stretch, cable slip, or even tidal changes. All these factors generate some discrepancy between core sample depths, logs, and individual logging passes. To minimize the effect of ship heave, a hydraulic wireline heave compensator is used to adjust the wireline length for rig motion during wireline logging operations.  

# Wireline heave compensator  

Expedition 340T continued to evaluate the WHC system. It is designed to compensate for the vertical motion of the ship and maintain steady motion of the logging tools downhole. It uses vertical acceleration measurements made by a motion reference unit (MRU), located under the rig floor near the center of gravity of the ship, to calculate the vertical motion of the ship. It then adjusts the length of the wireline by varying the distance between two sets of pulleys through which the cable passes. Realtime measurements of uphole (surface) and downhole acceleration are made simultaneously by the MRU and by the EDTC tool, respectively. An LDEO-developed software package allows these data to be analyzed and compared in real time, displaying the actual motion of the logging tool string, and enabling evaluation of the efficiency of the compensator. Observations during Expedition 340T neither confirm nor disprove the effectiveness of this system. The best signal-to-noise ratio VSI recordings were obtained when the WHC was turned off and stations were relatively shallow (shallower than 1810 meters below rig floor [mbrf] [150 mbsf]). However, sea conditions on a subsequent run when signal-to-noise ratio was poor and the WHC was in use were somewhat different so interpretation of the difference is difficult. Three stations recorded with the WHC off during that run did not result in a recognizable difference in noise levels on the VSI trace.  

# Logging data flow and processing  

Data for each wireline logging run were monitored in real time and recorded using the Schlumberger MAXIS 500 system. They were then copied to the shipboard processing stations for preliminary processing. Each pass was depth matched to logs from Expeditions 304 and 305. After depth-match processing, all the logging depths were shifted to the seafloor. This is usually done by identifying the seafloor from a step in gamma radiation, but in this case the logs were shifted using the depth to seafloor established from previous expeditions to Hole U1309D. These data were made available to the science party within a day after their acquisition.  

The downhole log data were also transferred onshore to LDEO for standardized data processing. The main part of the processing is depth matching to remove depth offsets between different logging passes, which results in a new depth scale: wireline matched depth below seafloor (WMSF). Also, additional corrections are made to certain tools and logs (e.g., speed and voltage corrections to resistivity images), documentation for the logs (with an assessment of log quality) is prepared, and the data are converted to ASCII for the conventional logs and to SEGY for the VSP data. Schlumberger GeoQuest’s GeoFrame software package is used for most of the processing.  

# Operations summary  

The vessel arrived on location at $2230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 February 2012 after making a rapid passage from Lisbon, Portugal, with an average transit speed of $12.37~\mathrm{kt}$ over the 1713 nmi distance. The R/V JOIDES Resolution’s excellent transit speed can most likely be attributed to a recently cleaned hull, newly polished propellers, and favorable winds and seas. During the transit to the first site, the drilling and logging equipment was inspected and tested to ensure performance during Expedition 340T operations. Prior to the start of logging operations, a presite meeting was held with Siem Offshore staff, IODP staff, the Chief Scientist, and other critical staff.  

On arrival at Site U1309, the speed of the vessel was reduced and bridge control was shifted to DP control at 2257 h. Drill floor operations began immediately after switching to DP control. First, the upper guide horn was laid out, the BHA for logging operations was picked up and assembled, and the drilling string was run to the seafloor. Despite preoperational checks, the iron roughneck torquing system failed during the initial pipe trip. While troubleshooting the hydraulic problem, tripping continued using manual tongs and a rope to spin in the drill pipe. The vibration-isolated television (VIT) frame was installed while tripping to the bottom, and at $1015\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 February we began spacing out the bit for reentry into Hole U1309D. What appeared to be the reentry cone was identified almost immediately, and the vessel was positioned for a reentry at ${\sim}1115\,\mathrm{h}$ . The reentry attempt was made but was unsuccessful, primarily because the assumed reentry cone was in fact a conelike seafloor structure. A bottom survey was then conducted to locate the Hole U1309D reentry cone. It was located and reentered at $1320\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 February. After reentry the logging bit was positioned at 1711 mbrf, which is below known problem sections in Hole U1309D.  

The triple combo tool string was rigged up by $1440\;\mathrm{h}$ on 21 February and lowered to the hole. The tool string was run into the hole, recording standard measurements as well as an in situ temperature profile from the surface to 3060 mbrf. At $0050\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 February, the tool string was completely back in the pipe but unable to pass through the BHA. After working the logging string for ${>}4~\mathrm{h}$ , the decision was made to use the Kinley crimper/cutter to crimp and cut the logging cable. After deploying two crimping systems and a cutter, the cable was cut and retrieved. The VIT frame was then run to the seabed to verify that the tools were present at the end of the bit. The drill bit cleared the reentry cone at $1410\,\mathrm{h}$ . The bottom of the logging tool string was visually observed hanging out of the end of the bit. The drill string was then pulled to surface and a stand of the BHA was set back. The logging tools were removed from the last drill collar with care. All tools were successfully recovered including the radioactive source. It was immediately apparent that both centralizers had failed. The center section of the centralizers appears to have been severely abraded by the formation, likely breaking during pipe reentry. After rigging down the logging tools, the drill string was tripped back into the hole. The VIT frame was then deployed but had to be retrieved for repairs after one of the lights failed. On redeployment the lighting system failed again. The VIT frame was again pulled back and an electronics pod was changed. At $0515\mathrm{~h~}$ on 23 February, the VIT frame was again installed and then run to bottom. The vessel was positioned for reentry into Hole U1309D, which occurred at $0705\mathrm{~h~}$ . The drill string was run into the hole to 1711 mbrf. The VIT frame was retrieved.  

A protected species watch was initiated at $0630~\mathrm{h}$ on 23 February, and the seismic source (a G-gun parallel cluster of two $250\,\mathrm{in}^{3}$ air guns) was deployed 7 mbsl, in preparation for a VSP experiment. After $1~\mathrm{h}$ with no protected species sightings, the seismic guns were soft-started and ramped up to full pressure over the course of the next $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$ . The guns then remained on standby but were fired at least once every $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$ until the VSP experiment began. The VSI tool string was rigged up at $0815\,\mathrm{h}$ and run into the hole. The first seismic station was established at 1805 mbrf, and the first shot of the VSP was fired. After a successful first station, the tool string was run to the bottom of the hole to the deepest station at 3016 mbrf. At 3016 mbrf and four successively shallower stations, data indicated that the VSI was not clamping properly. After a period of troubleshooting, the tool was pulled back to surface, where it was confirmed that the caliper was broken. A second VSI sonde was substituted into the tool string, and it was run back into the hole for $^{1\mathrm{~h~}}$ of logging before sunset. Three stations were completed, and VSP operations ended for the day because of darkness. The VSI tool string was pulled back to surface and rigged down by $1910\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

The DSI (sonic) tool string was run next. Given that it used the same centralizers as the triple combo, a decision was made to only log the deep portion of the hole that had not been logged during Expedition 305. The logging bit was tripped down to $2356~\mathrm{mbrf},$ , or $700~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . The pipe trip identified further ledges at 1723, 1726, and 1740 mbrf. The passive heave compensator had to be opened up to pass these ledges. At $2200\ \mathrm{h}$ , the DSI tool string was rigged up and run into the hole. The tool string started taking weight inside the BHA and could not be run down to the depth of the drill bit. After unsuccessfully working the tool string for $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ to pass the BHA, the tool string was pulled back to surface and rigged down at $0330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 February. Initially there was a concern that something was either damaged or obstructing the BHA. An extended core barrel (XCB) was rigged up and run on wireline to verify that the BHA was free and clear to the bit. After verifying that the BHA was clear, the investigation turned to the DSI tool string. An obstruction was identified at one of the centralizers. The centralizers were cleaned of all rubberized backing material, and this allowed the sonic tool string to clear the landing seat.  

While the centralizers were being fixed, the VSI tool string was rigged up and run into the hole to begin the second day of the VSP experiment. The protected species watch began again at $0630\,\mathrm{h}_{}$ , and the G-gun cluster was deployed and ramped up following the same method as the previous day. The VSI tool string was run into the hole at $0725\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 February. The VSP experiment continued through the day and was completed prior to dusk. The tool string was then pulled to the surface and rigged down. The logging bit was tripped to $2356~\mathrm{mbrf},$ , or 700 mbsf past the identified ledges at 1723, 1726, and 1740 mbrf. Again, the passive heave compensator had to be opened up to pass these ledges.  

At $2020\,\mathrm{h}$ , the DSI tool string was rigged up for a second deployment. The tool string was successfully run through the BHA to 3040 mbrf and back up to the surface with no difficulties. The logging run was concluded at $0435\mathrm{~h~}$ on 25 February, when the tools were rigged down on the drill floor.  

The drill pipe was tripped back to 1759 mbrf so that the upper portion of the hole could be logged with the MSS tool string, which was the final logging run in Hole U1309D. The MSS tool is temperature-limited to $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{i}$ , so the tool string was run into the hole and recorded data from a maximum depth of 2419 mbrf up to the drill pipe. The tool string was run back down, and a repeat pass was recorded from 2165 mbrf up to the surface. By $1030\,\mathrm{h}$ , the tools were back on the surface and rigged down. The drill string was pulled clear of the reentry cone at $1055\,\mathrm{h}$ and spaced out for a bottom survey.  

A seafloor survey was started from Hole U1309D by moving $5\;\mathrm{m}$ east, then 5 m south, and then $10\,\mathrm{m}$ west in an expanding spiral. The survey was concluded after $1.5\,\mathrm{h}$ . An attempt was made to retrieve a sample from a moundlike feature on the seafloor at $30^{\circ}10.1179^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $042^{\circ}07.1118^{\prime}{\mathrm{W}}.$ The bit was set down inside the conelike opening of the feature, and a modified advanced piston core (APC) core barrel was lowered by wireline and run into the bottom twice to attempt to sample the material inside the feature. After IODP Hole U1392A was spudded at $1447\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{.}}$ , the core barrel was retrieved and laid out on the drill floor, and the sample was extracted for processing by the technical staff. The drilling string was then pulled back to the drill floor, and the drill collars were secured in the their racks, the upper guide horn was reinstalled, and the rig floor was secured for transit at $2030\,\mathrm{h}$ . The thrusters were then raised, and a magnetometer survey was started. The expedition ended with the JOIDES Resolution running two crossing lines with the magnetometer above Site U1309 and preparing to get under way to San Juan, Puerto Rico.  

# Principal results  

Measurements of borehole properties form the majority of Expedition 340T results. VSP data extend the new information out to a region including a few hundred meters distance from the 1415 mbsf deep hole at Site U1309. In addition to logging in Hole U1309D, observations of the nearby seafloor were made with the VIT camera. One previously unrecognized feature generated sufficient interest that a brief sampling effort was made there. A small amount of material was successfully recovered, and the location was designated Site U1392. A map of these IODP sites on the Central Dome of Atlantis Massif shows the spatial relationship between Expedition 304/305 Holes U1309A–U1309E and Expedition 340T Hole U1392A (Fig. F5).  

# Site U1309  

All components of the planned logging program in Hole U1309D were successfully conducted during Expedition 340T. The triple combo, sonic, and magnetic susceptibility runs produced high-quality data. The majority of the VSP data are noisy and will require substantial postprocessing. However, a few stations in the upper $150\,\mathrm{m}$ of the section recorded clear, strong seismic arrivals, thus providing in situ constraints on average properties across the zone inferred to be most strongly affected by detachment processes at the Central Dome. The details and timing of logging operations in Hole U1309D are given in Table T2.  

The reentry cone for Hole U1309D was approached slowly as the ship positioned to get the logging bit into the borehole. Several observers carefully watched the VIT video for indication of possible seawater flow from the opening, but none was seen, so reentry proceeded without delay.  

# Data quality  

The main logs recorded by the triple combo, sonic, and magnetic susceptibility tool strings in Hole U1309D are displayed in Figures F6, F7, and F8. Borehole size and shape measured by the calipers are general indicators of data quality. Hole U1309D is larger and more irregular in the upper $750\;\mathrm{m}$ , where borehole diameter ranges from ${\sim}11$ to 18 inches, whereas the lower ${\sim}650\;\mathrm{m}$ is generally more regular in shape with a diameter closer to bit size (Fig. F6). Anomalously low density values in the wider, irregular sections of the hole are a consequence of the inability of the tool sensors to make full contact with the borehole wall. The gamma ray and deep resistivity measurements should not be affected by the size of the borehole.  

The clear arrivals in the monopole waveforms and the high coherence in the compressional and shear velocity tracks shown in Figure F7 indicate that the DSI was able to measure reliable velocity values.  

Magnetic susceptibility, measured with the deep-reading sensor of the MSS, should be fairly insensitive to standoff from the borehole wall. The MSS is a relatively new logging tool that was not available during Expedition 304/305; however, the reliability of the magnetic susceptibility log can be assessed by comparison with measurements made on Expedition 304/305 core pieces with the multisensor track (MST) system. Figure F8 shows good agreement between the two data sets, tracking meter-scale highamplitude features at the same depths. MSS data are not yet calibrated for temperature, and the offset between the down, main, and repeat passes is most likely due to the variation in internal tool temperature between the runs (see temperature track, Fig. F8).  

The comparison between hole size from Expeditions 304/305 and 340T in Figure F9 shows that the hole has not changed appreciably in the 7 y since it was last occupied. Intervals with a rough, irregular shape are indicated in the same areas, and distinct features are clearly repeated between the data sets. During the triple combo deployment of Expedition 340T, the caliper measured hole diameter to be ${<}6$ inches between 1387 and 1404 mbsf, suggesting that the lower ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{m}$ of the hole may contain some fall-in material. The small-diameter interval recorded between 630 and 655 mbsf in Expedition 305 data was due to tool failure and should not be interpreted as the hole having changed in diameter. Gamma radiation, density, resistivity, and sonic velocity data show good repeatability between the three sets of logs where coverage overlaps.  

# Scientific results  

A steady increase in borehole fluid temperature with depth was documented, and a value of $146.2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ was recorded at 1405 mbsf (Fig. F10). This is ${\sqrt{20^{\circ}C}}$ hotter than the maximum temperature recorded in the hole at the end Expedition 305, when drilling and flushing had altered conditions considerably. The present temperature profile is quasilinear as a simple conductive model would predict for equilibrium conditions, but modest deviations do exist, as discussed in “Discussion.” The few-degree dips in temperature observed in the Expedition 305 Temperature/Acceleration/Pressure data (black curve, Fig. F10) are not apparent in the 340T data until the dominant linear trend is removed; then dips of a fraction of a degree Celsius are visible near 1100 and $\mathord{\sim}750$ mbsf.  

The Expedition 340T VSP data are noisy enough that the automated stack computed during acquisition produced only a few reasonable quality traces. A preliminary assessment was made of the quality for individual shots using a $10{-}60\ \mathrm{Hz}$ band-pass filter and a sliding short time window centered on the predicted arrival time (see “Appendix”). Arrival time predictions were generated from vertical integration of the sonic log data and also one-dimensional velocity modeling for the hole taken from a 3-D tomography model of Atlantis Massif developed from surface MCS data (Henig et al., in press) (Fig. F11). The maximum difference in predicted arrival times from these two models is $8\;\mathrm{ms}$ . Predicted times were adjusted for the gun firing delay $({\sim}28~\mathrm{ms})$ , gun depth $(5\;\mathrm{ms})$ , and a predicted time advance due to the sloping seafloor $({\sim}13\;\mathrm{ms})$ . First arrivals from 93 out of the 659 shots, corresponding to 33 of the 55 station depths, were graded as excellent to very good on at least one channel, primarily the vertical component (Tables T4, T5). Although necessarily subjective, an arrival was graded as excellent (value of 4 in Table T4) if the trace was quiet before the first break and a reliable traveltime could be picked directly from the trace. A “very good” arrival (value of 3 in Table T4) was one for which a reliable traveltime is expected to be obtainable by stacking and/or waveform cross-correlation. The good VSP stations for Expedition 340T thus range from 86 to $1360~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , extending coverage beyond the Expedition 305 data interval of 272–792 mbsf (Collins et al., 2009). An example of excellent quality data on all three components is displayed in Figure F12 for the new station at $150~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . If relative station amplitudes are reliable, these traces indicate that the first arrival arrives with direction $\mathrm{\sim}30^{\circ}$ from the vertical. The single good arrival for the deepest station at 1360 mbsf is displayed in Figure F13, arriving just before the model prediction.  

The most significant new data are the sonic logs recorded below 820 mbsf where no velocities were measured at the end of Expedition 305. These data are the first in situ measurements of the velocity of gabbros typical of oceanic lower crust, with $V_{\mathsf{P}}$ reaching values $>7000\;\mathrm{m/s}.$ ${\cal{V}}_{\mathsf{P}}$ and $V_{5}$ show little variation in the main gabbroic zone between $\mathord{\sim}760$ and $\mathord{\sim}1070$ mbsf, reflecting the mostly uniform composition in this zone (Blackman, Ildefonse, John, Ohara, Miller, MacLeod, and the Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006). Deeper in the hole, velocity seems to reflect the variation in composition, with high variability in the olivine-rich troctolite interval between 1070 and 1230 mbsf and steady values below this depth where gabbros are again dominant (Fig. F7).  

In addition to the high-frequency $({\sim}12\,\mathrm{kHz})$ waveforms used for the velocity logs, the same transducers were used to generate low-frequency $({\sim}500\,\mathrm{Hz})$ Stoneley waveforms that can be used to identify fractures or permeable intervals. When they encounter fractures, Stoneley waves propagating in the borehole are reflected, with the reflectivity dependent on the openness and permeability of the fracture (Hornby et al., 1989). The chevron-shaped patterns that can be seen at various depths in the Stoneley waveforms in Figure F7 are generated by such fracture-induced reflectivity. Figure F14 shows that the fracture responsible for these patterns around 1345 mbsf is a $30~\mathrm{{cm}}$ thick northeast-dipping fracture that is clearly identified in the Formation MicroScanner (FMS) images recorded during Expedition 305 logging operations.  

This expedition marked the first sea trial of the deep-reading sensor of the newly rebuilt LDEO MSS. Figure F15 shows finer scale variations of core and log susceptibility with lithology from Blackman, Ildefonse, John, Ohara, Miller, MacLeod, and the Expedition 304/305 Scientists (2006) between 170 and 400 mbsf. The background gabbroic rocks in Hole U1309D have relatively low susceptibility, whereas highest values (or highest amplitude features) are associated with intervals of oxide gabbro and highly serpentinized ultramafic rocks (e.g., olivine-rich troctolite, dunite, and harzburgite). There is a very good correlation between the magnetic susceptibility logs and the lithologies that have a high content of ferro- and ferrimagnetic minerals.  

# Site U1392  

A seafloor feature located $3\,\mathrm{m}$ south and $2\,\mathrm{m}$ east of the reentry cone for Hole U1309D caught our interest during Expedition 340T. It was first seen shortly after the seafloor came into view on the VIT camera, as the positioning for reentry was starting. The circular shape of the feature and distinct coloring relative to surrounding seafloor gave the impression that it was the (still distant) reentry cone, so we dynamic positioned to it. Additional characteristics became evident with closer view (Fig. F16). A distinct rim separates the center of the feature from surrounding material. Outside the rim, concentric or stacked intervals are distinguishable from the observed shadow pattern. Inside the rim, partial darker shadow is suggestive of an opening, but otherwise the imagery there lacks structure as might be typical for unconsolidated sediment. The VIT imagery is not high quality, but these characteristics were clearly and repeatedly observed at the feature, being more evident in video than in single frames. This feature was named Decoy mound due to our initial misinterpretation that it was the reentry cone for Hole U1309D with sediment encrusted on/around/below it.  

The $\sim\!2\textrm{m}$ diameter, $1{-}2\textrm{m}$ high Decoy mound was initially interpreted as a deposit formed since IODP was last at Site U1309 (February 2005). Its solid, possibly cylindrical wall, of thickness comparable to the diameter of the drill bit $({\sim}25\;\mathrm{cm})$ , has outside morphology that is characteristic of geothermal deposition: rounded or bulbous layers that vary in thickness (distance?) from the main rim diameter. The rim (top of the wall?) has somewhat irregular shape but is clearly distinct from the interior material. The height of the feature varies around its circumference. The logging bit could only penetrate $1\mathrm{-}2\textrm{m}$ below the rim before encountering a solid interface that could not be pushed through. It is this interface that was sampled as Hole U1392A.  

The motivation for sampling was to test the inference that Decoy mound included (or was solely) geothermal deposits, whose composition might provide insight into any fluids responsible for the growth or, perhaps, simply lithification of preexisting or concurrently deposited sediments. The fact that the actual reentry cone for Hole U1309D was relatively sediment free (Fig. F16) indicates that background marine deposition since 2005 has not been significant.  

There was not sufficient time after the primary work of Expedition 340T (logging) to run pipe, change the logging bit to an APC bit, and return to the seafloor for a sample, so an alternate strategy was devised. A modified APC bit was lowered in the pipe to 1500 mbrf and held there while the ship was positioned over Decoy mound. The drill string was pushed into contact with the impenetrable surface below the rim and held there. The cable tension was freed, allowing the barrel to obtain a gravity core, with intent that the flapper valve could retain material penetrated. Cable was reeled in to position the barrel again near 1500 mbrf and then tension released for a repeat sampling attempt. The core barrel was recovered after this second drop. The core catcher contained a small amount of material that was catalogued as Sample 340T-U1392A1M-CC, the $\mathbf{\omega}^{\prime\prime}\mathbf{M}^{\prime\prime}$ indicating miscellaneous sample type.  

Core 340T-U1392A-1M contained ${\sim}17~\mathrm{g}$ of mixed rock fragments and some microfossils (Fig. F17A). Four types of material were recognized during visual inspection by nonexpert geoscientists onboard. About a third of the sample consists of sharp-edged, platy fragments (Fig. F17B) that are black on one side when wet and rust-colored on the other side. The black side is commonly finely striated. A few angular grains of possible fault rock are milky or translucent and white-blue in color (Fig. F17C), reminiscent of the talc-tremolite schist obtained in prior Atlantis Massif studies (Boschi et al., 2006; Blackman, Ildefonse, John, Ohara, Miller, MacLeod, and the Expedition 304/ 305 Scientists, 2006). Lithified carbonate pebbles also make up a few percent of the sample, and these pieces incorporate a variety of other material as tiny grains (Fig. F17D). The majority of the sample consists of dark green-gray angular subcentimetersized fragments (Fig. F17E) mixed with tiny grains of the previously described rock chip types. Microfossils also were obtained in this sample, as can be seen in this image.  

# Discussion  

Preliminary findings for Expedition 340T fall into the following categories: (1) seismic structure of the intrusive crust within the domal core of Atlantis Massif and correlation of meter-scale velocity with general lithology, alteration, and fault zones; (2) inferences about localized fluid flow and deformation at the site based on seafloor imagery and downhole temperature; and (3) magnetic susceptibility of the borehole rock and potential for insights on relative timing of serpentinization. Most results were obtained by logging Hole U1309D, but brief camera surveys and opportunistic sampling in the new Hole U1392A added to our findings.  

We have obtained the first in situ measurement of intrusive oceanic crust, which typically comprises seismic Layer 3. The Expedition 340T sonic logs indicate that the little-altered section from 800 to 1400 mbsf has mean compressional velocity of $6.6\,\mathrm{km}/$ s and mean shear velocity of $3.7~\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ (Fig. F18). This average excludes the olivinerich troctolite interval at 1070–1220 mbsf that has several highly serpentinized intervals. The multimeter-scale sonic log average is an appropriate value for the inherent seismic properties of a gabbroic section. When postprocessing of the VSP data is complete, we will obtain a site average ${\cal{V}}_{\mathsf{P}}$ for this intrusive crustal section that will include any effects of fracturing at the $100\;\mathrm{m}$ scale such as may be associated with OCC development.  

Useful VSP stations bracket the range of lithologies and alteration that occur in Hole U1309D (Fig. F19). Only a single station from Expedition 305 is located in the interval above the upper olivine-rich troctolites (310–350 mbsf) but well below the diabase units that are common in the upper 130 mbsf.  

The Expedition 340T sonic log confirms that olivine-rich troctolite intervals have sufficient velocity contrast with surrounding rock to be responsible for reflectivity observed in surface seismic data (Fig. F18). The 750 mbsf fault zone also has significant seismic and density contrast, but its $20{-}30\;\mathrm{m}$ thickness is at the margin of observability, relative to subseafloor seismic wavelengths. However, if pore fluid presently exists there, as suggested by the temperature dip measured in this zone (Fig. F20A), this could enhance the impedance contrast and produce a reflector despite the narrow interval. An additional reflector occurs at $1340\,\mathrm{mbsf}$ , as is most easily seen in the Stoneley wave results (Fig. F7). This is the first recognition of this zone as having distinctive properties—Expedition 304/305 core/logging analyses did not highlight this interval, but a retrospective review of FMS, borehole density, porosity, and photoelectric data does show it as a distinctive, narrow interval.  

Small deviations from a downhole conductive thermal gradient provide another indication that narrow depth intervals within the domal core of Atlantis Massif have distinctive properties, and, likely, currently active processes. In addition to the temperature dip associated with the 750 mbsf fault zone mentioned above, a similar small dip $(0.3^{\circ}{-}0.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$ , relative to the local linear gradient) is observed at the 1100 mbsf fault zone (Fig. F20). Our preliminary interpretation of these signals is that slow percolation of seawater (cooler temperature $[T]$ when it initially enters a fracture network at the seafloor, whether at or laterally displaced from Site U1309) occurs, made possible by modest porosity within these zones. The maximum vertical extent of each zone is $10{-}20\;\mathrm{m}$ based on the limit of the $T$ deviation. Michibayashi et al. (2008) determine a ${\sim}6\textrm{m}$ thickness for the fault zone at 750 mbsf on the basis of borehole resistivity, gamma ray, and density anomalies. Borehole structure imaged in Expedition 304/305 FMS data tends to dip east in a central $^1\textrm{m}$ interval of this zone, in contrast to the general north–south dip of the structures above and below. Low resistivity and positive gamma ray and neutron porosity signatures in the fault zone are consistent with the presence of a conductive phase such as seawater.  

The downhole temperature profile has 2–3 modest breaks in slope; characterizing their location and investigating potential reasons for the changes in gradient will be addressed in postcruise research. In general, the increase in temperature with depth is greater in the lower half of the hole than at shallower depths.  

The absolute value of the Expedition 340T downhole magnetic susceptibility correlates very well with the measured susceptibility of the core obtained during Expeditions 304 and 305. Essentially every MST peak (for smoothed data that reduces core edge artifacts) corresponds to an MSS anomaly (Fig. F8). Beyond the multimeter-scale correlation that we determined via shipboard analysis, more detailed documentation of the borehole thickness of oxide gabbro units will be possible. Some of the cores with this lithology had low recovery during Expeditions 304/305, as their extremely large grain size was conducive to breakup of the core into biscuit-size pieces and resulted in an unknown amount of material loss. More relevant for the goals of Expedition 340T, it appears there may be information on the relative timing of serpentinization of olivine-rich troctolite units. Using just the basic rock name from the Expedition 304/305 unit log, there is a clear association of relative lows in recorded MSS value and the olivine-rich troctolite units in the 300–350 mbsf section (Fig. F15). This warrants further investigation, and more detailed information on both primary and alteration mineralogy should be brought to bear in analyses to determine how/whether it is serpentinization that is key or some other factor(s). If it is the serpentinized intervals that correlate with the submeter-scale drops in MSS values, then inference of an opposite polarity of the magnetic field during alteration, relative to the reversed polarity that dominated throughout cooling of the igneous section, might be appropriate.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Most components of Expedition 340T were successful, and the new data will allow us to address aspects of lithospheric hydration associated with oceanic core complex formation and evolution, as was our aim at the outset.  

Two aspects of the temperature log data are relevant and are expected to help constrain new models of slow flow within narrow subsurface fault zones and broader scale (several tens to hundreds meter scale) cooling of the uplifted core of Atlantis Massif: (1) the small dips in value associated with two documented faults and (2) the distinct intervals of linear thermal gradient that differ downhole.  

Sources of seismic reflectivity within the intrusive core of the massif have been identified in the Expedition 340T sonic logs. Notable impedance contrasts are associated with differences in physical properties of the olivine-rich troctolite intervals compared to surrounding lithologies. The fact that portions of these intervals are highly serpentinized means that MCS and waveform inversion methods can be expected to provide insight into the distribution of these types of subsurface hydration pathway. The combination of sonic and downhole temperature data suggests that the 750 mbsf fault zone could reflect comparable amounts of seismic energy. This will need to be assessed more carefully by modeling the volume of percolative flow needed to produce the observed temperature drop within that interval and estimating associated pore fluid volumes within the zone. Logged porosity and postcruise Stoneley wave analysis may also provide constraints in this regard.  

With the data we obtained at the quietest VSP stations, an average velocity will be determined for the upper $150\;\mathrm{m}$ of the Central Dome, and this will allow us to address properties of the exposed detachment zone, which include hydration (alteration mineralogy) as well as deformation (porosity, in this case) that wave speeds are sensitive to.  

Some of the information that we hoped to obtain as part of the zero-offset VSP experiment could not be obtained due to operational limitations.  

It is likely not possible to record reflectors in this type of geologic setting with the approach used on the JOIDES Resolution for obtaining VSPs. The borehole seismometer needs to be decoupled from cable motion, and perhaps, environmental noise (ship? pipe against hole?) may need to be reduced in order to succeed at this next level of seismic investigation. We recommend that this information be made available to all scientists expressing interest in (at least hard rock) VSP work within IODP. Decoupling the sensor from cable motion would also reduce the likelihood of the clamping arm bending or breaking, as was experienced during two of the three VSP runs during Expedition 340T. Seas were moderate, not high, at the times of our VSP work, so our problems in this regard do not appear to reflect use in extreme conditions.  

We recognize the need to comply with the designated JOIDES Resolution protected species mitigation plan. The PSO watches and VSP work were carried out well and in accordance with this plan. Because future IODP expeditions may benefit, we note that if we had been able to continue air gun shots into the evening hours on 24 February, our VSI data set may have been significantly better than it is. For whatever combination of reasons (clamping arm not bent? less ship/cable noise?) the 24 February VSP run was the only one to produce consistently good quality data. Acquisition might have extended to additional (and deeper) stations if we had been able to continue under those conditions. For projects where VSP work is of high priority, IODP may want to explore developing a mitigation plan designed to allow evening seismic source operations.  

Less-than-optimum selection of design, possibly material, of the centralizer arms impacted our operations. If we had not arrived on site early, due to very rapid transit, and if the USIO had not been willing to allow us to use this extra time for our work, we would have failed in our attempt to document the seismic properties of the lower portion of Hole U1309D. About 2 days were required for our team to recognize and learn how to address this problem in order to have successful DSI and VSI runs.  

Higher than usual (for IODP) temperature in this hole may be a factor in the significant wear and failure of the centralizer arms. It is not out of the question that borehole chemistry also played a role (but this has not been tested), since Lost City hydrothermal vent field a few kilometers south of Site U1309 is known to have highpH fluid. Measured fluid resistivity in the borehole does deviate from standard seawater values in the lower parts of the hole.  

The rapid transit from Lisbon, Portugal, to Site U1309 introduced an unexpected set of activities—the potential for extra time on site meant that additional science related to both Expeditions 340T and 304/305 might be addressed. The ship’s management, technical and drill crews, and onshore personnel were all very helpful as we explored this possibility. Their willingness to adjust onboard workflow during Expedition 340T to accommodate a modest amount of unexpected coring is recognized and very much appreciated. In the end just a single sampling effort was possible; even this reflected the onboard group’s ability to be creative in order to take advantage of a scientific opportunity. By rigging a modified APC bit/barrel and deploying it from $150~\mathrm{m}$ above seafloor within the drill pipe, we obtained what was essentially a gravity core. The fragments of rock and gravel recovered show promise for providing worthwhile geochemical and microstructural information on the uppermost surface of the detachment exposed on the dome of Atlantis Massif.

# Appendix  

# Matlab scripts  

The Matlab scripts in this section were used to make a preliminary assessment of data quality from the Expedition 340T VSP. The scripts present time-windowed and bandpass filtered versions of all sensor components, shot-by-shot, for a single VSP station. The window is a short time interval based upon time integration of a 1-D velocity model for the hole (see “Principal results”). Time integration of the sonic log data gives essentially the same predictions. The main script is “cull_vsp_data.” It uses “rdsegy_full” to ready the SEGY versions of the VSP data and “butter_filt” to apply a band-pass Butterworth causal filter.
