# Introduction  

This chapter documents the procedures and methods employe d in the various shipboard laboratories of the drillship R/V JOIDE S Resolution during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP ) Expedition 361. The information applies only to shipboard work described in the Expedition Reports section of the Expedition 36 1 Proceedings of the International Ocean Discovery Program volume. Methods used by investigators for shore-based analyses of Expedition 361 data will be described in separate, individual publications. This introductory section provides an overview of operations, curatorial conventions, depth scale terminology, and general core handling and analyses.

# Site locations  

GPS coordinates from precruise site surveys were used to position the vessel at all Expedition 361 sites. A Syquest Bathy 201 0 CHIRP subbottom profiler was used to monitor the seafloor dept h on the approach to each site to reconfirm the depth profiles fro m precruise surveys. Once the vessel was positioned at a site, th e thrusters were lowered and a positioning beacon was dropped t o the seafloor. The dynamic positioning control of the vessel use d navigational input from the GPS and triangulation to the seafloo r beacon, weighted by the estimated positional accuracy. The final position for each hole of a given site was the mean position calculated from GPS data collected over a significant portion of the tim e the hole was occupied.  

# Coring and drilling operations  

The advanced piston corer (APC), half-length advanced pisto n corer (HLAPC), and extended core barrel (XCB) systems were use d during Expedition 361. At Sites U1474–U1479, multiple holes wer e drilled to build a composite depth scale and a stratigraphic splice fo r continuous subsampling after the cruise (see Sample depth calculations and Measurements and methods for correlation).  

The APC and HLAPC cut soft-sediment cores with minima l coring disturbance relative to other IODP coring systems. After th e APC core barrel is lowered through the drill pipe and lands near th e bit, the drill pipe is pressured up until two shear pins that hold th e inner barrel attached to the outer barrel fail. The inner barrel the n advances into the formation and cuts the core. The driller can detect a successful cut, or “full stroke,” from the pressure gauge on th e rig floor.  

The depth limit of the APC, often referred to as APC refusal, i s indicated in two ways: (1) the piston consistently fails to achieve  a complete stroke (as determined from the pump pressure reading ) because the formation is too hard and limited core recovery i s achieved or (2) excessive force $^{\prime}{>}60{,}000$ lb; ${\sim}267~\mathrm{kN})$ ) is required t o pull the core barrel out of the formation. When a full stroke can no t be achieved, one or more additional attempts are typically made, and each time the bit is advanced by the length of recovered core. Note that this results in a nominal recovery of ${\sim}100\%$ based on th e assumption that the barrel penetrated the formation by the lengt h of core recovered. When a full or partial stroke is achieved but excessive force cannot retrieve the barrel, the core barrel is sometime s “drilled over,” meaning after the inner core barrel was shot into th e formation, the drill bit is advanced to total depth to free the AP C barrel.  

The standard APC system contains a $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel; th e HLAPC uses a $4.7\,\textrm{m}$ long core barrel. In most instances, th e HLAPC is deployed after the standard APC reaches refusal. Durin g use of the HLAPC, the same criteria are applied in terms of refusa l as for the full-length APC system. Use of the HLAPC allows for significantly greater APC sampling depths to be attained.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used for all of the deployment s of the APC and HLAPC. Steel core barrels were used for the XC B system. Orientation using the IceField MI-5 and FlexIt core orientation tools (see Paleomagnetism) was applied on standard AP C cores taken in selected holes at each site. Formation temperatur e measurements were made at Site U1474 to obtain temperature gradients and heat flow estimates using the advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) (see Physical properties). The APCT- 3 was not utilized at the other sites because it was noted that cor e quality was adversely affected when the core barrel remained in th e sediment for the time required by the APCT-3 measurement.  

The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) is the lowermost part of th e drill string. A typical APC/XCB BHA consists of a drill bit (oute r diameter $=11\%$ inches $\left[{\sim}29.05\;\mathrm{cm}\right]\}$ ), bit sub, seal bore drill collar, landing saver sub, modified top sub, modified head sub, nonmagnetic drill collar (for APC/XCB), a number of $8\%$ inch $({\sim}20.32\;\mathrm{cm})$ drill collars, tapered drill collar, six joints (two stands) of $5\%$ inc h $({\sim}13.97\;\mathrm{cm})$ drill pipe, and one crossover sub.  

# Drilling disturbance  

Cores may be significantly disturbed as a result of the drillin g process and contain extraneous material as a result of the corin g and core-handling processes. The uppermost $10{-}50~\mathrm{cm}$ of eac h core must therefore be examined critically during description fo r potential “cave-in” and other disturbances (e.g., fluidization relate d to drill string heave in poor weather conditions). Common coringinduced deformation includes the concave-downward appearanc e of originally horizontal bedding. Piston action may result in fluidization (flow-in) at the bottom of APC cores. Retrieval from dept h to the surface can result in core expansion caused by the decrease i n pressure. Additionally, gas that was in solution at depth may exsolv e and cause significant sediment gaps or extrusion of the sediment. When gas content is high, pressure must be relieved for safety reasons before the cores are cut into segments. This is accomplished b y drilling holes into the liner, which forces some sediment as well a s gas out of the liner. Drilling disturbances are described in the Sedimentology section of each site chapter and are graphically indicate d on the visual core description summary reports.  

# Core handling and curatorial procedures  

Cores recovered during Expedition 361 were extracted from th e core barrel in plastic liners. These liners were carried from the ri g floor to the core processing area on the catwalk outside the Cor e Laboratory and cut into ${\sim}1.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ long sections. The exact sectio n length was noted and later entered into the database as “curate d length” using the Sample Master application. This number was use d to calculate recovery compared to core length from drilling. Headspace samples were taken from selected section ends (typically on e per core) using a syringe and immediately analyzed for hydrocarbo n content as part of the shipboard safety and pollution preventio n program. Whole-round samples for interstitial water were cut o n the catwalk. Core catcher samples were taken for biostratigraphi c analysis in the first hole and occasionally in subsequent holes if th e penetration was deeper than in previous holes or to refine a biostratigraphic datum. When catwalk sampling was complete, line r caps (blue $=$ top; colorless $=$ bottom; yellow $=$ bottom where wholeround cut was removed) were glued with acetone onto liner sections and the sections were placed in core racks in the laboratory fo r analysis.  

The numbering of sites, holes, cores, and samples followed standard IODP procedure. A full curatorial sample identifier consists o f the following information: expedition, site, hole, core number, cor e type, section number, and offset in centimeters measured from th e top of a given section. For example, a sample identification of $^{\ast}361\cdot$ - U1474A-1H-2W, $10{-}12\;\mathrm{cm}^{\flat}$ represents a sample taken from the interval between 10 and $12\;\mathrm{cm}$ below the top of Section 2 of Core  1 ( $^{a}\mathrm{H}^{n}$ designates that this core was taken with the APC system) o f Hole A at Site U1474 during Expedition 361. The “U” preceding th e hole number indicates that the hole was drilled by the JOIDES Resolution. Other core types are designated by ${}^{\epsilon}\mathrm{F}^{\upsilon}$ for cores taken wit h the HLAPC system and ${}^{\infty}\mathrm{X}^{\prime\prime}$ for cores taken by the XCB system. Th e letters “W” and $^{\ast}\mathrm{A}^{\,\ast}$ are used to denote the working half or the archive half of a split core section.  

# Shipboard core analysis  

Whole-round core sections were immediately passed throug h the Special Task Multisensor Logger (STMSL), also called the “fas t track,” or the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL). Th e STMSL measures density and magnetic susceptibility, and th e WRMSL measures $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity, density, and magnetic susceptibility. Whole-round core sections were also scanned with the Natural Gamma Radiation Logger (NGRL).  

In most cases, core sections were allowed to reach equilibriu m with laboratory temperature $(\sim\!4\;\mathrm{h})$ prior to being passed throug h the WRMSL and NGRL. However, there were some cases for whic h it was necessary to run the core sections through the NGRL prior t o thermal equilibrium to help guide stratigraphic correlation. Following the scanning of whole round sections, each section from a give n core was split lengthwise from bottom to top into working $(^{u}\mathrm{W}^{m})$ and archive (“A”) halves. Investigators should note that older material might have been transported upward on the split face of eac h section during splitting. The working half of each section was sampled for shipboard analysis (biostratigraphy, paleomagnetism, physical properties, geochemistry, and bulk X-ray diffraction [XRD ] mineralogy). The archive half of each section for each core wa s scanned on the Section Half Image Logger (SHIL) and measured fo r color reflectance and magnetic susceptibility on the Section Hal f Multisensor Logger (SHMSL). The archive halves were also described macroscopically and smear slides were used for microscopi c determination  of  composition. Following the sedimentologica l analysis, the archive halves were passed through the cryogeni c magnetometer. Both halves of the core were then put into labele d plastic tubes that were sealed and transferred to cold storage spac e aboard the ship.  

At the end of the expedition, all archive and working sectio n halves were transported from the ship to the Gulf Coast Repositor y in College Station, Texas (USA), for the postcruise sampling party. After the sampling party and XRF scanning, the cores were shippe d for permanent cold storage at the Kochi Core Center in Kochi, Japan.  

# Sample depth calculations  

The primary depth scale types are based on the measurement o f the drill string length deployed beneath the rig floor (drilling dept h below rig floor [DRF] and drilling depth below seafloor [DSF]) an d the length of each core recovered (core depth below seafloor [CSFA] and core composite depth below seafloor [CCSF]). All dept h scales are reported in meters. Depths of samples and measurement s are calculated at the applicable depth scale either by fixed protoco l (e.g., CSF-A) or by combinations of protocols with user-define d correlations (e.g., CCSF). The definition of these depth scale types, and the distinction in nomenclature, should keep the user awar e that a nominal depth value at two different depth scale types woul d not usually refer to exactly the same stratigraphic interval in a hole.  

Depths of cored intervals are measured from the drill floo r based on the length of drill pipe deployed beneath the rig floo r (DRF). The depth of the cored interval is referenced to the seafloo r (DSF) by subtracting the seafloor depth estimated at the first hol e from the DRF depth of the interval. In most cases, the seafloo r depth is the length of pipe deployed minus the length of the mudline core recovered.  

Standard depths of cores in meters below the seafloor (CSF- A scale) are determined based on the assumption that (1) the to p depth of a recovered core corresponds to the top depth of its core d interval (at DSF scale), and (2) the recovered material is a contiguous section even if core segments are separated by voids when recovered. Voids in the core are closed by pushing core segment s together, if possible, during core processing. This convention is als o applied if a core has incomplete recovery, in which case the true position of the core within the cored interval is unknown and shoul d be considered a sample depth uncertainty (with a magnitude a s much as the length of the core barrel used) for any core data analysis. Standard depths of subsamples and associated measurement s (CSF-A) are calculated by adding the offset of the subsample o r measurement from the top of its section, and the lengths of all higher sections in the core, to the top depth of the cored interval.  

A soft to semisoft sediment core from less than a few hundre d meters below seafloor expands upon recovery (typically a few percent to as much as $15\%$ ), so the length of the recovered core ma y exceed that of the cored interval. Therefore, a stratigraphic interval may not have the same nominal depth at the DSF and CSF-A scale s in the same hole. When core recovery (the ratio of recovered core t o cored interval times $100\%$ ) is ${>}100\%$ , the CSF-A depth of a sampl e taken from the bottom of a core will be deeper than that of a sampl e from the top of the subsequent core (i.e., the data associated wit h the two core intervals overlap at the CSF-A scale).  

Core composite depth scales (CCSF) are constructed for sites , whenever feasible, to mitigate the CSF-A core overlap problem a s well as the coring gap problem and to create as continuous a stratigraphic record as possible. Using shipboard track-based physical property data verified with core photos, core depths in adjacen t holes at a site are vertically shifted to correlate between cores recovered in adjacent holes. This process produces the CCSF-A dept h scale. The correlation process results in affine tables, indicating th e vertical shift of cores at the CCSF scale relative to the CSF-A scale. Once the CCSF scale is constructed, a splice can be defined tha t best represents the stratigraphy of a site by utilizing and splicing th e best portions of individual sections and cores from each hole at  a site. This process produces the CCSF-D depth scale, which i s strictly correct only along the splice. For detailed depth scale definitions, see Stratigraphic correlation.  

# Sedimentology  

The Expedition 361 sedimentary successions were divided int o lithostratigraphic units on the basis of digital color imaging, visual core descriptions (VCDs), smear slides, physical property data (se e Physical properties), shipboard measurements of total inorgani c and organic carbon content (see Geochemistry), and shipboar d XRD analyses.  

The methods were adapted from the reports of Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 339 (Expedition 339 Scientists, 2013), 342 (Norris et al., 2014), and IODP Expedition 353 (Clemens et al., 2016).  

# Preparation for core description  

The cores were split using the standard method of pulling a wir e lengthwise through their centers from bottom to top, which tend s to smear their cut surfaces and obscure fine details of lithology an d sedimentary structures. The archive core halves from Expeditio n 361 were gently scraped across, rather than along, the core sectio n using a stainless steel scraper to prepare the surface for digital imaging and sedimentological examination. Scraping parallel to beddin g with a freshly cleaned tool prevented cross-stratigraphic contamination.  

# Digital color image  

The archive half of each section for each core was scanned o n the SHIL. The SHIL imaged the flat face of the archive half of spli t cores using a line-scan camera. The archive halves were imaged a s soon as possible after splitting to capture the core surface prior t o drying and/or oxidation. Images were scanned at an interval of 1 0 lines $^\prime{\mathrm{mm}}$ , with camera height allowing for square pixels. The imaging light was provided by three pairs of advanced illumination highcurrent-focused LED line lights with fully adjustable angles of th e lens axis to illuminate large cracks and blocks in the core surfac e and sidewalls. Compression of line-scanned images on VCDs o r summary figures may result in visual artifacts, primarily laminatio n that is not present in the actual sections. Red, green, and blue (RGB ) data were also generated using the SHIL and used as a primary too l for stratigraphic correlation. Section-half depths were recorded together with the images and RGB data so that these images could b e used for core description and analysis.  

# Visual core description  

VCD sheets provide a summary of the data obtained durin g shipboard analysis of each sediment core including a simplifie d graphical representation of the core on a section-by-section basi s with accompanying descriptions of the features and lithologies observed (Figures F1, F2). We used the DESClogik application (version 13.2.0.0) to record and upload descriptive data into the IOD P Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) database (se e the DESClogik user guide at http://iodp.tamu.edu/labs/documentation). Spreadsheet templates were set up in DESClogik an d customized for Expedition 361 ahead of the first core arriving o n deck. A spreadsheet template with four tabs was customized, recording the following information:  

• Drilling disturbance   
• Sediment properties   
• Core summary (written description of major lithologic information by core), and   
• Unit summary  

Smear slides were used to quantify the texture and relativ e abundance of biogenic and nonbiogenic components (see Smea r slide descriptions). The locations of all smear slide samples take n from each core were recorded in the Sample Master application. DESClogik also includes a graphic display mode of digital images of section halves and physical property data to aid core description.

During Expedition 361, the Strater software package was used to compile the VCDs for each core. Site, hole, core number, and a core description summary are provided at the top of the VCD sheet (Figure F1). The written description for each core contains a concise summary of major and minor lithologies, sediment color based on the Munsell color classification, sedimentary structures, and drilling disturbances resulting from the coring process. Core depth (in meters), core length, section breaks, lithostratigraphic units, and age are indicated along the left side of the digital color image of the core and graphic lithology column. Columns to the right of the graphic lithology column include drilling disturbance (type and intensity), average grain size, sedimentary structures, lithologic accessories, bioturbation intensity, and shipboard sampling. Additional columns also show data collected by the WRMSL and SHMSL that include, from left to right, lightness $(\mathbf{L}^{*})$ and color $\mathbf{\vec{a}}^{\ast}$ and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ ) from color reflectance, magnetic susceptibility, and gamma ray attenuation (GRA) density. The graphic lithology column on the VCD sheet displays the dominant lithology of each section (Figure F1).  

# Sediment classification  

Naming conventions follow the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sediment classification scheme from Mazzullo et al. (1988) (Figure F3). For a mixture of components, minor components representing between $10\%$ and $25\%$ of the sediment follow the principal name in order of increasing abundance. The principal name is preceded by major modifiers (in order of increasing abundance) referring to components making up ${\ge}25\%$ of the sediment. For example, uncon

solidated sediment containing $50\%$ foraminifers, $30\%$ clay minerals, $10\%$ nannofossils, and $10\%$ diatoms would be described as a clayey foraminifer ooze with nannofossils and diatoms. The grain size scale used in descriptions is adapted from Wentworth (1922) (Figure F4).  

Description of lithification was based on the dominant composition (Figure F5):  

• Sediment composed predominantly of calcareous pelagic organisms (e.g., calcareous nannofossils and foraminifers): the lithification terms “ooze,” “chalk,” and “limestone” reflect whether the sediment can be deformed with a finger (ooze), can be scratched easily by a fingernail (chalk), or cannot be scratched with a fingernail (limestone).  

![](images/12e24ee88a3110b1db5e1559d81a8647205d536ea1a204f5c0e5e2430f488973.jpg)  

• Sediment composed predominantly of siliceous microfossils (diatoms, radiolarians, and siliceous sponge spicules): the lithification terms “ooze” and “radiolarite/spiculite/diatomite” reflect whether the sediment can be deformed with a finger (ooze) or cannot be easily deformed manually (radiolarite/spiculite/diatomite).  

• Sediment composed predominantly of siliciclastic material: if the sediment can be deformed easily with a finger, no lithification term is added and the sediment is named for the dominant grain size. For more consolidated material, the lithification suffix “-stone” is appended to the dominant size classification (e.g., “clay” versus “claystone”).  

• Consolidated sediment composed of an approximately equal mix of calcareous and fine siliciclastic material is described as “marlstone.”  

# Drilling-related sediment disturbance  

Because cores may be significantly disturbed and contain extraneous material because of the drilling and core handling proces s (Jutzeler et al., 2014), the uppermost $10{-}50\;\mathrm{cm}$ of each core was examined during core description for such potential disturbances. Common coring-induced deformations were identified, includin g the concave-downward appearance of originally horizontal beddin g as well as any fluidization (flow-in) at the bottom of APC cores resulting from the piston action. Because gas that is in solution a t depth may become free, if gas content was high, pressure was relieved for safety reasons before the core was cut into segments. Thi s was accomplished by drilling holes into the liner, which forces gas a s well as some sediment out of the liner.  

Drilling disturbances are described in the Sedimentology sections in each site chapter and are graphically indicated on th e graphic core summary report VCDs using symbols shown in Figur e F2. The style of drilling disturbance is described for soft and fir m sediment using the following terms:  

• Fall-in: out-of-place material at the top of a core has fallen downhole onto the cored surface.   
• Flow-in: soft-sediment stretching and/or compressional shearing structures are severe and are attributed to coring/drilling. The particular type of deformation may also be noted (e.g., gas expansion etc.).   
• Soupy or mousse-like: intervals are water saturated and have lost all aspects of original bedding.   
• Biscuit: sediments of intermediate stiffness show vertical variations in the degree of disturbance. Softer intervals are washed and/or soupy, whereas firmer, disk- or biscuit-shaped intervals are relatively undisturbed.   
• Cracked or fractured: firm sediments are broken but not displaced or rotated significantly.   
• Fragmented or brecciated: firm sediments are pervasively broken and may be displaced or rotated.  

# Stratification and sedimentary structures  

Sedimentary structures formed by physical and biological processes are represented with symbols in the sedimentary structure s column on the VCDs.  

Stratification  

Layers and bedding thickness were described and classified following terminology based on Mazzullo et al. (1988) and Sto w (2005):  

Thin lamination $=<0.3\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick Medium lamination $\mathit{\Pi}_{=}=0.3–0.6\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick Thick lamination $=0.6–1\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick Very thin bed $=1{-}3\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick Thin bed $=3–10\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick Medium be $\mathrm{d}=10{-}30\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick Thick bed $=30{-}100\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick Very thick bed $=>\!100\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick  

The different contacts observed are described as follows:  

• Gradational (normal/inverse): no horizontal line is drawn and there is a gradational curve between the two lithologies.   
• Bioturbated: no horizontal line is drawn. Occasionally, a burrow is drawn at the right of the average grain size curve to show if the contact is sharp and bioturbated.   
• Irregular: an irregular horizontal line is drawn between the two lithologies.   
• Sharp: a ruled straight line is drawn between the two lithologies and a dash is shown to the right of the curve.   
• Erosional/scoured: a wavy line is drawn between the two lithologies and a short wavy dash is shown to the right of the curve.  

# Bioturbation  

Bioturbation was characterized using a three-level scheme. Bioturbation intensity was classified as strong (3), moderate (2), sligh t (1), and absent (none). These intensities are illustrated with a numeric scale in the bioturbation column on the VCDs.  

# Lithologic accessories  

Lithologic, diagenetic, and paleontologic accessories, such a s nodules, sulfides, and shells, are indicated on the VCDs using symbols (Figure F2).  

# Smear slide descriptions  

Smear slide samples were taken from the archive halves durin g core description. For each sample, a small amount of sediment wa s removed with a wooden toothpick, dispersed evenly in deionize d water on a $25\:\mathrm{mm}\times75\:\mathrm{mm}$ glass slide, and dried on a hot plate at  a low setting. A drop of mounting medium was added and the slid e was covered by a $22{\mathrm{~mm}}\times30{\mathrm{~mm}}$ glass and placed in an ultraviole t light box for ${\sim}15\,\mathrm{\min}$ . Once fixed, each slide was investigated a t $100{-}200\times$ magnification with a transmitted light petrographic microscope using an eyepiece micrometer to assess grain size distributions in clay $(<\!4{\mathrm{~}}\upmu{\mathrm{m}})$ , silt $(4{-}63~\upmu\mathrm{m})$ , and sand $(>\!63\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ fractions. The eyepiece micrometer was calibrated once for each magnification and combination of ocular and objective, using an inscribe d stage micrometer. Relative proportions of each grain size and sediment components were estimated by microscopic examination. Note that smear slide analyses tend to underestimate the abundanc e of sand-sized and larger grains (e.g., foraminifers, radiolarians, an d siliciclastic sand) because these are difficult to incorporate into th e smear. Clay-sized biosilica, which is transparent and isotropic, i s also very difficult to quantify. Clay minerals, micrite, and nannofossils can also be difficult to distinguish at the very finest $(<\!4{\mathrm{~}}\upmu{\mathrm{m}})$ size range. After the general estimation of the grain-size distribution, several fields were examined at $200\!\times\!-\!500\!\times$ for mineral an d microfossil identification. Standard petrographic techniques wer e employed to identify the commonly occurring minerals and biogenic groups, as well as important accessory minerals and microfossils. Smear slide analysis data tables are included in Cor e descriptions. These tables include information about the sampl e location, description of where the smear slide was taken, the estimated percentages of texture (i.e., sand, silt, and clay), and the estimated percentages of composition (i.e., detrital carbonate, biogeni c carbonate, biogenic silica, and siliciclastics).  

# Shipboard samples  

Samples were taken for shipboard sedimentological and chemical analyses to aid core description and consisted of interstitial water  whole  rounds,  micropaleontology  samples,  smear  slides, samples for physical properties (moisture and density [MAD]) an d paleomagnetic studies, as well as selected samples for XRD and total inorganic carbon (TIC) and total organic carbon (TOC) analysis. Typically, three smear slides were made per core, but more sample s were selected where high variability or minor lithologies were present. Interstitial water samples were taken at designated intervals, and micropaleontology samples were obtained from the core catchers in the first hole as well as further samples to refine the stratigraphy within the cores and in additional holes to extend th e biostratigraphy or to address specific questions. Approximatel y three MAD samples were taken per core in the first hole. Discret e paleomagnetic samples were taken to verify the section-half paleomagnetic and susceptibility measurements and stratigraphy and t o investigate changing magnetic mineral compositions. Discrete soli d samples were taken for geochemical measurements (carbonate an d in some cases bulk geochemical analyses). In a few cases, XRD samples were taken from selected intervals to characterize lithologi c variability. TIC and organic carbon analyses were routinely take n from interstitial water squeeze cakes at the interval of one per cor e and at additional levels where requested (see Geochemistry). Al l shipboard samples are displayed in the VCDs.  

# X-ray diffraction  

Samples for XRD analyses were taken from the working-hal f sections, selected based on visual core observations (e.g., color variability and visual changes in lithology and texture) and smear slides. Samples analyzed for bulk mineralogy were freeze-dried an d ground by hand or in an agate ball mill, as necessary. Bulk sampl e XRD analyses were performed using a Bruker D-4 Endeavor X-ra y diffractometer with a Vantec detector using Ni-filtered $C\mathrm{uK}\alpha$ radiation $(40\,\mathrm{kV},40\,\mathrm{mA})$ ). Bulk powder samples were analyzed over a 2 θ range of $4^{\circ}{-}68^{\circ}$ with a step size of $0.01^{\circ}2\theta$ . Scan speed wa s $1.2^{\circ}2\theta/\mathrm{min}$ with a count time of $_{0.5\ s}$ . Samples analyzed for cla y mineralogy were first treated with $10\%$ acetic acid to remove carbonate minerals. The clay-sized fraction $\left(<2\,\upmu\mathrm{m}\right)$ was separated in  a $1\%$ sodium hexametaphosphate solution using a sonic dismembrator and centrifuge. The clay-sized suspension was allowed to dry o n a glass slide to create an oriented grain mount. An additional split o f the sample was treated with ethylene glycol. Oriented clay aggregates were analyzed over a 2θ range of $3^{\circ}{-}30^{\circ}$ . All XRD pattern s were analyzed using Bruker AXS DIFFRAC.EVA software (versio n 3.0). Shipboard results yielded only qualitative results on the presence and relative abundances of the most common mineralogical components. Digital files with the diffraction patterns are availabl e from the IODP LIMS database (http://iodp.tamu.edu/LORE/).  

# Physical properties  

Physical property measurements were made during Expeditio n 361 to provide information on the bulk physical character an d acoustic and elastic parameters of recovered sediment. Such dat a enhance our understanding of the physico-chemical context an d history for oceanic deposits, augment lithologic characterization, and facilitate correlation of downhole logging data with discret e core measurements and core descriptions. Physical property dat a can be measured quickly at a high resolution and, as such, serve a s important first-order proxies for determining changes in environmental conditions, geological processes, and/or depositional environments. Shipboard physical property data play a key role in th e following:  

• Hole-to-hole correlation for construction of composite stratigraphic sections;   
• Detection of discontinuities and inhomogeneities, either caused naturally or by the drilling process;   
• Identification of differences in the composition and texture of sediment;   
• Time-series analysis for detection of orbital cycles and tuning to reference cores for stratigraphic purposes;   
• Calculation of sedimentation and accumulation rates;   
• Core-log-seismic integration; and   
• Identification of major seismic reflectors and construction of synthetic seismic traces.  

Initial nondestructive measurements of physical propertie s were undertaken on three whole-round core logging systems; sections were run in the Special Task Multisensor Logger (STMSL) immediately following cutting on the catwalk, and then through th e WRMSL and Natural Gamma Ray Logger (NGRL) once core sections had warmed to ambient laboratory temperature (i.e., abov e $19^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$ ). The linear track of the STMSL houses a GRA bulk densitometer and a magnetic susceptibility sensor loop. The WRMSL employs a GRA bulk densitometer, magnetic susceptibility sensor loop, and compressional $P_{-}$ -wave velocity sensor. The NGRL records th e natural gamma radiation (NGR) emitted from the cores. Discret e samples were collected from the working halves, primarily from on e deep hole at each site, to measure wet bulk density, dry bulk density, water content, porosity, and grain density with moisture and densit y (MAD) procedures. Further holes were only occasionally sample d for MAD measurements to fill gaps in the sample series. To save a s much material as possible for shore-based sampling, destructiv e shear strength measurements on split cores were not made durin g Expedition 361. For the same reason, compressional $P$ -wave velocit y measurements on split cores were only occasionally performed b y using the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis caliper-type contact probe. Archive halves wer e measured with the SHMSL for color reflectance (with an Ocea n Optics sensor) and magnetic susceptibility using a discrete pointsource Bartington probe. A full discussion of all methodologies an d calculations used aboard the JOIDES Resolution in the Physica l Properties Laboratory is available in Blum (1997).  

# Whole-round core logging operation and sensors Special Task Multisensor Logger  

The purpose of STMSL logging operations during Expeditio n 361 was to rapidly record medium- to high-resolution GRA densit y and magnetic susceptibility data. This information is needed a t multihole sites to ensure that drilling depth offsets are set at different stratigraphic depths in each hole so that a complete composit e stratigraphic section can be constructed. The GRA bulk densitometer and magnetic susceptibility loop incorporated in the STMS L are effectively identical to those in the WRMSL (see below). Th e spacing distance between STMSL measurements was typically 2. 5 cm for GRA density and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Scanning time averaged 8 s per sample with three repeats for th e magnetic susceptibility measurements. A core can therefore b e passed through the STMSL in ${\sim}25\,\mathrm{min}$ . Comments about structura l integrity and incomplete filling of liners were recorded.  

# Whole-Round Multisensor Logger  

High-resolution WRMSL data, especially GRA bulk density an d magnetic susceptibility, were gathered to advance shipboard coreto-core correlation between drill holes and the construction of composite stratigraphic sections. WRMSL data assembly had to b e completed within a reasonable time to not encumber downstrea m core processing and sample collection. The quality of WRMSL dat a is highly dependent on the structural integrity of the sedimen t (cracks, voids, biscuiting, etc.) and whether any gaps between th e sediment and the core liner are present. GRA bulk density and magnetic susceptibility were measured nondestructively on all wholeround core sections. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity was measured in sections undisturbed by gas expansion voids and cracks. To optimize WRMS L performance, the same sampling spacing was set for all sensors. Measurement time, although somewhat different for the differen t sensors, averaged ${\sim}8$ s per data, with three repeats of the magneti c susceptibility measurements providing sufficient reproducibility. With handling and data initialization, a $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ section took ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{min}$ to scan.  

# GRA bulk density  

Bulk density varies with water-saturated porosity, grain densit y (dominant mineralogy), grain packing, and coring disturbance. T o measure bulk density, the GRA densitometer uses a $10\ \mathrm{mCi}\ ^{137}\mathrm{Cs}$ capsule as a gamma ray source (with the principal energy peak a t $0.662\,\mathrm{MeV})$ and a scintillation detector. The narrow collimated pea k is attenuated as it passes through the center of the core. Inciden t photons are scattered by the electrons of the sediment by Compto n scattering.  

The attenuation of the incident intensity $\left(I_{0}\right)$ is directly related t o the electron density in the sediment core of diameter $D$ that can b e related to bulk density given the average attenuation coefficient (i n micrometers) of the sediment (Evans, 1965; Harms and Choquette, 1965). Because the attenuation coefficient is similar for most common minerals and aluminum, bulk density is obtained through direct calibration of the densitometer using aluminum rods o f different diameters mounted in a core liner filled with distilled water. The GRA densitometer has a spatial resolution of $<\!1\;\mathrm{cm}$ .  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

Magnetic susceptibility is a measure of the degree to which  a material can be magnetized by an external magnetic field, providin g information on the magnetic composition of the sediment tha t commonly can be related to mineralogical composition (e.g., terrigenous versus biogenic materials) and diagenetic overprinting. Magnetite and a few other iron oxides with ferromagnetic characteristics have a specific magnetic susceptibility several orders o f magnitude higher than clay, which has paramagnetic properties. Carbonate layers, opal, water, and plastic (core liner) have small negative values of magnetic susceptibility. Calcareous and biogeni c deposits with low clay and iron-bearing mineral debris content thu s have values approaching the detection limit of magnetic susceptibility meters.  

Magnetic susceptibility was measured on the WRMSL an d STMSL with the Bartington Instruments MS2C system. The frequency at which the magnetic susceptibility loop operates is $565\;\mathrm{Hz}$ for the WRMSL and STMSL (Blum, 1997). We used a 1 s measurement cycle with three measurements averaged at each sample position. The unit switch on the instrument was set to SI units. In thi s report we present the raw output of the magnetic susceptibility sensors as instrument units (IU). To obtain dimensionless SI volumespecific magnetic susceptibility values, these instrument units, which are also stored in the IODP database, must be multiplied by  a correction factor (0.68) to compensate for instrument scaling an d the geometric ratio between core and loop dimensions.  

# Compressional P-wave velocity  

$P$ -wave velocity varies with the material’s lithology, porosity, an d bulk density, as well as state of stress, temperature, and fabric or degree of fracturing. In sediment and rock, velocity is controlled b y the degree of consolidation and lithification and fracturing, alon g with the occurrence and abundance of free gas and gas hydrate. Together with bulk density, velocity data are used to calculate acousti c impedance and reflection coefficients in order to construct synthetic seismic profiles and to estimate the depth of specific seismi c horizons.  

The $P.$ -wave velocity sensor measures the ultrasonic $P$ -wave velocity of the whole-round sample residing in the core liner. The $P$ - wave logger transmits a $500\ \mathrm{kHz}$ $P$ -wave pulse across the core section at a specified repetition rate. Traveltime is determined by signal processing software that uses a series of mathematical and data manipulation techniques to suppress the noise relative to the peak o f the first arrival and automatically detects the first arrival of the $P_{-}$ - wave signal to a precision of $50\,\mathrm{ns}$ . Prior to coring at Site U1476, th e algorithm for detecting the first arrival of the $P$ -wave signal on th e WRMSL was changed such that the signal-to-noise ratio enhancement process consisted of three steps: (1) smoothing, (2) first derivative, and 3) smoothing (see EXP 361 TECH RPT P-Wave.docx i n PWVTECH in Supplementary material). With the new approach, the number of outliers in the $P$ -wave data set was significantly reduced compared to the previous sites. Ultrasonic $P.$ -wave velocity i s calculated after correcting for system propagation delay, liner thickness, and liner material velocity.  

# NGR core logging  

The NGRL was designed and built at the Texas A&M Universit y IODP facility and measures gamma radiation emitted from wholeround core sections (Vasiliev et al., 2011). Gamma radiation detected by the logger arises primarily from the decay of mineralhosted uranium, thorium, and potassium isotopes. In general, hig h counts identify fine-grained deposits containing K-rich clay minerals and their absorbed U and Th atoms. The NGR data reveal s stratigraphic details that aid in core-to-core correlations.  

The main NGR detector unit consists of 8 sodium iodide (NaI ) scintillator detectors surrounding the lower half of the section,  7 shielding plastic scintillator detectors, 22 photomultipliers, and passive lead shielding. The NaI detectors are covered by at least $8\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ o f lead shielding. In addition, lead separators $\mathbf{\zeta}^{\sim}\sim\mathbf{7}\mathbf{\zeta}\mathbf{cm}$ of low-background lead) are positioned between the NaI detectors. Half of th e lead shielding closest to the NaI detectors is composed of low-background lead, whereas the outer half is composed of common (virgin) lead. In addition to this passive lead shielding, the overlyin g plastic scintillators detect incoming high-energy gamma and muo n cosmic radiation and cancel this signal from the total counted by th e NaI detectors.  

A measurement run consisted of two core section positions. Gamma rays were counted for $5\;\mathrm{min}$ at each position. At position  1 the gamma ray signal was collected at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, an d $140~\mathrm{{cm}}$ from the core-section top, and at position 2 the signal wa s collected at 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, 130, and $150~\mathrm{cm}$ from the coresection top, resulting in a total of 16 measurements ( $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ spacing ) per section. Further information may be found in Vasiliev et al. (2011) and Dunlea et al. (2013).  

# Thermal conductivity  

After NGR measurements were completed, thermal conductivity was measured with the TK04 (Teka Bolin) system using the needle-probe method in full-space configuration for whole-roun d sediment cores (Von Herzen and Maxwell, 1959). The needle prob e contains a heater wire and calibrated thermistor. The probe was inserted into a $2~\mathrm{mm}$ hole drilled through the liner along one of th e lines that later guided the splitting of the core. To avoid interferenc e from airflow in the laboratory, an insulating jacket of foam rubbe r was placed over the core section during measurement of therma l conductivity. Because the probe is much more conductive than unconsolidated sediment, the probe is assumed to be a perfect conductor.  Under  this  assumption,  the  temperature  of  th e superconductive probe has a linear relationship with the natura l logarithm of the time after the initiation of the heat:  

$$
T\left(t\right)=\left(q/4\uppi k\right)\times\ln(t)+{\sf C},
$$  

where  

$T\!=$ temperature (K),   
$q=$ heat input per unit length per unit time $\left(\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}\right)$ , $k=$ thermal conductivity $(\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}])$ ,   
$t=$ time after the initiation of the heat (s), and   
$C=$ instrumental constant.  

Three measuring cycles were automatically performed at eac h probe location to calculate average conductivity. A self-test, whic h included a drift study, was conducted at the beginning of each measurement cycle. Once the probe temperature stabilized, the heate r circuit was closed and the temperature rise in the probe was recorded. Thermal conductivity was calculated from the rate of temperature rise while the heater current was flowing. Temperature s measured during the first 150 s of the heating cycle were fitted to a n approximate solution of a constantly heated line source (for details, see Kristiansen, 1982; Blum, 1997). Measurement errors were $5\%-$ $10\%$ . Thermal conductivity measurements were routinely taken at  a resolution of $10{-}20\;\mathrm{m}$ in one deep hole of each site.  

# Moisture and density  

After completion of whole-round measurements, whole-roun d cores were split into working halves and archive halves. The working halves were placed on the sampling table for the collection o f discrete samples to determine wet and dry bulk density, grain density, water content, salt content, and porosity. In soft sediment, ${\sim}12$ $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ samples were collected with a $2~\mathrm{{cm}}$ diameter plastic syring e that fits into a glass vial of $10~{\mathsf{c m}}^{3}$ volume so that the vial is completely filled with sediment. Samples were collected from ever y other section.  

Samples were placed in prelabeled and preweighed $16~\mathrm{~mL}$ Wheaton glass vials for wet and dry sediment mass measurement. The samples were dried in a convective oven at $105^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ and allowed to cool in a desiccator for ${\sim}3\mathrm{~h~}$ before taking the dr y volume measurements. The weights of wet and dry sample masse s were determined to a precision of $0.005\:\mathrm{g}$ using two Mettler Toled o electronic balances and a computer averaging system to compensate for the ship’s motion. Dry sample volume was determined usin g a hexapycnometer system of a six-celled, custom-configured Micromeritics AccuPyc 1330TC helium-displacement pycnometer. The precision of each cell is $1\%$ of the full-scale volume. Volum e measurement was preceded by three purges of the sample chambe r with helium warmed to ${\sim}28^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Three measurement cycles were ru n for each sample. A reference volume (calibration sphere) was place d sequentially in one of the chambers to check for instrument drif t and systematic error. The volume of glass for each numbere d Wheaton vial was calculated before the cruise by dividing th e weight of each vial by the average density of the vial glass. Dry mas s and volume were measured after samples were heated in an oven a t $105^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ and allowed to cool in a desiccator. The procedures for the determination of these physical properties compl y with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) designation (D) 2216 (ASTM International, 1990). The fundamental relation and assumptions for the calculations of all physical propert y parameters are discussed by Blum (1997) and summarized below.  

# Mass and volume calculation  

Wet mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)_{\mathrm{.}}$ , dry mass $(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , and dry volume $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ wer e measured in the laboratory. The ratio of mass $(\mathrm{rm})$ is a computational constant of 0.965 (i.e., $0.965\mathrm{~g~}$ of freshwater per $_{\mathrm{~1~g~}}$ of seawater). Salt precipitated in sediment pores during the dryin g process is included in the $M_{\mathrm{dry}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{dry}}$ values. The mass of th e evaporated water $\left(M_{\mathrm{water}}\right)$ and salt $\left(M_{\mathrm{salt}}\right)$ in the sample are given by, respectively,  

$$
M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{water}}[{\bf s}/(1-{\bf s})],
$$  

where s is the assumed saltwater salinity $(0.035\%)$ corresponding t o a pore water density $\l(\rho_{\mathrm{pw}})$ of $1.024\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and a salt density $(\boldsymbol\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}})$ o f $2.22\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The corrected mass of pore water $(M_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , volume of por e water $(V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , mass of solids excluding salt $(M_{\mathrm{solid}})$ , volume of sal t $(V_{\mathrm{salt}})$ , volume of solids excluding salt $\mathrm{~\bigcup_{solid}^{\prime}})$ , and wet volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ are  

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{M_{\mathrm{pw}}=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})/\mathrm{rm},}&{{}}&{}\\ {V_{\mathrm{pw}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}},}&{{}}&{}\end{array}
$$  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{M_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{pw}},\phantom{M_{\mathrm{solid}}}}\\ {M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}-(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}),}\\ {V_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{salt}}/\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}},}\end{array}
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{solid}}=V_{\mathrm{wet}}-V_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

# Calculation of bulk properties  

For all sediment samples, water content $\left(w\right)$ is expressed as th e ratio of mass of pore water to wet sediment (total) mass,  

$$
w=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/M_{\mathrm{wet}}.
$$  

Wet bulk density $\scriptstyle\left(\uprho_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , dry bulk density $\mathbf{\rho}(\uprho_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , sediment grai n density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , porosity ${\bf\Pi}(\Phi)$ , and void ratio $(V R)$ are calculated as  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{wet}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}}}\\ &{\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{dry}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}}}\\ &{}\\ &{\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}}\ltimes}\\ &{\Phi=V_{\mathrm{pw}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}}\mathrm{~and~}}\\ &{V R=V_{\mathrm{pw}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}}.}\end{array}
$$  

Moisture and density properties reported and plotted in th e Physical properties sections of all site chapters were calculated wit h the MADMax shipboard program.  

# Discrete velocity measurements  

Because of the generally quite good quality of the $P$ -wave logging data from the WRMSL during the expedition, $P$ -wave velocit y measurements on split cores were performed only occasionally b y using the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis caliper-type contact probe transducers on the Section Half Measurement Gantry. The system uses Panametrics-ND T Microscan delay line transducers, which transmit at $0.5\;\mathrm{MHz}$ . Th e signal, received through the sample, was recorded by the syste m computer and the peak ( $P$ -wave arrival) was chosen by an autopicking software. In case of a weak signal, the first arrival was manuall y picked. The distance between transducers was measured with  a built-in linear voltage displacement transformer (LDVT).  

Calibration was performed with a series of acrylic cylinders o f differing thicknesses and a known $P$ -wave velocity of $2750\pm20\,\mathrm{m/s}$ . The determined system time delay from calibration was subtracte d from the picked arrival time to give a travel time of the $P$ -wav e through the sample. The thickness of the sample (calculated by th e LDVT in meters) was divided by the travel time (in seconds) to calculate $P$ -wave velocity in meters per second.  

# Digital color image  

The surfaces of the archive halves of split cores were digitall y imaged using a 3-CCD (charge-coupled device) line-scan camer a (JAI model CV107CL) with a macro lens (AF micro Nikkor $60\;\mathrm{mm}$ , 1:2.8). Mounted on the SHIL, the camera moves across the sampl e on a motorized gantry. Prior to imaging, and when necessary, th e core face was prepared by scraping across, rather than along, th e core section using a stainless steel or glass scraper. Scraping parallel to bedding with a freshly cleaned tool prevented cross-stratigraphi c contamination. After splitting, the archive halves were imaged a s soon as possible to capture the core surface prior to drying and/o r oxidation. Images were scanned at an interval of 10 lines/mm, wit h camera height allowing for square pixels. The imaging light wa s provided by three pairs of advanced illumination high-current focused LED line lights with fully adjustable angles to the lens axis. Compression of line-scanned images on VCDs or summary figure s may result in visual artifacts, primarily lamination that is not present in the actual sections. Along with the images the variations i n the RGB color channels were also recorded by the SHIL and used a s a primary tool for stratigraphic correlation.  

# Spectrophotometry and magnetic susceptibility point measurements  

After imaging, spectrophotometry was measured on the archiv e halves with the SHMSL. Spurious measurements may occur fro m small cracks, drilling disturbance, plastic section dividers, or i n cases where the instrument could not land the sensors flatly on th e core surface, resulting in the leakage of ambient room light into th e spectrophotometer readings.  

Reflectance of visible light from the archive halves of sedimen t cores was measured using an Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrophotometer mounted on the automated SHMSL. A halogen light source, covering a wavelength range through the visible spectrum an d slightly into the infrared domain, was used. Prior to Expedition 361, an additional blue light source was installed to enhance performance at the darker end of the spectrum. Freshly split cores wer e covered with clear plastic wrap and placed on the SHMSL. Measurements were taken at different spacing $(0.5{-}8~\mathrm{cm},$ depending o n need based on accumulation rate and available time) to provid e high-resolution stratigraphic records of color variation for visibl e wavelengths. Each measurement was recorded in $2~\mathrm{nm}$ wide spectral bands from 400 to $900\ \mathrm{nm}$ . Additional details regarding measurement and interpretation of spectral data can be found in Balsa m et al. (1997), Balsam and Damuth (2000), and Giosan et al. (2001, 2002).  

Magnetic susceptibility was measured with a Bartington Instruments MS2E point sensor (high-resolution surface-scanning sensor) on discrete points along the SHMSL track. Measurements ( 3 repeats) were taken at the same spacing as the reflectance measurements, integrating a volume of $10.5\ \mathrm{mm}\times\ 3.8\ \mathrm{mm}\times\ 4\ \mathrm{mm},$ , wher e $10.5\;\mathrm{mm}$ is the length perpendicular to the core axis, $3.8~\mathrm{mm}$ is th e width in the core axis, and $4\;\mathrm{mm}$ is the depth. For conversion of th e instrument units stored in the IODP database, a correction facto r (67/80) must be employed to correct for the relation of the senso r diameter and sediment thickness.  

# Micropaleontology  

Paleontological studies were primarily based on semiquantitative analyses of calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminife r assemblages as well as benthic foraminifers, diatoms, radiolarians, and phytoliths. Preliminary ages were assigned based on cor e catcher samples for each site. Additional samples taken within th e cores were examined when a more refined age determination wa s required. Calcareous nannofossil and foraminifer age events fro m the late Miocene to the recent were evaluated by correlation to th e geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS) of Gradstein et al. (2012). The microfossils zonal scheme used during Expedition 361 is illustrated in Figure F6.  

# Calcareous nannofossils  

# Zonal scheme and taxonomy  

The nannofossil biostratigraphic zonation schemes of Martin i (1971; codes NN) and Okada and Bukry (1980; codes CN) were adopted for this study. Age dates were calibrated following Lourens e t al. (2004) and Gradstein et al. (2012) (Table T1). Biostratigraphi c events were determined based on the occurrence of calcareou s nannofossils (abundance, presence, or absence) in core catcher samples, in preselected intervals, and in additional split-core sections, when necessary. The taxonomy and identification mainly followe d Perch-Nielsen (1985) and Bown (1998). Young et al. (2003) was adopted for the recent taxa.  

# Methods of study  

Core samples for determining nannofossil assemblages and relative preservation were studied using the standard smear slide technique (Watkins and Bergen, 2003) and mounted with Norlan d Optical adhesive 61 (refractive index $=1.56)$ ). Calcareous nannofossil recognition was achieved with a Zeiss Axiophot light microscope  under  cross-polarized  transmitted  light  and  brightfiel d illumination at $1000\times$ magnification. Selected samples were additionally analyzed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Hitachi tabletop microscope TM3000). Additionally, mudline sample s from the water/seafloor interface were analyzed to assess preservation and biodiversity of recently deposited fossils. The mudline suspension was collected in a bucket from which subsamples wer e withdrawn by centrifuging the solution. Smear slides and stubs wer e then prepared for SEM analyses. Photographs were taken using th e Spot FLEX system with Image Capture and Spot software as well a s with the SEM.  

Total abundance of calcareous nannofossils within the sedimen t record was categorized as  

$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $750\%$ of sediment particles).   
$C={\mathsf{c o m m o n}}$ $\langle>\!10\%{-}50\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few $\!\!\:(1\%\!-\!10\%)$ of sediment particles).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $[\!\!\le\!1\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (none present).  

Abundances of individual calcareous nannofossil taxa were categorized as  

$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant ( $_{>10}$ specimens per field of view [FOV]).   
$C=$ common $_{>1-10}$ specimens per FOV).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few (1 specimen per $1{-}10\,\mathrm{FOV})$ ).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $_{<1}$ specimen per 10 FOV).  

Preservation of calcareous nannofossils, based on dissolutio n and overgrowth was classified as  

$\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (little or no evidence of dissolution and/or overgrowth; primary morphological characteristics appear unaltered; specimens identifiable to the species level).   
$\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (minor to moderate dissolution and/or overgrowth; primary morphological characteristics somewhat modified; most specimens identifiable to the species level).   
$\mathbf{P}=$ poor (severe dissolution, fragmentation and/or overgrowth; primary morphological characteristics and specimens mostly unidentifiable).

# Planktonic and benthic foraminifers  

# Zonal scheme and taxonomy  

For the Pliocene–Pleistocene, the biostratigraphy of Wade et al. (2011) was updated with specific age assignments for Indian Ocea n sites based on the review of Vincent (1977). Age estimates for planktonic foraminifer datums follow Gradstein et al. (2012) (Table T2). Planktonic foraminifer taxonomic concepts in the Cenozoic selectively follow those of Jenkins (1971), Blow (1979), Kennett and Srinivasan (1983), Bolli et al. (1985), Toumarkine and Luterbache r (1985), Scott et al. (1990), Pearson (1995), Chaisson and Pearso n (1997), and Olsson et al. (1999). A taxonomic list of planktonic foraminifer datum species is given in Table T3.  

Benthic foraminifer taxonomy systematics for generic assignment follow Loeblich and Tappan (1988). Species identification wa s conducted following Holbourn et al. (2013) and Jones (1994). Ecological and paleobathymetric interpretations are based on a compilation  of  ecological  data,  including  but  not  limited  to  va n Morkhoven et al. (1986). Benthic foraminifers provide only limite d biostratigraphic  age  control,  but  they  are  useful  for  paleobathymetric and paleoenvironmental interpretation.  

# Methods of study  

Roughly $20{-}30~\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment from the core catcher wa s washed to identify the main planktonic and benthic foraminifer datum events. At some sites we examined samples at a resolution of  1 per section in certain holes to refine preliminary biozones. Sediment was washed with tap water over a $63~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ mesh sieve. Whe n time allowed, samples were dried in an oven and soaked in tap wate r and borax before washing. To avoid contamination of foraminifer s between samples, the empty sieves were placed in an ultrasoni c bath for several minutes and cleaned with compressed air. Washe d residues were dried on $63\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ screens in a $90^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ oven and transferre d to sample vials. A subsample was examined under a binocular Zeis s Discovery V8 stereomicroscope.  

Examination of planktonic foraminifers was carried out on th e ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction, and examination of benthic foraminifers wa s conducted on the ${>}63\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction. The split sample was spread ove r a sample tray and examined for either planktonic or benthic foraminifers. Where possible, at least 150 specimens were picked, identified, and counted to determine the relative abundances of benthi c foraminifers.  

Photomicrographs were taken using a Spot RTS system wit h IODP Image Capture and commercial Spot software. We also used  a Hitachi TM3000 tabletop SEM to create images for verification o f our species assignments and to make photographic plates. Th e dried foraminifer residues were used to estimate the abundance o f total planktonic and benthic foraminifers relative to other sedimentary components, as follows:  

$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $750\%$ of the total sediment particles).   
$C=$ common $>\!25\%{-}50\%$ of the total sediment particles). $\mathrm{F}=$ few $5\%-25\%$ of the total sediment particles).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $-5\%$ of the total particles).   
$\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (no specimens in the whole sample).

# Siliceous microfossils  

# Zonal scheme and taxonomy  

The diatom zonal scheme used for the Indian Ocean mainly follows biostratigraphic studies by Barron (1985), Mikkelsen (1990), and Fourtanier (1991). Datums were modified following the updated GPTS (Gradstein et al., 2012). The biozones used for the Neogene are those described by Barron (1985) for the Pacific Ocean; however, some biozone boundaries were modified following bioevent ages calibrated for the Indian Ocean (Fourtanier, 1991; Mikkelsen, 1990) (Table T4).  

In the mid- to low-latitude Indian Ocean sites, we follow th e tropical Pacific radiolarian zones (Sanfilippo and Nigrini, 1998; Nigrini and Sanfilippo, 2001; Kamikuri et al., 2009) (Table T5; Figur e F6).  

For the Southern Ocean assemblages, the initial shipboard ag e assignment of individual samples for $0{-}18\ \mathrm{Ma}$ is mostly based o n diatoms  using  the  high-resolution  quantitative  diatom  biochronology of Cody et al. (2008). Species ranges and age assignments are in Table T6. We primarily employed the constraine d optimization (CONOP) average range model, drawing on the information from the CONOP total range model, where appropriate. The taxonomic concepts of marker species are comprehensivel y specified in appendixes 1a and 1b of Cody et al. (2008).  

# Methods of study  

Diatoms, radiolarians, silicoflagellates, ebridians, sponge spicules, and phytolith assemblages were analyzed from smear slide s mounted with Norland optical adhesive 61 (refractive index $=1.56)$ . Samples with rare to common overall abundance of siliceous microfossils were either disaggregated in distilled water or processed wit h hydrogen peroxide $(\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2})$ and/or $10\%$ hydrochloric acid (HCl). Strewn slides were prepared from these samples, and, when necessary, the cleaned material was washed over a $20\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ sieve to improv e viewing. Species identification was carried out with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope using brightfield illumination at $400\times$ , $630\times$ (oil), and $1000\times$ (oil) magnification. The counting method of Schrade r and Gersonde (1978) was utilized for all diatom specimens.  

Abundances of individual taxa were quantified by a count tallie d over two $22\,\mathrm{mm}$ traverses of a smear slide using $630\times$ magnification. Photomicrographs were taken using a Spot FLEX system with IOD P Image Capture and commercial Spot software. We also used a Hitachi TM3000 tabletop SEM. Qualitative siliceous microfossil grou p abundances were also determined from smear slides, using $630\times$ magnification.  

Abundance of groups and individual taxa are categorized as  

$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant ( $_{>10}$ valves per FOV).   
$C=$ common $_{\leftmoon1-10}$ valves per FOV).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few ( $\sp{\sp{\prime}}{\bf\Sigma}^{21}$ valve every 10 FOV and $^{<1}$ valve per FOV).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $^{\leftmoon}_{\leftmoon}3$ valves per traverse and $_{<1}$ valve per 10 FOV).   
${\boldsymbol{\mathrm{X}}}=$ trace ( $_{<3}$ valves per traverse, including fragments).   
$\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (no valves or fragments observed).   
$?=$ uncertain identification.  

Preservation of individual siliceous microfossil groups was determined qualitatively using the following scale (Barron and Gladenkov, 1995):  

$\mathsf{V G}=$ very good (no breakage or dissolution). $\mathbf{G}=$ good (majority of specimens complete, with minor dissolution and/or breakage and no significant enlargement of the

# Paleomagnetism  

The main aim for shipboard magnetic measurements was  identification of past reversals of the Earth’s magnetic field in order t o establish the magnetostratigraphy for sediment cores recovere d during Expedition 361. High-resolution, continuous paleomagneti c measurements were performed on archive halves using a superconducting  rock  magnetometer  (SRM).  Additionally,  detaile d paleo- and rock magnetic experiments were carried out on discret e samples to support the continuous SRM data and further characterize the magnetic inventory of the sediment.  

# Continuous measurements  

Archive halves were analyzed using a 2G Enterprises Model760R SRM equipped with three direct-current super conductin g quantum interference devices (DC-SQUID) and an in-line alternating field (AF) demagnetizer equipped with two transverse and on e axial AF degausser. Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) measurements were performed at $4\ \mathrm{cm}$ resolution, the first and las t measurements taken $15\;\mathrm{cm}$ from the ends of the core sections. Subsequently, the core halves were AF demagnetized, and at the sam e intervals remanence measurements were taken after each demagnetization step. Past experiences of technical staff and scientists onboard the JOIDES Resolution have shown that at AF levels highe r than $40~\mathrm{mT},$ a leaking field into the AF unit causes samples to acquire an anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM). To avoid thi s issue and to preserve core NRM for possible future demagnetization experiments, we used maximum AF fields of 15, 20, or $25~\mathrm{mT}$ which depended on the coercivity of the magnetic minerals presen t at each site.

# Discrete samples  

Discrete samples were taken from each or every other workinghalf section using $2.3\;\mathrm{cm}\times2.2\;\mathrm{cm}\times2.2\;\mathrm{cm}\:(7\:\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ “Japanese” sampling cubes with rounded corners. All samples were taken in th e middle of sections where the influence of drilling disturbance wa s expected to be small. The magnetic susceptibility of each sampl e was measured by using a KYL-4S Kappabridge. On selected sample s measurements of anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) wer e conducted using the automated sample rotation of the KYL-4S. During the rotation along each of the three specimen axes, repetitive measurements were performed to allow identification of th e anisotropy ellipsoid characterized by three susceptibility tensors, each normal to the others: $K_{\mathrm{max}},K_{\mathrm{int}},$ and $K_{\mathrm{min}}$ . The data are represented by an equal-angle, lower hemisphere projection of the large r principal axis $\left(K_{\operatorname*{max}}\right)$ of the AMS tensor. On this lower hemisphere, each point is determined by the intersection of an axis passing b y the center of the hemisphere and reflecting the alignment of para - and ferrimagnetic minerals (magnetic or sediment fabric). As th e AMS fabric in marine sediment is acquired during deposition (i.e., the statistical common organization of the grains providing that th e grains have an oblong shape), it may be indicative of bottom-current strengths (e.g., Ellwood and Ledbetter, 1977, 1979; Joseph et al., 1998; Hassold et al., 2006). Following the susceptibility measurements, all discrete samples were demagnetized in up to 7 steps between 5 and $100~\mathrm{mT}$ using a manually operated AF demagnetize r (Model 2G600). The aim was to verify (1) if a stable characteristi c remanent  magnetization  (ChRM)  can  be  determined  an d (2) whether a potential coring or early diagenetic overprint biasin g the primary directional record was sufficiently removed by the demagnetization level chosen for SRM measurements. Afterward, experiments of isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) acquisitio n were performed at 100, 1200, and a backfield of $300~\mathrm{mT}$ using a n ASC IM10 impulse magnetizer. IRM acquisition remanence measurements are indicative of the magnetic mineralogy, which depends on the detrital magnetic mineral supply and/or diageneti c dissolution and neo-formation of ferrimagnetic minerals.  

Based on these remanence parameters the saturation IR M (SIRM) was approximated by  

$$
\mathrm{SIRM}=\mathrm{IRM}\,1200\,\mathrm{mT},
$$  

the hard IRM (HIRM) was approximated by  

$$
\mathrm{HIRM}=0.5\times\mathrm{(SIRM-IRM-300\,mT)},
$$  

and the $S_{}$ -ratio was calculated by  

$$
S=0.5\times\left(1+\mathrm{IRM}-300\;\mathrm{mT/SIRM}\right).
$$  

For both the NRM and IRM experiments, magnetic intensitie s were measured using a JR-6A spinner magnetometer.  

# Magnetostratigraphy  

Based on directional changes of inclination and declination, magnetic polarity zones were defined for sediment sequences recovered during Expedition 361. Core orientation data were collected with the Icefield MI-5 and FlexIt core orientation tools for  5 min prior to the firing of each APC core. Where available, orientation data were used to correct the declination of each core. Norma l and reversed polarity zones were assigned to the paleomagneti c (sub-)chrons reported by Gradstein et al. (2012) (Figure F6).  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

As with any IODP paleoceanographic expedition, the scientifi c objectives of Expedition 361 demanded recovery of complete stratigraphic sections with continuity on the centimeter scale. Such recovery is impossible to achieve with a single IODP hole becaus e coring gaps generally occur between successive cores during th e APC process, despite $100\%$ or greater recovery (e.g., Ruddiman, Kidd, Thomas, et al., 1987; Hagelberg et al., 1995; Acton et al., 2001). Furthermore, the top of any core might sample sediment tha t has fallen into the hole, resulting in stratigraphic noise. Thus, th e reconstruction of a complete, continuous, and “representative ” stratigraphic section requires combining stratigraphic interval s from two or more holes cored at the same site, where the depths o f core gaps are staggered between holes. Given this primary objective, the shipboard work of the stratigraphic correlators during Expedition 361 was threefold: (1) to use the correlation of sedimen t physical properties among holes (that have been scanned rapidl y upon retrieval of cores) as a guide while drilling to minimize ga p alignment, (2) to construct a composite depth scale for all hole s drilled, and (3) to reconstruct the most representative single continuous sedimentary section by splicing intervals from multiple holes.  

The procedure for each of these activities involves consideratio n of several different depth scales (Figure F7). The depth scales use d during Expedition 361 followed IODP conventions (see IOD P Depth Scales Terminology at http://www.iodp.org/policies-andguidelines) and are described in methodological order.  

# Core depth below seafloor (CSF-A) scale  

The starting point for the process of building a composite section is to assign a depth to the top of each core, and this is base d initially on the drilling depth below seafloor (DSF). DSF is a drill string measurement determined as the difference between (1) th e length of the drill string below the rig floor to the top of the core d interval and (2) the length of the drill string from the rig floor to th e mudline (assumed to be the seafloor). DSF error includes phenomena such as pipe and BHA stretch and compression, tides, and uncompensated heave. Tidal influence on this depth measuremen t might be significant (Hagelberg et al., 1995), and the prediction o f tides is generally useful for guiding drilling to avoid gap alignmen t (Mix, Tiedemann, Blum, et al., 2003). However, during Expeditio n 361 the tidal range was small enough—at least relative to othe r sources of error (especially heave)—that it was not considered explicitly.  

The depth to a given position within any core is then determined relative to the DSF core top depth. The CSF-A scale therefor e combines the DSF core top depth with the curated depth within  a core after retrieval. The CSF-A depth scale is equivalent to the historical Deep Sea Drilling Project, ODP, and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program meters below seafloor (mbsf) scale and is specific t o each hole. It is important to note that the within-core position o f any given sedimentary feature may change after recovery under various influences such as the relief of overburden, gas-induced expansion, or water loss. Thus, error in the CSF-A scale includes bot h drilling effects as well as core expansion effects, and, as one consequence, the CSF-A scale permits overlaps between successive core s (e.g., caused by expansion) that are stratigraphically impossible. I n principle, the composite depth scale, described below, should rectify such artifacts.  

# Core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF-A)  

The construction of a common, composite depth scale for  a given IODP site involves identification of coeval, laterally continuous features in all drilled holes (which will generally occur at different depths on the CSF-A depth scales for each hole). Onc e correlative features were identified, then the depth of individua l cores was offset relative to CSF-A in that hole such that the feature s align on a common depth scale. The resulting CCSF-A scale i s equivalent to the historical ODP and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program meters composite depth (mcd) scale. In constructing th e CCSF-A scale, the depths of each individual core were offset by  a constant amount without stretching or squeezing within individua l cores. This composite depth scale provides good estimates of th e length of coring gaps and provides the basis for development of th e spliced record (on the CCSF-D scale). The vertical depth offset o f every core in every hole was tabulated in an affine table, one of th e principal “deliverables” of the stratigraphic correlator.  

In practice, the CCSF-A scale is built by correlating feature s downhole from the mudline. The mudline establishes the top of th e stratigraphic section, anchoring the entire composite depth scal e for all cores from all holes at a site. The compositing proceeds sequentially by establishing specific tie points among the variou s holes, working from the mudline (anchor) core to the bottom of th e drilled section. The CCSF-A scale very rarely (if ever) results i n alignment of all coeval features because of the differing effects o f coring-induced stretching and squeezing among cores, as well a s sedimentological differences between holes (Figure F7). Differentia l stretching proved to be problematic at some sites during Expeditio n 361, whereas it was essentially negligible in others (see individua l site summary chapters for details).  

In principle, if core gaps never come into alignment between al l holes at a site and recovery is sufficiently high, then it should b e possible to correlate each successive core in one hole to a core fro m an adjacent hole, all the way to the bottom of a drilled section. However, aligned coring gaps across all holes at a site are often difficul t to avoid. In the case of an aligned core gap, cores below the gap ar e no longer tied to the anchor core. They can, however, still be tied t o one another to produce correlated sections that are “floating” on th e CCSF-A scale. Such floating ties were denoted in the affine table a s “APPENDED” or “SET,” depending on whether the offset to the to p of that section was estimated by inheriting the absolute offset of th e core above or by assuming a constant growth rate (SCORS use r guide, unpublished). The SET method is preferable because estimates of the expansion of cores from the same hole can be considered, thus leading to more realistic approximation of coring gaps.  

During the process of constructing the composite section, th e CCSF-A depth becomes systematically larger than that of the CSFA depth for equivalent horizons. This expansion, typically as muc h as $\mathord{\sim}15\%$ , results primarily from decompression of the cores as the y are brought to the surface, gas expansion, stretching that occurs a s part of the coring process, and curation of material that has falle n downhole (e.g., Hagelberg et al., 1995; Acton et al., 2001).  

# Splice core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF-D)  

Once the CCSF-A scale was developed and the between-cor e gaps identified, a complete stratigraphic section (splice) was constructed by combining selected intervals between the previously established tie points. The depth scale is designated the CCSF- D scale. CCSF-D can be considered a subset of the CCSF-A dept h scale, because this D designation applies only to intervals include d in the splice. Intervals not included in the primary splice retain th e CCSF-A scale. In the case of aligned core gaps across all holes, an y spliced sections below the gap were appended to those above an d designated as floating splice sections. In principle, the amount o f  

Figure F7. Relationships between cored material and the depth scales use d during Expedition 361. The CSF-A scale is established by adding the curate d core length to the core top DSF depth. Core expansion creates apparen t overlaps and stratigraphic reversals when data are plotted on the CSF- A scale. The CCSF-A scale is constructed based on sequential identification o f distinct horizons identified in multiple holes at a given site, working fro m the top of the section downward (red dashed lines). The primary splic e (CCSF-D) is constructed by combining selected intervals between tie point s (yellow) such that coring gaps and disturbed section are excluded, resultin g in a complete stratigraphic section. CCSF-A depth designations are not necessarily equivalent to CCSF-D for intervals not included in the splice as illustrated by green dashed lines joining Horizon Q. Brown and yellow intervals $=$ recovered core, dashed and dotted lines $=$ equivalent horizons, red dashe d lines $=$ tie points aligning specific, easily recognized features.  

![](images/018a759ac854afdf7ba064a5593de95f0bf3633ed72aefab842a640742badb99.jpg)  

missing section between anchored and floating sections can be assessed using downhole logs. However, no logging was done durin g Expedition 361. Therefore, the default practice was to use the CSFA scale to estimate the length of the missing section in the splice.  

# Core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF-C)  

Once the splice is constructed, it is usually desirable to map int o the splice those intervals not included in the splice itself. This ca n be accomplished by treating the splice as a downhole log. The methodology is based on identification of correlative tie points at th e highest possible resolution, with linear adjustments of depths between ties. This is designated as the CCSF-C scale and can b e thought of as an “equivalent splice depth”. In the ideal case, th e CCSF-C and CCSF-D scales are equivalent. In reality, they are onl y equivalent to the extent that the correlations are accurate. At cor e boundaries, where strong stretching and compression are prevalent, these detailed depth maps will be less accurate. Tables of “equivalen t splice depth” were not generated shipboard during Expedition 361, but in most cases they should be straightforward to generate by using the shipboard affine tables as starting points. Further details an d guidance may be found in the individual site summary chapters.  

# Measurements and methods for correlation  

For the majority of sites, initial development of composite sections (CCSF-A scale) was based on the stratigraphic correlation o f magnetic susceptibility data sets acquired from the WRMSL an d the STMSL as soon as possible after core retrieval. This allowe d stratigraphic correlation to take place in near–real time such that bi t depth could be adjusted as necessary to avoid alignment of cor e gaps between holes. Real-time stratigraphic correlation was no t possible at the carbonate-rich sites devoid of any appreciable magnetic susceptibility signal; in these cases, spot-coring strategies wer e designed for later holes upon identification of potential gap alignment in the holes drilled earlier. No single variable proved to be universally powerful at all sites for stratigraphic correlation or splic e construction. Thus, at all sites, correlation proceeded through  a combination of WRMSL, STMSL, and digitized color reflectanc e data (R, G, B, $L^{\ast}$ , $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ , and $\mathfrak{b}^{\ast}$ ). Color reflectance data were extracte d from core images acquired from the SHIL and SHMSL. Magneti c susceptibility, GRA density, and $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ (or $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ and $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ ) were measured a t 2.5 or $4\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals, depending on the average sedimentation rat e at the site, whereas R, G, and B values were calculated at $0.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ intervals in the form of $0.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ averages measured continuously alon g a $1.5~\mathrm{cm}$ wide strip centered on digital color SHIL images. Detail s on instrument calibrations, settings, and measurement intervals fo r Expedition 361 are given in Physical properties.  

Compositing and splicing were accomplished using Correlato r software (version 2.1), from which standard affine tables (listings o f the vertical offset in meters added to each core in order to generat e the CCSF-A scales) and splice interval tables (listings of the specifi c core intervals used to construct the splice) were generated. Thes e tables were uploaded into the IODP LIMS database, which then affixes the appropriate depth scale to any associated data set.  

# Geochemistry  

The geochemistry program for Expedition 361 included characterization of headspace gases, interstitial water compositions, an d sedimentary geochemistry. These analyses were carried out to satisfy routine shipboard safety and pollution prevention requirements, to characterize interstitial water for sediment geochemistr y and shipboard interpretation, and to inform future researchers as t o the nature of the sediment. In addition, high-resolution interstitia l water sampling was performed at four of the six sites on cores fro m a dedicated hole to provide a large number of samples for shorebased research, as outlined in Ancillary Project Letter (APL) 845.  

# Sedimentary hydrocarbon gases  

The shipboard organic geochemistry monitoring program consisted of determining the composition and concentrations of volatile hydrocarbons $\left(C_{1}-C_{6}\right)$ in sediment in order to ensure that ga s content did not exceed amounts safe for drilling operations. Typically, one headspace gas sample was measured at the top of Sectio n 7 (Figure F8). The headspace gas sampling procedure involved placing $\{{\sim}5\ \mathrm{cm}^{3}}$ of sediment into a glass serum vial immediately following  core  retrieval.  The  glass  vial  was  sealed  with   a polytetrafluoroethylene/silicone septum and aluminum crimp ca p and heated at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $30\;\mathrm{min}$ to encourage gas generation from th e sediment. Following heating, a $5\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ volume of headspace gas fro m the headspace in the vial was removed with a gas-tight glass syring e for analysis by gas chromatography (GC).  

Headspace gas samples were analyzed using an Agilent 6890 ga s chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID).  A stainless steel GC column $2.4\:\mathrm{m}\times3.2\:\mathrm{mm}$ inner diameter) packe d with 80/100 mesh HayeSep R was used. The oven program starte d with a temperature of $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and held for $8.25\ \mathrm{min}$ before ramping a t $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ to $150^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , with a final hold time of $5\ \mathrm{min}$ , for a total ru n time of $15~\mathrm{min}$ per gas sample. Data were collected and evaluate d with an Agilent Chemstation data-handling program. Specifically, the instrument measures concentrations of methane $\left(C_{1}\right)$ , ethan e $\left(C_{2}\right)$ , ethene $\left(C_{2=}\right)$ , propane $\left(C_{3}\right)$ , and propene $\left(C_{3=}\right)$ . Chromatographic response was calibrated against known standards at the beginning of the expedition to determine concentrations in sediment. Gas standards were measured routinely to monitor data quality.  

# Interstitial water sampling  

# Whole-round samples  

Routine interstitial water was extracted from $5{-}10\ \mathrm{cm}$ long , whole-round sediment sections that were cut and capped immediately after core retrieval on deck. Samples were taken from the bottom of Section 6 in each core (Figure F8), with modifications a s indicated (seethe Geochemistry sections in each site chapter). Samples from more than one hole were treated as constituting a singl e depth profile (“splice”) using CCSF-A as the depth reference, if possible.  

High-resolution interstitial water sampling was done at Site s U1474–U1476 and U1478 in dedicated holes spanning a wate r depth range from 450 to $3040\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . High-resolution samples wer e taken either as $5{-}10\ \mathrm{cm}$ whole rounds or using Rhizon sampler s (Rhizosphere Research Products) as shown in Figure F8. No acetone was used to seal the end caps of the cut cores until after all whole-round samples were removed from the catwalk.  

In the shipboard laboratory, whole-round sediment sample s were removed from the core liner, and the outside surfaces $({\sim}1\;\mathrm{cm})$ of the sediment samples were carefully scraped off with spatulas t o minimize potential contamination with drill fluid. Each scrape d whole-round sediment sample was placed into a Manheim titaniu m squeezer and compressed at ambient temperature with a Carver hydraulic press (Manheim and Sayles, 1974). Interstitial water sample s discharged from the squeezer were passed through $0.45~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ polyethersulfone membrane filters, collected in acid-cleaned plastic sy  

Figure F8. Schematic of interstitial water (IW) sampling strategy for Hole  A and APL Hole B. Whole rounds (WR) for shipboard measurement were take n from Hole A, and additional samples were taken from APL Hole B in th e uppermost 3 cores at Sites U1474–U1476 and U1478. At non-APL Site s U1477 and U1479, additional WR samples were taken from the uppermost  3 cores in Hole A. High-resolution WR samples were also taken from the AP L Hole B at Sites U1474–U1476 and U1478. High-resolution Rhizon sample s were taken at Sites U1475 and U1476.  

![](images/30671a9195cf0aebf20e1b9e8cfb43c1729bbfb6d0337a893ed5bfbc4cd761b0.jpg)  

ringes, and stored in plastic sample tubes for shipboard analyses. Samples used for analysis by inductively coupled plasma–atomi c emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) were acidified with $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ in order to prevent precipitation of element complexes. Time betwee n squeezing and analysis ranged from 10 to $120\;\mathrm{min}$ .  

Samples saved for shore-based analyses were split into aliquot s as follows: for each whole round, two $5~\mathrm{mL}$ samples were flamesealed in glass ampules, one $10~\mathrm{mL}$ sample was stored in a $15~\mathrm{mL}$ Falcon tube that contained $500~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of $1\ M$ zinc acetate, and all remaining interstitial water was stored in trace metal–cleaned $30\;\mathrm{mL}$ high-density polyethylene (HDPE) Nalgene bottles, which wer e acidified with $50\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of trace metal–clean HCl.  

# Rhizon samples  

Rhizon samples were collected for shipboard nitrate analysi s and shore-based sampling at Sites U1475 and U1476. Rhizon sampling extracts interstitial water from sediment by suction filterin g into $10\,\mathrm{mL}$ plastic syringes through thin tubes of hydrophilic porou s polymer that has a mean pore diameter of $0.1\;{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ . Rhizon sampler s were inserted through holes drilled in the core liner along the lin e used to guide subsequent core splitting. Syringes were attached t o each Rhizon sampler with a Luer-lock, pulled to generate vacuum, and held open with wooden spacers. Samplers were left in plac e during core temperature equilibration $(\sim\!3\mathrm{~h})$ . Syringes were emptied to repull the vacuum on the Rhizon samplers at intervals o f ${\sim}30{-}60\ \mathrm{min}$ to increase yield. When necessary, Rhizon sampler s were used in pairs to sample from both sides of the whole-roun d core in order to retrieve enough volume from a given depth. Wate r from both samplers was combined into one sample and shaken t o mix before analysis and splitting. Samples were split into plasti c sample tubes for shipboard and shore-based analyses and store d frozen.  

Before deployment, new and previously used Rhizon sampler s were soaked in $18.2\,\mathrm{M}\Omega$ deionized water for several hours, followe d by rinsing with $30~\mathrm{mL}$ of $18.2\;\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water that was suction-filtere d through each Rhizon sampler. After washing, Rhizon samplers wer e left to dry on filter paper. Care was taken to only use completely dr y Rhizon samplers. Blanks consisting of 18.2 MΩ water pulle d through new and recycled Rhizon samplers analyzed for nitrate onboard, as described below, were all below detection limit.  

# Shipboard interstitial water analyses  

Interstitial water samples were analyzed on board the ship following the protocols in Gieskes et al. (1991), Murray et al. (2000), and the IODP user manuals for shipboard instrumentation.  

# Salinity, alkalinity, and pH  

Salinity, alkalinity, and pH were measured as soon as possible after squeezing, following the procedures in Gieskes et al. (1991). Salinity was measured using a Fisher temperature-compensate d handheld refractometer, $\mathsf{p H}$ was measured with a combined glas s electrode, and alkalinity was determined by Gran titration with a n autotitrator (Metrohm 794 basic Titrino) using $0.1\ M\,{\mathrm{HCl}}$ at $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Ocean s (IAPSO) standard seawater was used for calibration and was analyzed, at least, at the beginning and end of a set of samples for eac h site. Repeated alkalinity analyses of an IAPSO standard yielded  a precision better than $6\%$ .  

# Chloride  

Chloride concentrations were acquired using a Metrohm 78 5 DMP autotitrator and silver nitrate $\mathrm{(AgNO_{3})}$ solution calibrate d against repeated titrations of an IAPSO standard. A $0.5~\mathrm{mL}$ aliquo t of sample was diluted with $10\;\mathrm{mL}$ of $90\pm2\mathrm{\mM\,HNO_{3}}$ and titrate d with $0.1778\mathrm{~M~AgNO}_{3}$ . Repeated analyses of an IAPSO standar d yielded a precision better than $4\%$ .  

# Ion chromatograph analysis of sulfate and major cations  

Interstitial water $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ concentrations were measured by io n chromatography using the Metrohm 850 Professional ion chromatograph and calibrated against an IAPSO standard. A large seawater sample collected at the start of the expedition was filtered, homogenized, and used as an internal standard, which was run every 5 samples.  

Major cations $(\mathrm{M}\mathrm{g}^{2+}$ , $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{K^{+}}$ , and $\mathrm{Na^{+^{\prime}}}$ ) were also determine d by ion chromatography on the same 1:200 dilutions used for sulfat e determinations.  

# Nitrate  

Nitrate concentrations were analyzed with a Metrohm 84 4 UV/VIS compact ion chromatograph (provided by the University o f Rhode Island Geobiology Laboratory). A $150\ \mathrm{\mm}\ \times\ 4.0\ \mathrm{\mm}$ Metrosep A SUPP 8 150 column was used. The column oven was se t at $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The eluent was a $10\%$ NaCl solution filtered through a 0.4 5 $\upmu\mathrm{m}$ filter. Approximately $0.8\ \mathrm{mL}$ of interstitial water was injecte d manually into a $250~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ sample loop. Absorption at the $215\,\mathrm{\,nm}$ channel was used for quantification. A dilution series of sodium nitrate/nitrite standard (Fluka, ion chromatography standard 100 0 $\mathrm{mg/L})$ was run after every fifth sample. Repeated analysis of a prepared potassium nitrate solution yielded a precision of better tha n $3\%$ .  

# Phosphate  

Phosphate concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry using an Agilent Technologies Cary Series 100 UV-visibl e spectrophotometer with a sipper sample introduction system following the protocol in Gieskes et al. (1991). In the phosphat e method, orthophosphate reacts with $\mathrm{Mo}(\mathrm{VI})$ and Sb(III) in an acidi c solution to form an antimony-phosphomolybdate complex. Ascorbic acid reduces this complex, forming a blue color that is measure d at $880\ \mathrm{nm}$ . Potassium phosphate monobasic $\left(\mathrm{KH}_{2}\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)$ dissolved i n $18.2~\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water was used to produce a calibration curve with 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60, 100, 200, and $300\ \upmu\mathrm{M}$ concentrations to check fo r instrument linearity. The $10\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ standard was used to test accurac y and drift during the analytical runs. While measuring samples fo r Site U1479, the blank values were high and exceptionally variable. The flow cell was replaced, resulting in much lower (near zero) an d reproducible blank measurements. Measurements prior to replacing the flow cell, in particular for Site U1478, may be less precise; however, we believe that the observed trends and the shapes of th e downhole profiles are robust.  

# ICP-AES analysis of major and minor elements  

A Teledyne Prodigy high-precision ICP-AES was used to analyze the concentrations of major and minor elements in interstitial water following the methods outlined in ODP Technical Note 29 (Murray et al., 2000). The ICP-AES was calibrated for major elements ${\mathrm{Mg}}^{2+}$ , $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{K^{+}}$ , and $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ using sequential dilutions of IAPS O standard seawater. For the analysis of major elements, standard s and samples were diluted $1{:}100\ \mathrm{(v/v)}$ with $2\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ containing 1 0 ppm Y, which served as an internal standard. A multielement synthetic standard was prepared from single-element standards an d was used to calibrate the ICP-AES for minor elements $M{{\Omega}^{2+}}$ , $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ , B, Si, $S\ensuremath{\mathbf{r}}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{Ba^{2+}}$ , and $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ . Calibrations were done with every run. Samples for the analysis of minor elements were diluted $1{:}10\ \mathrm{(v/v)}$ wit h the same $2\%\ \mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ containing $10\ \mathrm{ppm\Y}$ solution as was used fo r the major element analysis. A drift-monitor solution containing al l elements of interest was analyzed every 8 samples to provide a baseline for drift correction throughout the analytical run. The introduction system was rinsed with $3\%\ensuremath{\mathrm{\HNO}_{3}}$ wash solution after eac h sample and standard. The calibrated concentration range for eac h element is given in Table T7. Typical internal precision was $-3\%$ (relative standard deviation [RSD]). External precision was generally $-3\%$ based on three replicates of a filtered seawater consistenc y standard. Blank values for the minor elements are given for each analytical session in Table T8.  

Multiple wavelengths were measured for each element, and th e wavelengths used for the reporting of the elemental concentratio n data were selected based on possible interferences, the linearity o f calibration curves, and the precision and accuracy of IAPSO seawater measurements.  

# Bulk sediment geochemistry  

# Inorganic carbon content  

Total inorganic carbon concentrations were determined using  a UIC 5011 $C O_{2}$ coulometer. Samples of ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{~mg~}$ of freeze-dried, ground sediment were weighed and reacted with $5\ \mathrm{mL}\ 2\ \mathrm{M}\ \mathrm{HCl}$ . The liberated $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ was titrated, and a photodetector was used fo r end-point determination. Calcium carbonate content, expressed a s weight percent, was calculated from the TIC content assuming tha t all inorganic carbon is present as calcium carbonate:  

$$
\mathrm{wt}_{70}^{\%}\,\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}=\mathrm{(wt}_{70}^{\%}\,\mathrm{TIC)}\times8.33.
$$  

Accuracy and precision were monitored by replicate analyses o f selected samples, as well as a pure $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ standard (approximatel y every 10 samples). Typical precision was $1\%$ for 5 replicate analyse s of a carbonate sample.  

# Organic carbon content  

Total organic carbon content was calculated as the differenc e between total carbon (TC) and TIC:  

$$
\mathrm{wt^{0}/o\ T O C=(w t^{0}/o\ T C)-(w t^{0}/o\ T I C).}
$$

TC content was determined on aliquots of the same sample s that were analyzed for TIC using a Thermo Electron Flash EA 111 2 elemental analyzer equipped with a Thermo Electron packed G C column CHNS/NCS (polytetrafluoroethylene; length $=2\,\mathrm{m};$ ; diameter $=6\ \mathrm{mm}\times5\ \mathrm{mm}$ ) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Aliquots of ${\sim}10~\mathrm{mg}$ of freeze-dried, ground sediment were weighe d into tin cups and then combusted in the instrument reactor ove n with a pulse of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ . Nitrogen oxides were reduced to $\mathrm{N}_{2},$ and th e mixture of gases produced was separated by GC at $65^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and measured by the TCD. All TOC measurements were calibrated by comparison to a pure sulfanilamide standard, giving a reproducibility o f TOC from $\pm0.03$ to $\pm0.06\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ $\left[1\upsigma;N=5\right)$ , with a typical detectio n limit of $0.03\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . Sulfanilamide check standards were run after every 10 samples.  

Computing TOC by difference, the subtraction of inorganic carbon (IC) measured by coulometry from TC measured on the elemental analyzer, when TC and IC are both large numbers, results i n small and variable estimates of TOC that are neither accurate no r precise. When deemed a potential problem, TOC was measured after removing the IC fraction by acidification. Approximately $10~\mathrm{mg}$ of each sample was weighed into silver cups and $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of nanopur e water and $300~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of $1\;\mathrm{M}\;\mathrm{HCl}_{:}$ , in $50\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ aliquots, were added to eac h cup to remove carbonate. Complete removal was assessed visuall y with the addition of more acid. Samples were dried completely, folded, placed into tin cups to ensure complete combustion, and analyzed in the elemental analyzer.

# Major and trace element concentrations  

Major and trace element concentrations were measured for  a subset of the freeze-dried, ground sediment sampled for percen t carbonate analyses. Samples were processed using lithium metaborate $\mathrm{(LiBO_{2})}$ flux fusion according to the procedure outlined i n ODP Technical Note 29 (Murray et al., 2000). A set of five to six roc k and sediment standards was prepared with each batch of sample s (Table T9). The standards were heated in an oven for $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $100^{\circ}C$ and then cooled before weighing. For analysis, $100\pm0.5~\mathrm{mg}$ of sample or standard was mixed with $400\,\pm\,5~\mathrm{mg}$ of $\mathrm{LiBO}_{2}$ flux, transferred into a Pt-Au crucible along with $10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of $0.172\mathrm{~mM}$ LiB r wetting agent, and fused at $1050^{\circ}C$ for $10{-}12\,\mathrm{min}$ . After cooling, th e fused bead was dissolved in $50\;\mathrm{mL}$ of a $10\%$ nitric acid solution an d filtered through an Acrodisc. A $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ aliquot of the filtered sampl e solution was diluted with $35\;\mathrm{mL}$ of $10\%\,\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ to give a total volum e of $40~\mathrm{{mL}}$ and a $4000\times$ (nominal) dilution. With each batch of samples, $400~\mathrm{mg}$ of $\mathrm{LiBO}_{2}$ was fused alone and processed as a procedural blank.  

Major and trace elements were analyzed simultaneously using  a Teledyne  Prodigy  high-precision ICP-AES  following  a simila r method as described for interstitial water. A calibration was performed for each run using the standard reference materials processed with each batch of samples. A mixture of several samples wa s used as a drift monitor solution and analyzed every 8 samples. Typical internal precision was ${\sim}3\%$ RSD. Blank values for the major an d minor elements are given for each analytical session in Table T10.
