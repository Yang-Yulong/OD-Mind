# Abstract  

The five primary sites proposed for International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expeditio n 395, which was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, were cored during IODP Expedition 395C. The Expedition 395C operations, shipboard measurements, and sampling wer e adjusted to account for the absence of a sailing science party. The Expedition 395/395C objective s are (1) to investigate temporal variations in ocean crust generation at the Reykjanes Ridge and tes t hypotheses for the influence of Iceland mantle plume fluctuations on these processes, (2) to analyze sedimentation rates at the Björn and Gardar contourite drifts, as proxies for Cenozoic variations of North Atlantic deepwater circulation, and for uplift and subsidence of the GreenlandScotland Ridge gateway related to plume activity, and (3) to analyze the alteration of oceanic crus t and its interaction with seawater and sediments. During Expedition 395C, basalt cores were collected at four sites: U1554, U1555, U1562, and U1563. Sediment cores were also collected fro m these sites as well as from Site U1564, and casing was installed to $602\,\mathrm{m}$ at Site U1554. The amoun t of recovered cores, their preliminary descriptions, and the analyses of shipboard samples sho w that the results of Expedition 395C will fulfill a significant part of the Expedition 395 objectives. Basalts were collected from two V-shaped ridge and trough pairs, which will allow the investigation of the variability in mantle source and temperature causing this ridge/trough pattern. Basal t cores span an expected age range of $2.8–13.9\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , which will allow us to investigate the hydrothermal weathering processes. Sediments from the Björn drift were cored to basement, along with th e uppermost $600\,\mathrm{m}$ of sediments from the Gardar drift. The data provided by Expedition 395C are  a major advancement in achieving the work of Expedition 395.  

# 1. Introduction  

Mantle plumes bring significant amounts of mass and heat up from Earth’s deep interior, causin g melting and volcanism in places like Iceland and Hawaii and long-wavelength uplift at the surface. Tracking plume behavior through geologic time is difficult; however, where a plume intersects  a plate-spreading mid-ocean ridge (MOR), direct observations of the composition and fluid dynamical behavior of such upwellings are feasible. Basaltic rocks continuously erupted near the spreading axis record the geochemical signature of the underlying mantle, providing a record of th e composition and dynamics of the mantle plume. In addition, over time, basalts spread away fro m the ridge and interact with the overlying seawater and sediments, becoming progressively altere d due to hydrothermal circulation and chemical exchanges.  

One such plume-ridge system can be found in the North Atlantic Ocean, where the Iceland mantl e plume is bisected by the Reykjanes Ridge, the submarine portion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge southwest of Iceland. Basins around the Reykjanes Ridge are blanketed by rapidly accumulating sediments that record the oceanographic conditions on thousand-year timescales, providing some o f the most detailed climate records on Earth. The Reykjanes Ridge flanks host a series of V-shape d crustal ridges and troughs whose origin has been long debated. These ridges could be explained i f the Iceland mantle plume was pulsing at a frequency of several millions of years, causing mel t anomalies, and driving transient uplift of the surrounding North Atlantic region on geologica l timescales. Vertical motions caused by this pulsing behavior could have altered the depth of th e oceanic gateways connecting the Norwegian and Greenland Seas into the North Atlantic Ocean, with implications for deepwater circulation, sediment deposition, and climate. The unique juxtaposition of a mantle plume, a spreading ridge, oceanic gateways, and rapidly accumulating sediment provide an ideal natural laboratory to test multidisciplinary ideas about the interaction s between Earth’s deep and surficial domains.  

# 2. Background  

# 2.1. Geological setting  

As new basaltic oceanic crust is formed, it draws material from the underlying mantle, so rock s recovered from MORs have long been used to measure the thermal and compositional propertie s of the mantle (e.g., Krause and Schilling, 1969; Hart et al., 1973; Schilling, 1973). Where MOR s intersect mantle plumes, such as along the Reykjanes and Kolbeinsey Ridges near Iceland, oceani c crustal accretion is thought to be influenced by plume activity (e.g., White, 1997). Close agreement between models of dynamic topography and seismic tomography supports the idea tha t mantle upwelling beneath Iceland influences the entire North Atlantic region today (Hartley et al., 2011; Rickers et al., 2013; Schoonman et al., 2017) (Figure F1). A possible sign of time-dependen t plume behavior is the set of diachronous V-shaped ridges (VSRs) and V-shaped troughs (VSTs ) that straddle the Reykjanes Ridge south of Iceland (Figure F1). Vogt (1971) first suggested that th e VSRs reflect variations in crustal thickness caused by pulses of hotter asthenosphere advectin g horizontally away from the Iceland plume that episodically increase the thickness of crust forme d at the axis.  

Oceanic crustal accretion is sensitive to small temperature perturbations, which can change th e thickness of newly formed material by hundreds of meters to kilometers (White et al., 1995). Th e ratios between incompatible trace elements such as Nb/Y are largely insensitive to crustal processes such as fractional crystallization and reflect the depth and degree of melting. A southwar d decrease of Nb/Y on the Reykjanes Ridge correlates with deepening of the axis, a decrease i n crustal thickness, and decreasing source enrichment estimated by isotopic indicators such a s $^{87}\mathrm{Sr}/^{86}\mathrm{Sr}$ (Murton et al., 2002; Shorttle and Maclennan, 2011). Two complete cycles of variation i n incompatible trace element ratios that can be observed along axis correlate with patterns in gravit y anomaly, bathymetry, and earthquake seismicity (Parnell-Turner et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2014). Compositional variations associated with VSRs cannot be explained by fractional crystallizatio n alone because a corresponding variation in $\mathrm{Mg}$ number is absent. Because enrichment in incompatible trace elements is inversely correlated with crustal thickness over the past $12\ \mathrm{My}$ , mantl e temperature variation is thought to play an important role in controlling crustal thickness, in addition to changes in mantle source fusibility (Poore et al., 2011; Parnell-Turner et al., 2017).  

Since Vogt’s early thermal pulsing hypothesis, the origin of the VSRs has been debated (Figure F2 ) (e.g., Parnell-Turner et al., 2014). One alternative idea is that the VSRs may be tectonic in origi n and have no requirement for hotspot melt anomalies (Briais and Rabinowicz, 2002; Rabinowic z and Briais, 2002; Benediktsdóttir et al., 2012). In this hypothesis, a sequence of propagating rift s and southward migrating discontinuities, suggested by the observed asymmetric accretion at th e ridge axis, explains the formation of VSRs and VSTs, which are thought to represent ridge segments and pseudofault scarps, respectively (Figure F2B). A third hypothesis, in which shallo w buoyant mantle upwelling instabilities propagate along axis to form the observed crustal structure, has also been suggested; it avoids the requirement for rapid mantle plume flow (Martinez and Hey, 2017; Martinez et al., 2020) (Figure F2C).

Crust on the Reykjanes Ridge was last drilled in 1978 during Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Le g 49 when basalts were recovered at three sites (407–409) located on VSRs. A total basalt thicknes s of $453\;\mathrm{m}$ was penetrated (Luyendyk et al., 1979), leading to a series of breakthroughs in our understanding of the nature and scale of mantle heterogeneity and crustal accretion under the influenc e of a mantle plume (e.g., Wood et al., 1979; Dupré and Allègre, 1980; Fitton et al., 1997). The deepest basement penetration was at Site 409, located $23\,\mathrm{km}$ from the ridge axis, where $240\;\mathrm{m}$ of vesicular basalt was drilled in the $2.4\;\mathrm{Ma}$ crust; however, the other Leg 49 sites are on older crust (3 6 and $20\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ) and did not attempt to recover basalts from a VST. Hence, Leg 49 basalts alone are no t able to unravel the origins of VSRs and VSTs and do not provide detailed stepwise informatio n about the aging of oceanic crust.  

The North Atlantic Ocean is separated from the colder, more dense waters of the Arctic Ocea n and Norwegian-Greenland Sea by the Greenland-Scotland Ridge, which represents a critical gateway affecting Cenozoic deepwater circulation patterns and climate. The Greenland-Scotlan d Ridge is generally less than 500 meters below sea level (mbsl) and is only ${\sim}1000\,\mathrm{mbsl}$ at its deepes t point, making the overflow flux sensitive to small variations in the ridge depth. Reconstructions o f Neogene mantle plume activity correlate with deepwater circulation patterns in the North Atlantic (Wright and Miller, 1996). Times of high mantle plume activity are linked to low Norther n Component Water productivity, increased current strength, and sedimentary deposition rate s (Wright and Miller, 1996; Poore et al., 2006; Parnell-Turner et al., 2015). Southward-flowing deepwater currents in the North Atlantic Ocean deposit fine-grained sediments called contourit e drifts, which accumulate at rates of hundreds of meters per million years. Two contourite drifts, Gardar and Björn, were successfully drilled during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 162 (Janse n and Raymo, 1996), providing a record of drift sedimentation back to early Pleistocene times (1. 7 Ma). High sedimentation rate combined with near $100\%$ core recovery rates means that these site s contain some of the highest resolution records of ocean circulation and climate to date (Kleiven e t al., 2011; Thornalley et al., 2013). These records can be directly compared to atmospheric record s from ice cores and provide a unique, high-resolution insight into the Earth’s climatic past (Barke r et al., 2019).

# 2.2. Site survey data  

A detailed geophysical survey of the Reykjanes Ridge and its flanks was conducted in June–Jul y 2010 during RRS James Cook Cruise JC50, collecting more than ${\sim}2400~\mathrm{km}$ of 2-D multichanne l reflection seismic data (Parnell-Turner et al., 2015, 2017). The survey consisted of two basin-spanning regional seismic reflection profiles, oriented parallel to plate-spreading flow lines, and  a series of 19 shorter perpendicular crossing lines. These multichannel data are of sufficient qualit y to identify the sediment/basement interface as well as potential drilling hazards such as faults, ga s accumulations, and stratigraphic discontinuities. Primary and alternate sites were positioned o n thick sediment or in localized sedimentary basins that are imaged on seismic reflection profiles s o that holes can easily be established. Sites were chosen as close to crossing seismic profiles as possible while avoiding sedimentary disturbances, faults, and basement discontinuities. Sedimen t thicknesses are estimated using interval sediment velocities from Leg 162 where possible, an d stacking velocities are used for deeper levels.  

# 3. Scientific objectives  

In March 2021, the JOIDES Resolution Facility Board, the JOIDES Resolution Science Operato r (JRSO), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) decided to postpone International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 395 because of travel risks associated with the COVID-1 9 pandemic. Instead, IODP Expedition 395C was scheduled to undertake Expedition 395 operation s that could be completed without a science party on board. These restrictions prevented the usua l laboratory analysis and core description efforts. For example, it was not feasible to collect and analyze high-resolution ephemeral properties through the analysis and collection of interstitial por e water fluid samples or possible to generate the usual at-sea products such as a preliminary biostratigraphic age model. All core description will take place during a shore-based postcruise meeting. In light of these limitations, operational and laboratory objectives for Expedition 395C wer e adjusted so that they were achievable by the shipboard JRSO technical staff during a single expedition, with remote input from the scientific party.  

Expedition 395C had three central objectives: (1) to test contrasting hypotheses for the formatio n of VSRs, (2) to understand temporal changes in ocean circulation and explore connections wit h plume activity, and (3) to reconstruct the evolving chemistry of hydrothermal fluids with increasing crustal age and varying sediment thickness and crustal architecture.  

To address these objectives, Expedition 395C was planned to obtain basement cores at four site s that represent two VSR/VST pairs and also install a reentry system and core and log the rapidl y deposited sedimentary section of Björn drift deposits that lie above the basement. Expeditio n 395C also tentatively aimed to core the sedimentary section of the Gardar drift (Site U1564) t o allow further drilling to basement at that site at a later date. The majority of operations at th e sediment drift sites (Sites U1554 and U1562) were postponed to Expedition 395 because high cor e recovery necessitates the presence of a sailing science party. Single advanced piston corer (APC ) holes were planned at each site, with the expectation that triple APC coring would follow during  a later expedition. At each site, $200\,\textrm{m}$ of basement penetration was initially planned in light o f depth-increasing trends in basalt composition (e.g., Ti concentration and $\mathrm{Zr/Y}$ ) observed in IOD P Expedition 384 Hole U1555G. A portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (pXRF) scanning uni t was planned to be used to monitor basement cores for this trend to decide whether $200\;\mathrm{m}$ of basement was necessary at other sites (see Site summaries for details).  

# 3.1. Objective 1: origin of V-shaped ridges  

We will use the composition of basaltic samples to understand crustal formation south of Icelan d at two temporal scales. First, on ${\sim}5{-}10$ My timescales, we seek to test three alternative hypothese s for the formation of VSRs: (1) thermal pulsing, (2) propagating rifts, and (3) buoyant mantl e upwelling. Drilling will allow us to test these hypotheses, which predict differing depths, temperatures, and degrees of melting between VSRs and VSTs recorded in basalt composition. Dredge d samples are restricted to the ridge axis because deep-sea corals and sediments cover off-axis area s (Jones et al., 2002; Murton et al., 2002). Hence, off-axis VSRs and VSTs can only be sampled b y drilling. Our objective of understanding how crustal formation responds to mantle temperature, degree of melting, and plume activity will be achieved by comparing the geochemistry of basalt s from smooth and segmented crustal domains. Expedition 395C sites, located along a spreadingparallel flow line, avoid the issue of variable distance from the plume. Incompatible trace elemen t concentrations and ratios (e.g., Nb/Y and $\mathrm{La}/\mathrm{Sm})$ ) will be used to constrain melting models, building upon previous work on the axis. Indirect reconstruction of axial depth is possible using volatil e elements such as carbon, water, and sulfur, which degas when erupted at the seafloor. For example, advances in understanding the $C O_{2}$ concentration in ridge basalts enable quantification of eruption pressure (Le Voyer et al., 2017). Recovery of glass (achieved during Leg 49) will enable electron and ion-probe analyses to measure volatile elements and therefore estimate eruptio n pressures and test the plume pulsing hypothesis.  

# 3.2. Objective 2: oceanic circulation, magnetic paleointensity, and sedimentation  

We plan to quantify how oceanic circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean has varied since Oligocene times. Deepwater flow in the North Atlantic is dominated by two oceanic gateways, the Iceland-Faroe Ridge and the Denmark Strait, that control the southward flow of water from th e Norwegian Sea and exert a major influence on global ocean circulation (Figure F1). The rate o f accumulation of contourite drift sediments in the North Atlantic Ocean is primarily controlled b y deepwater flow along bathymetric rises; hence, the strength and pathways of deepwater current s are recorded by these drift sediments (Figure F3) (e.g., Wright and Miller, 1996). These deposit s provide an indirect proxy for temporal variations in deepwater flow. Additionally, short-term climatic effects relating to the location of oceanic fronts during both glacial–interglacial an d (shorter) stadial–interstadial cycles may play a role in circulation patterns on shorter timescale s (thousands of years). It has been suggested that uplift and subsidence of the Iceland-Faroe Ridg e and Denmark Strait is influenced by mantle upwelling beneath Iceland and that there may therefore be an indirect connection between ocean circulation and mantle plume behavior (Poore et al., 2011; Parnell-Turner et al., 2015). We plan to test the correlation between mantle plume activit y and ocean circulation by using sediment accumulation rates as a first-order proxy for deepwate r current strength. In addition, high sedimentation rates of contourite drift deposits in the Nort h Atlantic Ocean $(12{-}16\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ have led to paleomagnetic and isotopic records that are among th e most detailed available (Channell et al., 2002). Existing boreholes provide high-resolution climat e records back to $1.7\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (ODP Site 983), and Expedition 395C aims to extend the high-resolutio n climate record further into late Pliocene times.  

# 3.3. Objective 3: time-dependent hydrothermal alteration of oceanic crust  

Expedition 395C will investigate the nature, extent, timing, and duration of hydrothermal alteration in the Reykjanes Ridge flank. Hydrothermal circulation along MORs and across their flank s is responsible for one-third of the heat loss through the ocean crust. Fluid circulation influence s tectonic, magmatic, and microbial processes on a global scale and is a fundamental component o f global biogeochemical cycles. There is also growing evidence that the long-term carbon cycle i s influenced by the reaction of seawater with the oceanic crust in low-temperature, off-axis hydrothermal systems, perhaps representing an important mechanism for carbon drawdown (e.g., Gilli s and Coogan, 2011). The relative contribution of this process remains controversial because w e don’t know how much low-temperature alteration takes place off axis. Although the nature of th e individual hydrothermal fluid rock reactions is generally understood, the magnitude and distribution of chemical exchange remain poorly quantified, as does the partitioning between high- an d low-temperature exchange with crustal age. Consequently, the role of the production, hydrothermal alteration, and subsequent subduction of ocean crust in key global geochemical cycle s remains uncertain. Drilled sections of hydrothermally altered crust from the Reykjanes Ridg e flank will provide time-integrated records of geochemical exchange between crust and seawate r along an age transect from 2.8 to $13.9\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Figure F3). These sections will enable us to quantify th e timing and extent of hydrothermal fluid–rock exchange across the Reykjanes Ridge flank and t o assess the hydrothermal contributions of a rapidly sedimented slow-spreading ridge flank t o global geochemical budgets. Expedition 395C sites comprise a crustal flow line transect across th e eastern flank of Reykjanes Ridge. The recovered cores will sample the uppermost ${\sim}130\;\mathrm{m}$ of lava s produced at 2.8, 5.2, 12.7, and $13.9\,\mathrm{Ma}$ at the slow-spreading Reykjanes Ridge, which will provid e a unique opportunity to quantify the timing and extent of hydrothermal fluid–rock exchange in  a slow-spreading ridge flank that experienced rapid sedimentation and variations in tectonic architecture.

# 4.1. Beginning of expedition and transit  

Expedition 395C officially began at $0818\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 June 2021 with the first line ashore at Skarfabakk i Harbor in Reykjavík, Iceland. The JRSO team and ship’s crew isolated in their hotel rooms in Reykjavík, following the JRSO’s COVID-19 quarantine and testing procedures prior to boarding on  8 June. During the quarantine period, the off-going crew handled freight and virtual crossover meetings took place. The majority of the JRSO staff and ship’s crew moved onto the vessel the mornin g of 8 June. The remaining staff and crew, who arrived in Reykjavík a day later, joined the vessel on  9  

June. The final member of the JRSO staff boarded the vessel the morning of 11 June, and the pilo t boarded the ship at $0852\,\mathrm{h}$ . After some difficulties with the mooring lines, the ship left the doc k with the last line away at $0948~\mathrm{h}$ . At $1000\ \mathrm{h}_{!}$ , the pilot departed and the ship began the $312\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1555. The ship averaged $11.6\,\mathrm{kt}$ and arrived at Site U1555 at $1225\,\mathrm{h}$ on 12 June. Th e thrusters were lowered, and the vessel switched to dynamic positioning (DP) mode, beginnin g Hole U1555H at $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

# 4.2. Site U1555  

# 4.2.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1555 (proposed Site REYK-13A of Expedition 395) is located in the North Atlantic Ocea n along the Reykjanes Ridge south of Iceland. Site U1555 is located at the intersection of Seismi c Lines JC50-1 (common midpoint [CMP] 57881) and JC50-C7 (CMP 3720), obtained in 201 0 during RRS James Cook Cruise JC50 (Parnell-Turner et al., 2017). Site U1555 is located on VST- 1 with an estimated basement age of $2.8\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Cores and data from this site will address two of th e primary science objectives: (1) crustal accretion and mantle behavior and (2) time-dependen t hydrothermal alteration of oceanic crust.  

The operational objectives for this site were to core the sedimentary section using the APC an d extended core barrel (XCB) systems to the sediment/basement interface, use the rotary core barre l (RCB) system to core ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ into the basement, and use downhole wireline tools to log the borehole. All of the planned operations are in support of Expedition 395, which was postponed twic e because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  

Operations at Site U1555 first occurred in August 2020 during Expedition 384 (Blum et al., 2020). Holes U1555A–U1555E were drilled through the sedimentary section and into the underlyin g basement to test different hard rock drill bits. Holes U1555F and U1555G were cored in support o f Expedition 395 objectives and recovered $68.64\mathrm{~m~}$ of basalt basement. In addition to coring, Hol e U1555G was logged with downhole tools.

# 4.2.2.1. Transit to Site U1555  

The R/V JOIDES Resolution departed Reykjavík, Iceland, on 11 June 2021. The pilot boarded th e ship at $0852~\mathrm{h}$ , and after some difficulties with the mooring lines, the ship left the dock with th e last line away at $0948\,\mathrm{h}$ . At $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ , the pilot departed and the ship began the $312\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Sit e U1555. The ship averaged $11.6~\mathrm{kt}$ and arrived at Site U1555 at $1225\ \mathrm{h}$ on 12 June. The thruster s were lowered, and the vessel switched to DP mode, beginning Hole U1555H at $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

# 4.2.2.2. Hole U1555H  

Hole U1555H $\!\!\{60^{\circ}13.6924^{\prime}\mathrm{N}}$ , $28^{\circ}30.0240^{\prime}\mathrm{W}]$ ) was positioned $12\;\mathrm{m}$ northwest of Hole U1555F. Th e crew began to assemble the drill collars until the weather deteriorated with winds blowing up to 4 0 kt. From 1645 to $2045~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 June 2021, the vessel waited on weather. After the wind subsided, the crew continued to assemble the drill collars and made up the drill bit. The drill string wa s advanced to 1518.6 mbsl and positioned to fire the first APC core to establish the seafloor depth.  

Coring in Hole U1555H was initiated at $0650\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 June. Core 395C-U1555H-1H recovered  a good mudline with $5~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment, placing the seafloor depth at 1523.6 mbsl. Cores $\mathrm{1H-10H}$ were cored to $90.5~\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth below seafloor (DSF). Following Core $10\mathrm{H}$ , $150\;\mathrm{m}$ of the cor e winch line was cut to remove a damaged section. Coring continued with Cores 11H–15H to $138\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Coring was interrupted when the core winch line became stuck in the oil saver sub on the to p drive. After removing, cutting, and reheading the line, coring continued with Cores 16H–18 H $^{(138-166.5\;\mathrm{m}}$ DSF). The XCB system was deployed for the remaining cores. Core 19X was onl y advanced $^{6\textrm{m}}$ to ensure that Core 20X would drill through the sediment/basement interface, which was encountered at $176.5~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The final depth of Hole U1555H was $177.5\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. Th e crew began tripping the pipe, and the bit cleared the seafloor at $1525\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 June. At $2000\,\mathrm{h}$ , th e bit cleared the rotary table, ending Hole U1555H.  

All APC cores were collected using nonmagnetic core barrels and oriented using the Icefield MI- 5 core orientation tool. Formation temperature measurements were collected on Cores 395CU1555H-4H, 7H, 10H, and 13H using the third-generation advanced piston corer temperatur e (APCT-3) tool.  

A total of $180.06\;\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered from Hole U1555H with $101\%$ recovery. The APC system collected 18 cores over a $166.88\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with $166.58\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered $(100\%)$ . Two cores wer e taken using the XCB system over a $12.67\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with $13.48\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered $(106\%)$ .  

# 4.2.2.3. Hole U1555I  

The ship was offset $24~\mathrm{m}$ east-southeast of Hole U1555H for operations in Hole U1555I. As th e crew worked to assemble the drill string and RCB bottom-hole assembly (BHA), the weather deteriorated, and at $0315\mathrm{~h~}$ on 15 June 2021, operations paused while the vessel waited on weather. Winds picked up to over $30\,\mathrm{kt}$ with waves up to $5.5\;\mathrm{m}$ over the course of the day. After $30\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , operations resumed at $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 June.  

Hole U1555I ( $60^{\circ}13.6897^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $28^{\circ}29.9984^{\prime}\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{J}}$ ) was spudded at $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 June and drilled withou t core recovery to $159.3\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF (drilled interval 395C-U1555I-11). The RCB system was used to cu t all cores from Hole U1555I. Cores 2R and 3R were collected from 159.3 to $178.7\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF with $77\%$ sediment recovery, and the sediment/basement interface was encountered at $176.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Core s 4R–6R $^{178.7-207.8\textrm{m I}}$ DSF) were cut using $9.7\textrm{m}$ coring advances. Beginning with Core 7R, th e drill string advances alternated between 5 and $4.7~\mathrm{m}$ for each core to prevent the core from jamming inside the barrel and improve core recovery. Mud sweeps were performed following Core 8 R because hole conditions had deteriorated. Coring continued with Cores 9R–26R $(227.2–304.8\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF). After cutting Core 26R, the drill bit reached 49 rotating hours and needed to be switche d out.  

At $0320~\mathrm{h}$ on 20 June, a free-fall funnel (FFF) was installed to allow reentry into the hole. Th e subsea camera was deployed to observe the placement of the FFF and to ensure that the pipe di d not move it out of position when the bit exited the hole. The Conductivity-Temperature-Dept h (CTD) sonde was run on the subsea camera frame to collect temperature, pressure, and conductivity measurements of the seawater. The bit cleared the seafloor and the FFF at $0450\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , the subse a camera was retrieved, and the bit cleared the rotary table at $0930\,\mathrm{h}$ . After changing the drill bit, th e drill string was reassembled and the subsea camera deployed for the reentry of Hole U1555I. Th e FFF remained in position, and the bit reentered Hole U1555I at $1605\,\mathrm{h}$ . After recovering the subsea camera, the center bit was dropped and the drill string advanced to $304.8~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Mud sweep s were used to clean the hole of debris.  

Cores 395C-U1555I-27R through 41R were cut from 304.8 to $376.5\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF with $30.9~\mathrm{m}$ of basal t recovered $(43\%)$ . Core recovery significantly decreased in Cores 38R–40R (358.3–372.7 m DSF ) with only $10\%$ of the basalt section retrieved. After reaching $376.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF ( $\mathrm{200\;m}$ into basement), coring concluded on 22 June.  

A total of $40\;\mathrm{RCB}$ cores were recovered from Hole U1555I with $48\%$ core recovery $77\%$ sedimen t recovery and $45\%$ basalt recovery). Cores were collected over a $217.2\;\mathrm{m}$ long interval with 104.1 9 m recovered.  

Following coring operations, the borehole was prepared for downhole wireline logging operations. A high-viscosity mud sweep was used to clean the hole of debris. The drill bit was dropped at th e bottom of the hole, and the drill pipe was brought up to $75.6\:\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The triple combo logging too l string was assembled and deployed at $^{1720\,\mathrm{h}}$ on 22 June. The tool descended to the bottom of th e hole and began making its first pass up the hole. At $1755\,\mathrm{h},$ , the triple combo became stuck. Afte r several attempts to pull the tools free using the Schlumberger logging line winch, the decision wa s made to lower the drill pipe over the tools to clear the obstruction. The drill pipe was lowered, an d the top of the triple combo was encountered at $183.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, $\sim\!7\;\mathrm{m}$ below the sediment/basemen t interface. The obstruction in the hole was at $225.5\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. The drill pipe was lowered until th e obstruction was pushed past the base of the tool string. At $1015\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 June, the tool string wa s free and the rig floor crew began pulling the tools up using the core winch line. At $1400\,\mathrm{h},$ the tool s were at the rig floor and were disassembled. Hole conditions prevented any other logging operations. The drill pipe was pulled from the hole. At $1700\ \mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , the pipe cleared the seafloor, and i t cleared the rotary table at $2015\,\mathrm{h}$ . The vessel was secured for transit to Site U1554, and the thrusters were raised at $2036\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1555I and Site U1555.  

# 4.2.3. Principal results  

The IODP technical staff processed all cores and samples in the laboratories, following the measurement and sampling plan constructed by the shore-based Co-Chief Scientists and scienc e party. Data interpretation, core description, and biostratigraphic analyses will take place postcruise.  

Sediment cores from Hole U1555H (Cores 395C-U1555H-1H through 19X; 0–179.17 m cor e depth below seafloor, Method A [CSF-A]) were run through the whole-round (WR) physical properties tracks, which include magnetic susceptibility (MS), gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, and natural gamma radiation (NGR) measurements. WR core sections nea r the sediment/basement interface were imaged using the X-Ray Imager (XRI). The split sectio n halves were imaged, measured for point MS and color reflectance, and scanned for magneti c remanence using the superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM). Thermal conductivity measurements and moisture and density (MAD) samples were collected at a resolution of one pe r core.  

Samples were collected on the catwalk for shipboard and shore-based interstitial water (IW), gas, microbiology, and micropaleontology analyses. Headspace gas samples for shipboard hydrocarbon safety analysis and postcruise research were collected from every core, and the resolutio n increased to two samples per core ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{m}$ above the sediment/basement interface. IW samples, $^{5-}$ $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ in length, were collected from each core, and three samples per core were collected in th e ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{m}$ above the sediment/basement interface. Microbiology samples were extracted using a sterile syringe, with $4\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment frozen in the syringe and $1\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment added to a glyco l solution and flash frozen using liquid nitrogen. Microbiology samples were paired with IW samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and carbonate samples were taken from the IW squeeze cake sediment residues. Additional carbonate samples were collected beginning ${\sim}30~\mathrm{~m~}$ above th e sediment/basement interface.  

RCB Cores 395C-U1555I-2R through 41R (159.3–374.4 m CSF-A) were run through the W R tracks to collect the same physical properties measurements as for Hole U1555H, with the exception of $P$ -wave velocity, which was not recorded because the space between the liner and the cor e for RCB cores prevents meaningful measurements. The split section halves were imaged; measured for point MS, color reflectance, thermal conductivity, and $P$ -wave velocity using the caliper; and scanned using the SRM. Section halves from Cores 2R–4R (159.3–185.39 m CSF-A) wer e imaged using the XRI. Each basalt core section was scanned using the handheld pXRF device. Sediment Cores 2R–4R were sampled for micropaleontology. WR samples of basalt for postcruis e microbiology studies were collected immediately after the core was received from the rig floor at  a resolution of one sample per ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Samples for inductively coupled plasma–atomic emissio n spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and thin sections were selected by the shore-based petrologists usin g core photos, also at ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{m}$ resolution.  

The split core images of the basalt sections and pXRF data were sent to science party members o n shore. Postcruise analysis of samples obtained from Expedition 384 Hole U1555G showed a downhole trend in the chemical composition of the basalts. The Expedition 395C shipboard pXRF dat a were compared to the shore-based inductively coupled plasma–mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) dat a to see if the trend could be reproduced on board the ship and to determine if the basement corin g depth needed to be extended past the $130\,\mathrm{m}$ initial plan. The pXRF data did show the same trend s as the ICP-MS data and allowed the science party to determine what depth was required for coring.  

Sediments at Site U1555 are clay to silt. Cores 395C-U1555H-1H through 2H (0–15 m CSF-A ) alternate between brown and gray clay and silt and contain dropstones. From 15 to $176.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSFA, sediment ranges from gray to dark gray (Figure F4A). Sponge spicules and foraminifers are visible in the split core sections. Coring disturbance varies, with some core tops heavily disturbed b y heave of the ship (Figure F5D). The recovered basalts display varying degrees of alteration including calcite veins, infilled vesicles, and staining (Figure F6A). Glass rinds are observed on some o f the core pieces. The formation changes at the very base of the hole ( ${\sim}374\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) to vesicula r basalt.  

Physical properties of the cores primarily reflect changes in the lithologic composition. MS an d NGR values differ greatly between sedimentary and igneous rocks (Figure F7). MS of the sedimentary section $\mathrm{(0{-}178\;m\,C S F{-}A)}$ ) ranges 8–485 instrument units (IU) with an average value of 237 IU. Basalt cores (178–375 m CSF-A) have much higher MS values, up to 2600 IU. NGR values in th e sediments average 12 counts/s, whereas the basalts have an average NGR value of 3 counts/s. Porosity of the sediments averages $75\%$ , with values decreasing from $82\%$ at the top of the hole t o $75\%$ near the base of the section. The deepest sample, obtained from Core 395C-U1555H-20X, ha s a porosity of $62\%$ . Red-green-blue (RGB) color and color reflectance does not vary greatly becaus e the cores are relatively homogeneous in color. $P$ -wave velocity increases downhole to the sediment/basement interface. $P$ -wave caliper measurements on basalts average $5300\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ .  

Downhole measurements at Site U1555 consisted of wireline logging and in situ temperature. Formation temperature measurements increase linearly from $8.3^{\circ}C$ ( $33.5~\mathrm{m}$ DSF) to $18.4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ( $\mathrm{^{119~m}}$ DSF) in Hole U1555H. Despite the difficulties with the downhole logging, the triple combo collected data on the way downhole and over the lowermost ${\sim}180~\mathrm{m}$ of the hole during its first an d only pass uphole prior to becoming stuck.

Core sections were run through the SRM, which measured natural remanent magnetizatio n (NRM) before and after alternating field (AF) demagnetization. Sediment cores were demagnetized up to $35~\mathrm{mT}$ at $1\,\mathrm{cm}$ spacing, and basalt cores were demagnetized up to $30\;\mathrm{mT}$ at $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ spacing. Both NRM and MS obtained by point measurement on section halves show a cyclicit y between 100 and $170\,\textrm{m}$ . The magnetic inclination displays strong changes in polarity, whic h allowed for the identification of 11 normal and 10 reversed magnetic polarities. The magnetostratigraphy was correlated to the geologic timescale, allowing us to locate the base of the Matuyam a $(2.595\,\mathrm{Ma})$ at ${\sim}172.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Most of the basalts show normal polarity and are not fully demagnetized at $30~\mathrm{mT}$ . Measurements on the basalts show two behaviors, with some displaying ove r $80\%$ magnetization loss before $25~\mathrm{mT}$ (soft magnetic component) and others showing no significant loss of magnetization at $25\;\mathrm{mT}$ (hard magnetic component) that correlates with the point M S range.

Hydrocarbon concentrations in gas samples and sediment and pore water geochemistry wer e measured in the chemistry laboratory. Methane concentrations are low throughout the sedimentary section, with an average of 1.9 parts per million by volume (ppmv). Methane peaks at 3.1 4 ppmv at $103\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ . The average calcium carbonate and total organic carbon (TOC) content o f the sediments in Hole U1555H is 11.0 and $0.3\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , respectively. Neither profile varies significantl y downhole. Pore water alkalinity and calcium concentration slightly increase downhole. Ammonium and sulfate display opposing trends with ammonium initially increasing downhole befor e decreasing near the sediment/basement interface. Sulfate decreases downhole but increase s within ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of the basement. Dissolved B, $\mathrm{Mg}$ , and K concentrations decrease downhole, whereas Li, Si, and Sr increase downhole.  

# 4.3. Site U1554  

# 4.3.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1554 (proposed Site REYK-6A of Expedition 395) is located in the North Atlantic Ocea n along the Reykjanes Ridge south of Iceland and on the Björn drift. Site U1554 is located on Seismi c Line JC50-1 (CMP 41740) near the intersection with Line JC50-C3 (CMP 1005), both obtained i n 2010 during RRS James Cook Cruise JC50 (Parnell-Turner et al., 2017). Site U1554 is located o n

VST-2b with an estimated basement age of $12.7\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . Another target for Site U1554 is to obtain  a continuous sedimentary record of the Björn drift, which will offer millennial-scale climat e records. The sedimentation rate of this drift can serve as a proxy for deepwater current strength, providing information on oceanic gateways and their potential ties to mantle plume pulses.  

Cores and data from this site will address all three of the primary science objectives: (1) crusta l accretion and mantle behavior; (2) ocean circulation, gateways, and sedimentation; and (3) timedependent hydrothermal alteration of oceanic crust.  

The operational objectives for this site were to core the sedimentary section using the APC an d XCB coring systems to the sediment/basement interface, install a reentry system with casing an d use the RCB system to core ${\sim}130\;\mathrm{m}$ into the basement, and use downhole wireline tools to log th e borehole.  

Operations at Site U1554 first occurred in July 2020 during Expedition 384 (Blum et al., 2020). Holes U1554A–U1554D ranged in depth from 23.5 to $76.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The recovered cores were use d to create a stratigraphic splice of the section. Paleomagnetic data from these cores were used t o test and resolve issues with the Icefield tools.  

# 4.3.2. Operations  

# 4.3.2.1. Hole U1554E  

Following a $54\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1555, the vessel arrived at Site U1554 early on 24 June 2021. The ship’s thrusters were lowered at $0124\;\mathrm{h},$ and the vessel switched to DP mode at $0136\,\mathrm{h}$ . Th e APC/XCB BHA and drill string were made up and run to the seafloor $(1870\,\mathrm{mbsl})$ . At $0754\,\mathrm{h}$ , Hol e U1554E $\!\!\{60^{\circ}7.5235^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{:}}$ , $26^{\circ}42.1324^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ was spudded and drilled without recovery to $66.3~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Coring during Expedition 384 recovered three copies of the uppermost ${\sim}75\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF, and corin g this interval was not required for safety monitoring. Coring using the APC system progresse d from 66.3 to $218.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF (Cores 395C-U1554E-2H through 17H) with $157.92\mathrm{~m~}$ of sedimen t recovered $(104\%)$ . While taking Core 17H, the core barrel could not be pulled out of the sedimen t using the core winch line, marking APC refusal. The barrel was drilled over using the drill string t o free the core.  

Formation temperature measurements using the APCT-3 tool were collected on Cores 395CU1554E-2H, 5H, 8H, and 11H. All APC cores were oriented and collected using nonmagnetic cor e barrels.  

The XCB system was deployed following Core 395C-U1554E-17H. Cores 18X–62X (218.3–647. 7 m DSF) were collected with $383.15\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered $(89\%)$ . The basement was encountered a t ${\sim}647\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF while drilling Core 62X; the core contained $^{1\,}\mathbf{m}$ of basalt interlayered with carbonat e sediment. The final depth of Hole U1554E was $647.7\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. A total of 61 cores were collecte d from Hole U1554E, with $541.07~\mathrm{m}$ of core collected over a $581.4\;\mathrm{m}$ interval $93\%$ recovery).  

Following coring operations, the hole was cleaned and displaced with heavy mud and the dril l string was pulled up to $72.8~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The triple combo logging tool string was made up and run i n the hole at $2100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 June. The tool string was able to descend to the base of the hole ${\sim}647\mathrm{~m}$ DSF), and the triple combo made two passes of the borehole. The first attempt to pull the tripl e combo through the bit and into the drill pipe occurred at $0115~\mathrm{h}$ on 28 June. The lockable floa t valve (LFV) at the bit had closed, preventing the tool string from reentering the pipe. After severa l hours of pumping seawater and rotating the drill string, the triple combo was pulled past the LFV, and the tools reached the surface at $0845\,\mathrm{h}$ . The Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic string wa s assembled and deployed at $1120~\mathrm{h}$ . A go-devil was attached to the top of the tool string to loc k open the LFV. After two passes of the borehole, the FMS-sonic was unable to pass through th e LFV and reenter the pipe. After additional pumping, the tools were successfully recovered, and th e FMS-sonic tool string reached the rig floor at $2055~\mathrm{h}$ . Based on the caliper results from the tripl e combo, which showed that the borehole was washed out to $>\!14$ inch diameter for the majority o f the hole, the decision was made to not run the Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI). Following loggin g operations, the drill string was pulled out of the hole, with the bit clearing the seafloor at $2210\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 28 June. At $0245\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 June the bit cleared the rotary table, ending the hole.  

# 4.3.2.2. Hole U1554F  

The ship was positioned over the Hole U1554F coordinates ( $60^{\circ}7.5136^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $26^{\circ}42.1140^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ) ${\sim}25\mathrm{~m~}$ southeast of Hole U1554E, and the rig floor crew began assembling the casing and reentry syste m (Figure F8). The mud skirt of the reentry system was moved over the moonpool, and the hydrauli c release tool (HRT) was made up and racked in the derrick. A $602.3\,\mathrm{m}$ long casing string, compose d of 52 joints of $10\%$ inch casing, was assembled. The HRT running tool was attached to the casin g and lowered to the mud skirt. The HRT running tool was then detached and put back into th e derrick. The mud motor, underreamer, and bit were assembled and tested. The first mud moto r rotated too freely and was replaced with a second mud motor. After a successful test, the cre w made up the BHA with the HRT running tool assembly and the reentry cone. At $0638\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 Jun e 2021, the HRT reentry system was deployed through the moonpool. The casing and drill strin g were run to $1552\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ , and the subsea camera system was deployed to observe the casing operations. Hole U1554F was spudded at $1345\mathrm{~h~}$ at a water depth of $1870~\mathrm{mbsl}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and the casing wa s drilled in to $602\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{DSF}$ Once the casing and reentry system were in place, a go-devil was pumpe d down the pipe to activate the HRT running tool and release the drill string from the casing. Th e drill string, including the HRT running tool assembly, was pulled from the hole, with the bit clearing the seafloor at $1610\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 July. The rig floor crew broke down the HRT running tool assembly.

An RCB BHA with a $_{\mathrm{C-4~RCB}}$ bit and the drill pipe were made up and run to $1836.5\ \mathrm{mbsl}$ . Th e subsea camera, along with the CTD sonde, was run to the end of the drill string to observe the bi t reenter Hole U1554F. The bit entered Hole U1554F at $1057~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 July. The subsea camera wa s retrieved, and the drill string advanced to the base of the casing string $\mathrm{[602\,m}$ DSF). The center bi t was dropped into the RCB bit, and Hole U1554F was drilled without recovery to $620\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Tw o drilled intervals, 395C-U1554F-11 ( $0{-}606.3\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{m\,DSF}}$ ) and 21 $\mathrm{^{606.3-620\m\,DS}}$ F), were recorded fo r the hole. The center bit was retrieved, and an RCB core barrel was deployed. Cores 3R–5 R advanced from 620 to $649.1\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF with $19.86\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered $(68\%)$ . Core 5R contained th e sediment/basement interface at ${\sim}647\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. Cores 6R–20R advanced from 649.1 to $721.7\;\mathrm{m}$ DS F with $45.91\;\mathrm{m}$ of basalt recovered $(63\%)$ .  

Following Core 395C-U1554F-20R, the drill bit had reached 50 rotating hours. The drill string wa s pulled from the hole to change the drill bit, and the bit cleared the seafloor at $1840~\mathrm{h}$ and rotar y table at $2210\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 5 July. A new C-7 RCB drill bit was made up to the BHA. The drill string wa s assembled, and the subsea camera, along with the CTD sonde, was deployed for the reentry. Th e bit reentered Hole U1554F at $0405~\mathrm{h}$ on 6 July. The subsea camera was recovered, and the dril l string advanced to $721.7\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. RCB coring resumed from 721.7 to $779.9\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF with the recovery of Cores 21R–32R.  

A total of 30 cores were recovered from Hole U1554F over an interval of $159.9\;\mathrm{m}$ . Core recover y for this hole was $100.15\mathrm{~m~}(63\%)$ . Basement cores advanced at an average rate of $1.76\;\mathrm{m/h}$ .  

Following coring operations, the hole was conditioned for downhole wireline logging with a 50 bb l high-viscosity mud sweep. The drill pipe was pulled out of the hole, and the subsea camera wa s deployed to observe operations. The drill bit cleared the seafloor at $0643\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 July, and the shi p was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ to the northeast. A rotary shifting tool (RST) was run to release the drill bit an d allow the logging tools to exit the drill pipe. The bit was released at $0756\,\mathrm{h},$ and at $0955\,\mathrm{h}$ , the pip e reentered Hole U1554F. The subsea camera was recovered, and the drill string was deployed t o $589.2\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF (inside casing string). The triple combo logging tool string was made up and run fo r two passes of the borehole from $602\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{DSF}$ (base of casing string) to the bottom of the hole at 77 9 m DSF. At $2010\;\mathrm{h}_{1}$ the triple combo tool string reached the drill floor and was broken down. Th e FMS-sonic tool string was made up and run at $0410\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 July. After making two logging passes, the FMS-sonic tool string was recovered to the rig floor, disassembled, and laid out. The Ultrasonic Borehole Imager (UBI) tool string was then made up and deployed to the bottom of the hole. The UBI made two logging passes, taking $360^{\circ}$ images of the borehole wall. The UBI tool strin g was recovered and laid out at $1425\,\mathrm{h}$ . The drill pipe was pulled up from 588 to $69\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{DSF}$ in preparation of running the VSI from the base of the hole up through the casing string. However, fogg y conditions throughout the afternoon and evening inhibited visibility and prevented the start of th e protected species observation (PSO) protocols. At day break, visibility had worsened, and conditions were not forecasted to improve until evening. Because of the time already allocated to Sit e U1554, the decision was made to abandon the VSI logging run and begin operations at Site U1562. The drill pipe was pulled up and cleared the seafloor at $0755\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 July, ending Hole U1554F.  

The vessel returned to Hole U1554F on 21 July to complete the VSI logging operations. The shi p completed the $6.1\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit in DP mode from Site U1562 to Hole U1554F at $0730\,\mathrm{h}$ . The subse a camera was deployed, and the drill pipe was lowered to $1836\;\mathrm{mbsl}.$ . The drill pipe was positione d over the reentry cone and reentered Hole U1554F at $0930\,\mathrm{h}$ . The subsea camera was retrieved, an d pipe was run to $68.5~\mathrm{m}$ DSF (in casing string) in preparation for downhole logging with the VS I tool. At ${\sim}1030\,\mathrm{h}$ , fog had formed around the vessel and reduced visibility. The vessel waited on th e fog to clear, and at $1250\,\mathrm{h}$ , the VSI was deployed to the base of the casing string ( $602\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF), th e air guns were set in the water, and the PSO protocols were initiated. Nearly immediately, whale s were spotted in the exclusion zone, which delayed the start of the VSI operations. After $2~\mathrm{{h}}$ o f tracking whales in the vicinity of the vessel, foggy conditions reduced visibility, prohibiting th e continuation of the PSO watch. With the fog forecasted to worsen throughout the evening an d into the next day, the planned VSI operations were canceled at $1600\,\mathrm{h}$ in favor of coring at the nex t site. The VSI was pulled from the drill pipe, and the tool reached the rig floor at $1700~\mathrm{h}$ . Whil e retrieving the tool string, visibility briefly improved only to reveal that the whales had come close r to the ship. The drill pipe was pulled out of the hole, and the end of the pipe cleared the seafloor a t  

$1840~\mathrm{h}$ and the rig floor at $2210~\mathrm{h}$ . The rig floor was secured for transit, and the thrusters wer e raised. The vessel began the $39\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1563 at $2236\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1554F and Sit e U1554.  

# 4.3.3. Principal results  

Sediment cores obtained from Holes U1554E and U1554F (Cores 395C-U1554E-2H through 60 X $[66.3–645.23\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}]$ ] and 395C-U1554F-3R and 4R $[620.0{-}636.9\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF{-}A}]\rangle$ ) were run throug h the WR physical properties tracks, which include MS, GRA bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, an d NGR measurements (Figure F9). WR core sections near the sediment/basement interface (Core s 395C-U1554E-56X through 61X) were imaged using the XRI. The split section halves wer e imaged, measured for point MS and color reflectance, and scanned for magnetic remanence usin g the SRM. Thermal conductivity measurements and MAD samples were collected at a resolution o f one per core.  

Samples were collected on the catwalk and at the sample table for shipboard and shore-based IW, gas, microbiology, and micropaleontology analyses. Headspace gas samples for shipboard hydrocarbon safety analysis and postcruise research were collected every core, and the resolutio n increased to two samples per core ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ above the sediment/basement interface. Samples fo r postcruise biostratigraphy were collected from each core catcher, and additional split core sample s were collected from 500 to $645\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A at $3{-}4\;\mathrm{m}$ resolution. Catwalk sampling for IW analysi s and microbiology began at Core 395C-U1554E-31X ${\sim}350\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A). The overlying sedimentar y section will be sampled for IW water chemistry and microbiology during Expedition 395 when th e section is recored and a sailing science party is available to assist with the measurements. IW samples, $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ in length, were collected from each core below $350\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , and three IW sample s per core were collected in the ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{m}$ above the sediment/basement interface. Microbiology samples were extracted using a sterile syringe, with $4\;\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}$ of sediment frozen in the syringe and $1\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment added to a glycol solution and flash frozen using liquid nitrogen. Microbiology samples were paired with IW samples. XRD and carbonate samples were taken from the IW squeez e cake sediment residues. Additional carbonate samples were collected beginning ${\sim}30\;\mathrm{m}$ above th e sediment/basement interface.

Figure F9. Core recovery and selected physical properties and geochemistry, Site U1554. Core recovery: black $=$ recovery, white $=$ no recovery.  

RCB Cores 395C-U1554F-5R through 32R (639.4–778.8 m CSF-A) were run through the W R tracks to collect the same physical properties measurements as for Hole U1554E, with the exception of $P$ -wave velocity, which was not recorded because the space between the liner and the cor e for RCB cores prevents meaningful measurements. The split section halves were imaged; measured for point MS, color reflectance, thermal conductivity, and $P$ -wave velocity using the caliper; and scanned for magnetic remanence using the SRM. Section halves from Cores 395C-U1554F-3 R through 5R ( $620{-}642.4\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) were imaged using the XRI. Each basalt core section wa s scanned using the handheld pXRF device. WR samples of basalt for postcruise microbiology studies were collected immediately after the core was received from the rig floor at a resolution of on e sample per ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Samples for ICP-AES and thin sections were selected by the shore-base d petrologists using core photos, also at ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ resolution.  

The lithology of the sedimentary cores changes downhole, with terrigenous sediment dominatin g the majority of the section and transitions to biogenic carbonate at the base of the drift. Core s 395C-U1554E-2H through 14H contain clay and silt that alternate between dark gray, light gray, and light greenish gray intervals. These cores display mottling and bioturbation (Figure F4B). Cores 15H–55X are dark gray and do not display the color changes observed in the upper sectio n of the hole. These cores contain gastropod shells, some of which are pyritized. Foraminifers an d biogenic silica can be seen in the split core sections using a hand lens, and dropstones of varyin g composition are occasionally observed (Figure F4F). The XCB cores have prevalent biscuitin g from the coring process (Figure F5D).  

Core 395C-U1554E-56X records a lithology change to lighter material with soft-sediment deformation and erosional surfaces (Figure F4H). Cores 395C-U1554E-57X through 60X and 395CU1554F-3R contain sediments that alternate between light green and dark gray with varyin g amounts of calcium carbonate $(32\mathrm{-}54\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ and clay content (Figure F4D, F4G). Sharp, erosiona l contacts and burrows are observed in these cores. Core 395C-U1554E-61X transitions from th e dark gray material to a light green and white nannofossil chalk with higher carbonate content $\left(66-\right.$ $85\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ). Chalk was also recovered in Cores 395C-U1554F-4R and 5R (Figure F4E).  

The sediment/basement interface was recovered in Cores 395C-U1554E-62X and 395C-U1554F5R. The uppermost basement is composed of basalt alternating with carbonate beds. Cores 395CU1554F-6R through 10R consist of basalt that is interlayered with thin beds of carbonate. Th e basalt contains glass and shows varying degrees of alteration with several veins present (Figur e F6C). Some of the carbonate intervals contain brecciated basalt clasts (Figure F6E). Cores 395CU1554F-11R through 32R $(673.5{-}778.8\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ are composed of basalt that contains glass an d has varying degrees of alteration that includes calcite veins, infilled vesicles, and staining (Figur e F6B). The shore-based petrology group provided sampling intervals for ICP-AES measurement s and thin sections.  

Physical properties of the cores primarily reflect changes in lithology. MS and NGR show cycli c patterns from 66 to ${\sim}450\mathrm{\m\,CSF{-}A}$ . At ${\sim}450\mathrm{\m\,\,CSF{-}A}$ , the values of both properties decrease an d remain reduced to the base of the sediment section in Hole U1554E. MS values of the basalts i n Hole U1554F average $\mathord{\sim}200$ IU, with a peak value of over 2300 IU. NGR values of the basalts average ${\sim}3.5$ counts/s. RGB color shows the most variance between 66 and $200\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , and RG B and color reflectance increase from 520 to $646\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. The average porosity of samples collected between Cores 395C-U1554E-31X and 61X (344.4–645.23 m CSF-A) is $62\%$ .  

The collection of measurements downhole at Site U1554 was successful. Four formation temperature measurements from 75.8 to $161.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF linearly increase from $5.6^{\circ}$ to $8.3^{\circ}C$ . The tripl e combo logging tool collected good measurements of porosity, density, NGR, resistivity, and M S throughout the sediment and basement sections. The FMS-sonic collected resistivity images fo r the entire length of the cored section, and the UBI collected $360^{\circ}$ images of the basement.  

Core sections were run through the SRM, which measured NRM before and after AF demagnetization. Sediment cores were demagnetized up to 25 or $35\,\mathrm{mT}$ at $1{-}2.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ spacing, and basalt core s were demagnetized up to $25\;\mathrm{mT}$ at $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ spacing. The lower part of Hole U1554E shows a decreas e in both NRM and MS, which correlates well with the lithologic change. The magnetic inclinatio n displays strong changes in polarity. However, the presence of strong biscuiting and drillinginduced remanence in the XCB cores prevents the construction of a full magnetostratigraphy, which will be reconstructed postcruise with the integration of paleontological data. The basalt s from Hole U1554F are not demagnetized at $25~\mathrm{mT}$ and mainly show normal polarities, with fe w reversed polarities localized in correspondence to fractures.  

Hydrocarbon concentrations in gas samples and sediment and pore water geochemistry wer e measured in the chemistry laboratory. Methane concentrations increase from 3 ppmv at the top o f the hole to 11000 ppmv at $205~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. From 205 to $301\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , the values plateau befor e decreasing to 0 ppmv at the sediment/basement interface $(646\mathrm{\;m\;CSF-A})$ ). Pore water sulfate is les s than $2~\mathrm{mM}$ from 350 to $400\textrm{m}$ CSF-A and then linearly increases to $27~\mathrm{mM}$ at $646\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Alkalinity decreases from $12.5\;\mathrm{mM}$ at ${\sim}350~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to $2.3\;\mathrm{mM}$ at the base of Hole U1554E. Dissolved Ca, Mg, K, and Sr increase downhole, whereas B decreases downhole. Br and Si fluctuat e over the sampled interval. Li concentration peaks at $492.8\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A with a value of $41\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ . Mn ha s a local peak of $7.4~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at $510\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ and increases to $12.7~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at the base of Hole U1554E. Sulfate, phosphate, and ammonium were measured on the spectrophotometer. Ammonium an d phosphate decrease downhole, whereas sulfate increases downhole. Carbonate results from sediments in Hole U1554E show an increase in calcium carbonate at the base of the hole. Cores 395CU1554E-31X through 51X have an average calcium carbonate concentration of $5.4~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Belo w Core 51X ${\sim}550\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A), carbonate concentrations increase steadily to a maximum value of 8 5 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ at the base of the sedimentary section ( $646\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A). TOC values average $0.47\mathrm{\wt\%}$ an d show a slight increase downhole.  

# 4.4. Site U1562  

# 4.4.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1562 (proposed Site REYK-3B of Expedition 395) is located in the North Atlantic Ocea n along the Reykjanes Ridge south of Iceland. Site U1562 is located on Seismic Line JC50-1 (CM P 39920) near the intersection with Line JC50-C2 (CMP 685), both obtained in 2010 during RR S James Cook Cruise JC50 (Parnell-Turner et al., 2017). Site U1562 is located on VSR-3 with an estimated basement age of $13.9\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

Cores and data from this site will address two of the primary science objectives: (1) crustal accretion and mantle behavior and (2) time-dependent hydrothermal alteration of oceanic crust.  

The operational objectives for this site were to core the sedimentary section using the APC, halflength APC (HLAPC), and XCB systems to the sediment/basement interface; use the RCB syste m to core ${\sim}130\;\mathrm{m}$ into the basement; and use downhole wireline tools to log the borehole.  

# 4.4.2. Operations  

Site U1562 consisted of two holes, U1562A and U1562B, ranging in depth from 429.8 to $561.5~\mathrm{m}$ DSF.  

A total of 96 cores were recorded for Site U1562. They collected $484.12\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and basal t over a $583.2\;\mathrm{m}$ cored interval ( $83\%$ recovery).  

The APC system was used to collect 21 cores over a $192.0\:\mathrm{m}$ interval with $199.45\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered $(104\%)$ . The HLAPC system was deployed for 36 cores and recovered $173.8\mathrm{~m~}$ of sedimen t from a $169.2\;\mathrm{m}$ interval ( $103\%$ recovery). The XCB system was deployed over a $68.6~\mathrm{m}$ interval,  

and the 8 XCB cores recovered $37.79\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment and basalt $55\%$ recovery). The RCB syste m was deployed for 31 cores over a $153.4\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with $73.08\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered $(48\%)$ . Downhol e wireline logging operations using four logging tools took place in Hole U1562B.  

# The total time spent at Site U1562 was 10.45 days.  

# 4.4.2.1. Hole U1562A  

The vessel began the $6.1\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Hole U1554F to Site U1562 in DP mode on 10 July 2021. The crew continued to pull up the drill pipe following the completion of operations in Hol e U1554F during the transit. The end of the pipe cleared the rotary table at $1130\,\mathrm{h}$ . At $1306\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 0 July, the vessel arrived at Site U1562 and the APC/XCB BHA was made up. The drill pipe was ru n to 1996 mbsl to take the first APC core.  

Hole U1562A $60^{\circ}06.3030^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $26^{\circ}30.1245^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) is located $21\;\mathrm{m}$ west of the site coordinates and wa s spudded at $2115\,\mathrm{h}$ . Core 395C-U1562A-1H recovered the mudline and $2.08\;\mathrm{m}$ of core, establishin g a seafloor depth of 2003 mbsl. APC Cores 2H–21H advanced from 2.0 to $192.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Core 21 H experienced significant overpull and was drilled over with the drill string to release the core barrel. HLAPC core barrels were made up, and coring continued with Cores 22F–57F ( $192.0{-}361.2\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF) using $4.7\,\mathrm{m}$ long advances. HLAPC refusal was met at Core 57F, which also required the dril l string to drill over the core barrel to release it from the sediment. The XCB core barrels were mad e up, and coring continued with Cores 58X–64X (361.2–429.1 m DSF). After drilling Core 64X, th e XCB cutting shoe was severely damaged and slightly melted and the base of the core catcher contained basalt. Another core barrel was deployed, and Core 65X was advanced to ensure that the bi t had reached basement. The bit advanced $0.7\;\mathrm{m}$ over $1\,\mathrm{h}_{:}$ , and Core 65X contained $0.68\:\mathrm{m}$ of basalt, confirming a basement depth of $429.1\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The final depth of Hole U1562A was $429.8\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The drill string was pulled from the hole, with the bit reaching the seafloor at $1535~\mathrm{h}$ on 13 July. Hole U1562A ended when the bit reached the rotary table at $1935\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

All of the full-length APC cores were oriented, and formation temperature measurements usin g the APCT-3 tool were collected on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, and 13H. Samples for IW, microbiology, micropaleontology, and gas analyses were routinely collected on the catwalk.  

A total of $411.04\mathrm{~m~}$ of core was recovered over a $429.8\ \mathrm{m}$ interval $96\%$ recovery). The averag e recovery for piston cores was $104\%$ with the APC system and $103\%$ with the HLAPC system. Th e XCB system had an average recovery of $55\%$ .  

# 4.4.2.2. Hole U1562B  

Following the end of Hole U1562A, an RCB BHA with a $_{\mathrm{C-4~RCB}}$ bit was made up and the dril l string was lowered to the seafloor. The ship was offset $21\;\mathrm{m}$ east-southeast of Hole U1562A, nea r the site coordinates, and Hole U1562B $(60^{\circ}6.2993^{\prime}\mathrm{N};$ , $26^{\circ}30.1026^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ; water depth $=2003\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ ) wa s spudded at $0320\;\mathrm{h}$ on 14 July 2021 and advanced without coring to $408.1\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The center bi t was recovered, and an RCB core barrel was deployed. Cores 395C-U1562B-2R through 13 R advanced from 408.1 to $474.2\mathrm{~m~DSF},$ recovering $48.65\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment and basalt $55\%$ recovery). The sediment/basement interface was recovered in Core 4R at $429.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Coring rates sped u p from ${\sim}2~\mathrm{m/h}$ to over $7~\mathrm{m/h}$ while drilling Core 14R. The driller noted that there was a ${\sim}3\textrm{m}$ lon g interval that drilled extremely quickly. It was soon revealed that Core 14R recovered $0.6\,\mathrm{m}$ of chal k bracketed by basalt. Coring continued with Cores 15R–19R advancing from 479.2 to $500.7\;\mathrm{m}$ DS F with $47\%$ recovery. While drilling Core 19R, the rate of penetration (ROP) dropped to $1\ \mathrm{m/h}$ an d there was erratic torque on the bit. It was suspected that the drill bit was damaged, and the ri g floor crew began pulling the pipe out of the hole. An FFF was deployed at $0220~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 July t o allow for the reentry of Hole U1562B. The bit cleared the seafloor at $0312\,\mathrm{h}$ and the rotary table a t $0708\,\mathrm{h}$ . The bit was indeed damaged. A new C-7 RCB coring bit was made up to the BHA, and th e crew assembled the drill string. The subsea camera, along with the CTD sonde, was deployed a t $^{1130\,\mathrm{h}}$ to observe the reentry of Hole U1562B, which occurred at $1450\,\mathrm{h}$ . The subsea camera wa s retrieved, and the drill string advanced to $500.7\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. After cleaning the hole with a high-viscosity mud sweep, Cores 20R–28R advanced from 500.7 to $561.5\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. Coring operations concluded in Hole U1562B after coring $132.5\mathrm{~m~}$ into the basement. The final depth of Hole U1562 B was $561.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF.  

A total of $73.08\mathrm{~m~}$ of core was recovered over a $153.4~\mathrm{m}$ cored interval from Hole U1562B $48\%$ recovery), and 31 RCB cores were collected from this hole. The average ROP while coring th e basalt was $2.1\;\mathrm{m/h}$ .  

Following coring, the RST was run to release the bit into the bottom of the hole. The drill strin g was pulled up, and the end of the pipe was set at $89\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The triple combo logging tool strin g was made up and deployed at $1755~\mathrm{h}$ on 19 July. After completing two successful passes of th e entire hole, the tools were retrieved and reached the rig floor at $2310\,\mathrm{h}$ . After the triple combo too l string was laid out, the FMS-sonic was made up and deployed at $0100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 July. Following tw o passes that extended to the base of the hole, the FMS-sonic was pulled from the hole and reache d the rig floor at $0645\,\mathrm{h}$ . The next logging run used the VSI tool. The PSO protocols began at 073 0 $^{\mathrm{h,}}$ and the IODP technical staff ramped up the air guns starting at $0834\,\mathrm{h}$ . The VSI was lowered t o the base of the hole, and a total of four depth stations (420.5, 426, 459.9, and $556.6~\mathrm{m}$ DSF) wer e completed: two in the basement section, one at the sediment/basement interface, and one in th e lowermost sediment. The VSI could not be successfully run throughout the sedimentary sectio n because of the wide diameter $_{>16}$ inch) of the borehole. Following the VSI run, the air guns wer e put away, and the tool reached the rig floor at $1320\;\mathrm{h}$ . The final logging run, using the UBI tool, began at $1445\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . The UBI made two passes of the basement section, acquiring $360^{\circ}$ borehol e images. The UBI was recovered at the rig floor at $2130\,\mathrm{h}$ . The drill string was pulled out of the hol e to ${\sim}1489~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , and the ship began the transit in DP mode to Hole U1554F at $2355~\mathrm{h}$ on $20\;\mathrm{July},$ ending Site U1562.

SRM. Thermal conductivity measurements and MAD samples were collected at a resolution o f one per core.  

Samples were collected on the catwalk and at the sample table for shipboard and shore-based IW, gas, microbiology, and micropaleontology analyses. Headspace gas samples for shipboard hydrocarbon safety analysis and postcruise research were collected every core, and the resolutio n increased to two samples per core ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ above the sediment/basement interface. Samples fo r postcruise biostratigraphy were collected from each core catcher. IW samples, $10~\mathrm{cm}$ in length, were collected from each core, and three IW samples per core were collected in the ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{m}$ abov e the sediment/basement interface. Microbiology samples were extracted using a sterile syringe, with $4\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment frozen in the syringe and $1\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment added to a glycol solution an d flash frozen using liquid nitrogen. Microbiology samples were paired with IW samples. XRD an d carbonate samples were taken from the IW squeeze cake sediment residues. Additional carbonat e samples were collected beginning ${\sim}30\;\mathrm{m}$ above the sediment/basement interface.  

RCB cores from Hole U1562B were run through the WR tracks to collect the same physical properties measurements as for Hole U1562A, with the exception of $P$ -wave velocity, which was no t recorded because the space between the liner and the core for RCB cores prevents meaningfu l measurements. The split section halves were imaged; measured for point MS, color reflectance, thermal conductivity, and $P$ -wave velocity using the caliper; and scanned using the SRM. Sectio n halves from Cores 395C-U1562B-3R and 4R were imaged using the XRI. Each basalt core sectio n was scanned using the handheld pXRF device. WR samples of basalt for postcruise microbiolog y studies were collected immediately after the core was received from the rig floor at a resolution o f one sample per ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{m}$ . Samples for ICP-AES and thin sections were selected by the shore-base d petrologists using core photos, also at ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ resolution.  

Sediments in the uppermost ${\sim}250~\mathrm{m}$ (Cores 395C-U1562A-1H through 34F) are primarily composed of clay and silt with fine sand beds and dropstones interspersed through the section. Th e cores are mostly gray to dark gray but contain brown and greenish gray intervals as well. A transition from the overlying gray clay and silt to a lighter gray clay occurs in Core 35F (253.1–257.9  m CSF-A). This core contains notable soft-sediment deformation. Cores 36F–54F $257.8{-}347.2\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) range from light gray to dark gray clay with bioturbation and discrete intervals of soft-sediment deformation. Core 55F (347.1–356.06 m CSF-A) captures a transition between the overlyin g clays and silts to a finer grained, carbonate-rich greenish gray sediment with abundant bioturbation that continues to Core 64X. Cores 58X and 60X contain large $({\sim}5~\mathrm{cm})$ basalt clasts (Figur e F11E). The lithology in Core 64X (419.4–427.82 m CSF-A) transitions from greenish gray, bioturbated, fine-grained sediment to a white carbonate ooze. Section 64X-CC and Core 65X (427.4– $429.8\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) are composed of dark gray, vesicular to avesicular basalt that contains white t o green veins and infilled vesicles (Figure F11D). The XCB cores are fractured and disturbed.  

Core 395C-U1562B-2R through Section 4R-1 (408.1–428.57 m CSF-A) contain greenish gray, fine-grained, carbonate-rich, bioturbated sediment. The interval from Section 4R-2 through Cor e 32R (428.57–559.6 m CSF-A) is composed of dark gray to brown basalt (Figure F6D). The basal t displays varying degrees of alteration with infilled vesicles, calcite veins, and staining (Figur e F11A, F11B). Glass rinds are observed on many of the core pieces. Section 14R-2 (475.54–476.2  m CSF-A) contains a $_{0.6\;\mathrm{m}}$ long interval of nannofossil ooze bracketed by basalt flows, and intercalated carbonate beds are found in Cores 5R, 6R, and 15R–19R.  

Physical properties of the cores primarily reflect changes in lithology. Porosity of the sediment s linearly decreases downhole from ${\sim}80\%$ at the top of the section to $63\%$ above the sediment/basement interface ( $\mathrm{427~m}$ CSF-A). MS and color reflectance values in the sediments align with colo r changes in the cores, potentially indicating changes in carbonate content. MS values of the uppermost basalt cores (395C-U1562B-4R and 5R) are higher than the rest of the cored section at Sit e U1562. The average MS value of basalts in these two cores is ${\sim}400$ IU with a maximum value o f 1535 IU. The average MS value for Cores 6R–32R is 124 IU. The average $P$ -wave velocity of th e basalts is $5400\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ .  

The downhole measurements program at Site U1562 consisted of downhole wireline logging an d formation temperature measurements. All four downhole wireline logging tool runs were successful. The FMS-sonic and UBI recorded images of the borehole wall. Four formation temperatur e measurements from 30.5 to $116\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF show a linear increase with depth from $4.3^{\circ}$ to $7.3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

Core sections were run through the SRM, which measured NRM before and after AF demagnetization. The cores were demagnetized up to $25\;\mathrm{mT}$ at $2.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution for APC and HLAPC core s and $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution for XCB cores. Both NRM and MS show a clear cyclicity between 100 and 30 0 m in Hole U1562A. The magnetic inclination shows clear intervals of normal and reversed polarity, which will be used postcruise to establish the magnetostratigraphy for the site. The basalt s from Hole U1562B are usually not demagnetized at $25~\mathrm{mT}$ and mainly show a normal polarity.  

Chemistry measurements were made on gas, pore water, and sediment samples. Hydrocarbo n gases in Hole U1562A are present in very low concentrations. Methane peaks at 2.61 ppmv a t ${\sim}223\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Sediments from the uppermost $150~\mathrm{m}$ of Hole U1562A contain little carbonate, with values ranging $0.04{-}33\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . At 150–300 m CSF-A, carbonate values range $4{-}65\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . Belo w $300\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, values are consistently elevated with a maximum of $78~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . TOC has an averag e value of $0.59\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ with a maximum concentration of $5.23\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ at $413\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ . Pore water alkalinity increases downhole from ${\sim}2.5\;\mathrm{mM}$ at the top of the hole to a maximum value of $7.5\;\mathrm{mM}$ at 22 3 m CSF-A. Below $223\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , alkalinity decreases to ${\sim}3.5~\mathrm{mM}$ above the sediment/basemen t interface $({\sim}427\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ ). Ammonium increases from $33~\mathrm{mM}$ at the top of Hole U1562A to  a maximum value of $635\;\mathrm{mM}$ at $100\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ and then decreases to $263~\mathrm{mM}$ at the bottom of th e hole. Sulfate decreases from 29 to $19\;\mathrm{mM}$ between 0 and $270~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A before increasing to th e base of the hole. Boron decreases downhole, whereas Si and $\scriptstyle\mathrm{Sr}$ increase with depth. Bromine, Ca, Mg all show an initial decrease with depth followed by an increase to the sediment/basemen t interface.  

# 4.5. Site U1563  

# 4.5.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1563 (proposed Site REYK-11A of Expedition 395) is located in the North Atlantic Ocea n along the Reykjanes Ridge south of Iceland. Site U1563 is located at the intersection of Seismi c Lines JC50-1 (CMP 53393) and JC50-C6 (CMP 888), obtained in 2010 during RRS James Cook Cruise JC50 (Parnell-Turner et al., 2017). Site U1563 is located on VSR-2a with an estimated basement age of $5.2\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . Cores and data from this site will address two of the primary science objectives: (1) crustal accretion and mantle behavior and (2) time-dependent hydrothermal alteration o f oceanic crust.

The operational objectives for this site were to core the sedimentary section using the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems to the sediment/basement interface, use the RCB system to core $\mathord{\sim}130$ m into the basement, and use downhole wireline tools to log the borehole.  

# 4.5.2. Operations  

Site U1563 consisted of two holes, U1563A and U1563B, ranging in depth from 327.6 to $456.6~\mathrm{m}$ DSF.  

A total of 80 cores were recorded for Site U1563. They collected $397.36\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and basal t over a $482.8\;\mathrm{m}$ cored interval ( $79\%$ recovery).  

The APC system was used to collect 21 cores over a $197.4\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with $207.05\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered $(105\%)$ . The HLAPC system was deployed for 26 cores and recovered $122.35\mathrm{~m~}$ of sedimen t from a $122.2\:\mathrm{m}$ interval ( $100\%$ recovery). The XCB system was deployed over a $8.0\,\mathrm{m}$ interval, an d the 2 XCB cores recovered $5.58~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and basalt ( $70\%$ recovery). The RCB system wa s deployed for 31 cores over a $155.2\textrm{m}$ interval with $44.38\mathrm{~m~}$ of core recovered $(29\%)$ . Downhol e wireline logging operations using three logging tool strings took place in Hole U1563B.  

The total time spent at Site U1563 was 8.51 days.  

# 4.5.2.1. Hole U1563A  

The vessel completed the $39\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1562 on 22 July 2021. The thrusters were lowered at $0212\;\mathrm{h}_{:}$ , and the ship entered DP mode at $0235~\mathrm{h}$ , marking the start of Site U1563. Th e APC/XCB BHA was made up, and the drill string was deployed to 1415.7 mbsl. Hole U1563 A $(60^{\circ}11.9985^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $28^{\circ}00.0209^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) was spudded at $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ . Core 395C-U1563A-1H recovered $7.4\;\mathrm{m}$ o f sediment, placing the seafloor at 1417.8 mbsl. Cores 2H–16H advanced to $149.9\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF, with $105\%$ core recovery. During the collection of Core 16H, the core barrel became detached from the sinke r bars and GS overshot tool when the shear pin in the GS overshot tool evidently failed. The sinke r bars and GS overshot tool were recovered, the GS overshot tool was replaced, and the core barre l was retrieved. However, the APC piston rods had twisted while the core barrel was in the BHA, and the rods required replacement. Coring continued with Cores 17H–21H advancing from 149. 4 to $197.4~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. APC refusal was reached at Core 21H when the core barrel became stuck in th e sediment and required 130,000 lbs of overpull to release the barrel from the formation. Th e HLAPC system was deployed for Cores 22F–47F ( $197.4–319.6\ensuremath{\mathrm{~m~DS~}}$ F) and was switched out fo r the XCB coring system when the bit neared the estimated depth of the basement. Core 48 X $319.6{-}326.6\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{m\,D3}}$ SF) recovered the sediment/basement interface, and the basement was encountered at $326.4~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Core 49X was deployed to ensure that basement had in fact been reached. The core advanced $^{1\textrm{m}}$ to a final hole depth of $327.6\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF and recovered $0.42~\mathrm{m}$ of basalt. Following Core 49X, the drill string was pulled out of the hole. The bit cleared the seafloor at $0400\,\mathrm{h}$ and the rotary table at $0715\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 July, ending Hole U1563A.  

A total of $334.98\;\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered over a $327.6\;\mathrm{m}$ interval ( $102\%$ recovery).  

# 4.5.2.2. Hole U1563B  

The ship was offset $21\;\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1563A ${\sim}3\textrm{m}$ from the proposed site coordinates, and th e RCB BHA was made up with a C-7 RCB drill bit. The drill string was made up and deployed t o $1403\,\mathrm{\mbsl}$ . The center bit was lowered into the RCB bit, and Hole U1563B $\left(60^{\circ}11.9946^{\prime}\mathrm{N},\right.$ $27^{\circ}59.9996^{\prime}\mathrm{W}_{J}$ ) was spudded at $1605\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 July 2021.  

Hole U1563B was advanced without coring to $301.4\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. The center bit was retrieved, an d Cores 395C-U1563B-2R through 5R advanced from 301.4 to $325.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. The sediment/basement interface was encountered at ${\sim}315\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF but was not preserved in Core 3R. While drillin g Core 5R, winds had increased to sustained speeds of $35\ \mathrm{kt}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , gusting up to $45\ \mathrm{kt}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , which create d hazardous conditions on the rig floor. The vessel began waiting on weather at $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 July. I t was noted that there was an unusual noise emanating from a transformer for three of the thrusters. The vessel resumed operations at $1330\,\mathrm{h}$ once the wind speeds had died down. Core 5R was recovered, and the drill string was pulled up to $90\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF to work on the thrusters. The three affecte d thrusters were shut down, and it was discovered that the insulation around a transformer cabl e was loose. Once this was repaired, the ship was able to resume operations at $1845\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 July. Th e crew deployed a wash barrel into the BHA and lowered the bit to $325.8\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{DSF}$ . After a high-viscosity mud sweep to clean the hole, the wash barrel was retrieved and a core barrel was deployed fo r Core 6R. Coring continued with Cores 6R–32R advancing from 325.8 to $456.6~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Followin g Cores 25R–32R, the crew cleaned the hole with high-viscosity mud because of deteriorating hol e conditions. After Core 32R was recovered, the drill pipe became stuck in the hole and unable t o rotate, circulate fluid, or move. Coring operations were terminated, and after ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{h},$ the pipe wa s freed and the drill string was pulled up to $363.9\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The hole was prepared for downhole logging operations with another high-viscosity mud sweep. The RST was deployed to release the dril l bit and allow logging tools to exit the drill pipe. The RCB drill bit was released in the hole at 232 5 h on 28 July.  

A total of $44.38~\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered over a $155.2\;\mathrm{m}$ cored interval $29\%$ recovery). Coring o f the basalts advanced at an average ROP of $3.6\;\mathrm{m/h}$ .  

The drill pipe was pulled up to $87.6~\mathrm{m}$ DSF in preparation for downhole logging operations. Th e triple combo tool string was assembled and deployed at $0410~\mathrm{h}$ on 29 July. The tool string mad e two passes of the borehole, reaching $313.9\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF. At $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ , the triple combo reached the rig floo r and was broken down. The second logging tool run was the VSI. At $1045~\mathrm{h}_{:}$ , the VSI tool wa s deployed and the PSO protocols began. Whales were sighted in the area, delaying the start of operations. Once it was deemed safe to fire the air guns, the VSI was lowered to three stations: 283.9, 292.9, and $308.9\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{DSF}.$ . Only the bottom two stations recorded successful measurements. At 165 2 h, the PSO watch ended and the tool was pulled out of the hole, reaching the rig floor at $1810~\mathrm{h}$ After the VSI tool was broken down, the FMS-sonic tool string was assembled and deployed a t $1935\mathrm{~h~}$ . The FMS-sonic tool descended to $311.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF and recorded resistivity images of th e borehole. The tools were pulled up to the rig floor at $2325\ \mathrm{h};$ and the day ended while breakin g down the FMS-sonic tool string. The crew pulled the drill pipe up, and the end of the pipe cleared the seafloor at $0105\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 June and the rotary table at $0513\,\mathrm{h}$ . The rig floor was secured, and th e thrusters were raised. The vessel began the $144\;\mathrm{nmi}$ sea passage to Site U1564 at $0518\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 July.  

# 4.5.3. Principal results  

Sediment cores obtained from Holes U1563A (Cores 395C-U1563A-1H through 48X; 0–324.7  m CSF-A) were run through the WR physical properties tracks, which include MS, GRA bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, and NGR measurements (Figure F12). The split section halves were imaged, measured for point MS and color reflectance, and scanned for magnetic remanence using th e SRM. Thermal conductivity measurements and MAD samples were collected at a resolution o f one per core.  

Samples were collected on the catwalk and at the sample table for shipboard and shore-based IW, gas, microbiology, and micropaleontology analyses. Headspace gas samples for shipboard hydrocarbon safety analysis and postcruise research were collected every core, and the resolutio n increased to two samples per core ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ above the sediment/basement interface. Samples fo r postcruise biostratigraphy were collected from each core catcher. IW samples, $10~\mathrm{cm}$ in length, were collected from each core, and three IW samples per core were collected in the ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{m}$ abov e the sediment/basement interface. Microbiology samples were extracted using a sterile syringe, with $4\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment frozen in the syringe and $1\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment added to a glycol solution an d flash frozen using liquid nitrogen. Microbiology samples were paired with IW samples. XRD an d carbonate samples were taken from the IW squeeze cake sediment residues. Additional carbonat e samples were collected beginning ${\sim}30\;\mathrm{m}$ above the sediment/basement interface.  

RCB cores from Hole U1563B were run through the WR tracks to collect the same physical properties measurements as for Hole U1563A, with the exception of $P$ -wave velocity, which was no t recorded because the space between the liner and the core for RCB cores prevents meaningfu l measurements. The split section halves were imaged; measured for point MS, color reflectance, thermal conductivity, and $P$ -wave velocity using the caliper; and scanned using the SRM. Eac h basalt core section was scanned using the handheld pXRF device. WR samples of basalt for postcruise microbiology studies were collected immediately after the core was received from the ri g floor at a resolution of one sample per ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Samples for ICP-AES and thin sections wer e selected by the shore-based petrologists using core photos, also at ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ resolution.  

The primary lithologies in Hole U1563A are clay and silt with occasional fine sand beds and dropstones. Core 395C-U1563A-1H alternates between brown and gray layers, and Cores 2H–44 F $(7.2{-}305.44\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ ) show light gray to dark gray banding. Cores 13H, 17H, and 19H each contain a ${\sim}20~\mathrm{cm}$ thick coarse sand bed (Figure F4I). Core 40F and the tops of Cores 41F and 43 F contain brown, unconsolidated fine sand (Figure F4C). In Core 45F $(305.5{-}310.34\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ ), th e lithology transitions to a light gray silt and clay with gray and green mottling. This extends dow n to Core 47F $314.9–319.87\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ where there is a sharp transition to yellow to white chalk. Core 47F contains three large $\leftrightsquigarrow\sin$ diameter) basalt clasts. The calcareous ooze extends to th e basalt basement, which is found in Section 48X-CC. Core 49X is dark gray basalt with intercalate d carbonate beds.  

Cores from Hole U1563B are primarily composed of basalt. Core 395C-U1563B-2R (301.4–301.9 4 m CSF-A) contains $0.54\;\mathrm{m}$ of carbonate ooze with basalt clasts. The sediment/basement interfac e in this hole was at ${\sim}315\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, nearly $11\textrm{m}$ shallower than in Hole U1563A. Cores 3R–32 R $(311.1{-}452.91\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ are composed of dark gray basalt with vesicles and calcite veins. Th e basalts have some brown staining and contain infilled vesicles. Many of the basalt cores contai n thin intercalated carbonate beds (Figure F11C). Cores 15R and 17R contain carbonate pieces wit h brecciated clasts of basalt.  

Physical properties of the cores reflect changes in their composition. NGR values of the sediment s range 5–32 counts/s from 0 to $212\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A, with the exception of a maximum peak of 4 6 counts/s at 136.7 m CSF-A. Below $212~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, NGR values decrease from ${\sim}10$ to 5 counts/s a t the base of the sedimentary section. NGR values of the basalt cores from Hole U1563B are low, with an average of 2 counts/s. MS values of the sediments range 15–541 IU in the uppermost 28 0 m of the section. Below $280\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A, MS values are consistently below $100\ \mathrm{IU}$ to the sediment/basement interface. The average MS value of the basalt cores is 177 IU. MS peaks occur i n Cores 395C-U1563B-15R, 17R, and 24R. The average $P$ -wave velocity of the basalts is $5500\ \mathrm{m/s}$ . Sediment porosity decreases from $81\%$ at the top of Hole U1563A to $69\%$ at $323\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.

The downhole measurements program at Site U1563 consisted of downhole wireline logging an d formation temperature measurements. The triple combo, FMS-sonic, and VSI tool strings were al l run successfully. Four formation temperature measurements from 35.9 to $121.4\textrm{m}$ DSF show  a linear increase with depth from $5.3^{\circ}$ to $8.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

Core sections were run through the SRM, which measured NRM before and after AF demagnetization. Cores were demagnetized up to $25~\mathrm{mT}$ at $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ resolution for APC, HLAPC, and XC B cores and $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ resolution for RCB cores. The NRM shows significant variations with depth, wit h lower intensities in the lowermost part of Hole U1563A, corresponding to the lithologic transition. The magnetic inclination shows clear intervals of normal and reversed polarity, which will be use d postcruise to establish the magnetostratigraphy for the site.  

Chemistry measurements were made on gas, pore water, and sediment samples. Methane value s in Hole U1563A range 0–2.15 ppmv. From 0 to $229\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , calcium carbonate values range $0.4-$ $39\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ (average $=12\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ . Below $229\textrm{m}$ CSF-A, concentrations show a stepped increase wit h values between 238 and $276\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ averaging $46\:\mathrm{wt\%}$ and values between 285 and $324\;\mathrm{m}$ CSFA averaging $80\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ . The average TOC concentration of the section is $0.35~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Pore water wa s analyzed using titration, chromatography, ICP-AES, and spectrophotometry. Alkalinity increase s from $\sim\!3\:\mathrm{mM}$ at the top of Hole U1563A to a maximum value of $5.8\;\mathrm{mM}$ at $210\mathrm{\;m\;CSF-A}$ and the n decreases to $\sim\!2\:\mathrm{mM}$ at the base of the sediment section. Ammonium broadly increases downhol e from 7.3 to $565.9~\mathrm{mM}$ at $200\textrm{m}$ CSF-A. Below this depth, ammonium linearly decreases to 62. 7 $\mathbf{m}\mathbf{M}$ near the sediment/basement interface $324\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ ). Sulfate linearly decreases from 0 t o $105\mathrm{\;m\;CSF-A}$ , with values decreasing from 33 to $26\;\mathrm{mM}$ . Sulfate then fluctuates between 24.3 an d $28.7\;\mathrm{mM}$ from 105 to $266\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A before increasing to $33\;\mathrm{mM}$ at the base of the section. Lithiu m increases downhole, and Sr and Si initially increase downhole before decreasing to the sediment/basement interface. Magnesium and Ca display the opposite trend of decreasing downhol e and then increasing to the sediment/basement interface. Manganese decreases downhole, whereas B, Br, Na, and phosphate do not display any downhole trends.  

# 4.6. Site U1564  

# 4.6.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1564 (Proposed Site REYK-2A of Expedition 395) is located in the North Atlantic Ocea n near the Reykjanes Ridge south of Iceland. Site U1564 is located on Seismic Line JC50-1 (CM P 10710) near the intersection with Line JC50-C1 (CMP 1019), both obtained in 2010 during RR S James Cook Cruise JC50 (Parnell-Turner et al., 2017).  

Site U1564 is located on segmented crust that does not contain traces of V-shaped features, an d basalt samples will provide a record with which to compare samples from VST and VSR crust. Sit e U1564 is located on the Gardar drift, which will provide high-resolution, millennial-scale record s for paleoceanographic research. The sedimentation rate of this drift can serve as a proxy for deepwater current strength, providing information on oceanic gateways and their potential ties t o mantle plume pulses. The Gardar drift was cored at Site 983 during Leg 162, and a sedimentar y sequence was obtained back to $1.7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (early Pleistocene) (Jansen and Raymo, 1996). Samples fro m Site 983 have resulted in several publications that have documented the paleoclimate and oceanography of the North Atlantic Ocean (e.g., Barker et al., 2019). Cores at Site U1564 will extend thi s record back to the Oligocene epoch. The estimated basement age at Site U1564 is $32.4\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

Cores and data from this site will address all three of the primary science objectives: (1) crusta l accretion and mantle behavior; (2) ocean circulation, gateways, and sedimentation; and (3) timedependent hydrothermal alteration of oceanic crust.  

The planned operations at Site U1564 included coring a hole to ${\sim}650~\mathrm{m}$ followed by installing  a $600\,\mathrm{m}$ long casing string and reentry system. We did not have time to complete the planned casin g operations at Site U1564 during Expedition 395C because coring the basalt sections at the othe r sites took more time than anticipated and we lost time because of weather. Operations were scale d to the time available at the end of the expedition. The site was cored to $628.9\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF and the n logged with the triple combo and FMS-sonic logging tools to obtain preliminary data for Expedition 395.  

# 4.6.2. Operations  

Site U1564 consisted of three holes, U1564A–U1564C, ranging in depth from 9.5 to $628.9\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. A total of 79 cores were recorded for Site U1564. They collected $655.41\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over a 664. 6 m cored interval $99\%$ recovery).  

The APC system was used to collect 21 cores over a $197.4\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with $201.60\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered $(104\%)$ . The HLAPC system was deployed for 18 cores and recovered $87.77\textrm{m}$ of sedimen t from a $84.6~\mathrm{m}$ interval ( $104\%$ recovery). The XCB system was deployed over a $385.3\mathrm{~m~}$ interval, and the $40\,\mathrm{XCB}$ cores recovered $366.04\:\mathrm{m}$ of sediment $95\%$ recovery). Downhole wireline loggin g operations using the triple combo and FMS-sonic logging tools took place in Hole U1564C.  

The total time spent at Site U1564 was 5.29 days.  

# 4.6.2.1. Hole U1564A  

The vessel arrived at Site U1564 at $1748\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 July 2021. The thrusters were lowered, the shi p entered DP mode, and the drill string was made up with an APC/XCB BHA. The drill string wa s run to $2220.0\ \mathrm{mbsl}$ to spud Hole U1564A $(59^{\circ}51.0377^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $23^{\circ}16.0071^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ) ${\sim}20\mathrm{~m~}$ west of the proposed site coordinates. The exact site coordinates were to be reserved for future reentry syste m and casing installation during Expedition 395. Hole U1564A was initiated at $0245\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 July, an d Core 395C-U1564A-1H recovered a full core $\left(9.89\mathrm{~m}\right)$ , prohibiting the establishment of the seafloor depth.  

# 4.6.2.2. Hole U1564B  

The ship was offset $^{20\textrm{m}}$ to the east (directly over the proposed site coordinates), and Hol e U1564B $(59^{\circ}51.0372^{\prime}\mathrm{N};$ , $23^{\circ}15.9868^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ was spudded at $0342\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 31 July 2021. Core 395CU1564B-1H recovered $7.22~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment, placing the seafloor at 2207.9 mbsl. Coring continue d through Core 3H when the error in the ship’s offset was noted and operations in Hole U1564 B were terminated. The bit cleared the seafloor at $0630\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1564B.  

A total of $26.81\;\mathrm{m}$ of core was collected over a $26.2\;\mathrm{m}$ cored interval ( $102\%$ recovery).  

# 4.6.2.3. Hole U1564C  

The ship was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ back to the west over the Hole U1564A coordinates, and Hole U1564 C $(59^{\circ}51.0374^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{:}$ , $23^{\circ}16.0087^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ was spudded at $0707~\mathrm{h}$ on 31 July 2021. The seafloor depth wa s calculated at 2208.1 mbsl based on the recovery of Core 395C-U1564C-1H $(7.02\;\mathrm{m})$ . Coring continued with the APC system recovering Cores 2H–17H $(7.0{-}159.0\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF). Core 17H require d significant overpull (90,000 lbs) to release the core barrel from the sediment. Coring with the fulllength APC system was terminated, and the crew began making up the HLAPC barrels. Core s 18F–35F advanced from 159.0 to $243.6~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The overpull when retrieving Core 35F was ove r 80,000 lbs, and coring switched to the XCB system. Cores 36X–75X were collected to $628.9\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. Following Core 75X, the crew began pulling up the drill string in preparation for downhol e logging operations.  

The drill pipe was raised until the bit was at $80.6\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The triple combo logging tool string wa s made up and deployed at $0250\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 August. The triple combo descended to the bottom of th e hole (628.9 m DSF) and made two passes of the borehole. The tool was recovered at $0930~\mathrm{h}$ an d broken down. The FMS-sonic tool string was made up, deployed to the base of the hole, and mad e a single pass imaging the borehole wall. The FMS-sonic tool was brought up to the rig floor a t $1640\,\mathrm{h}$ and broken down. The downhole logging equipment was put away, and the logging tool s were moved to the helideck. The rig floor crew began pulling up the pipe, with the bit clearing th e seafloor at $1845\,\mathrm{h}$ . At $1920\,\mathrm{h}$ , four of the five thruster pods were raised and were secured at 223 6 h. The bit cleared the rig floor at $0100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 August, and the remaining thruster pod was raised.  

At $0106\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , the ship switched from DP to cruise mode, ending Site U1564. The ship began the 29 3 nmi transit to Reykjavík, Iceland.  

All APC cores were oriented using the Icefield tool. Formation temperature measurements wer e collected on Cores 395C-U1564C-4H, 7H, 10H, 13H, and 15H; however, the APCT-3 tool floode d during the Core 4H deployment, and no data were collected.  

A total of $618.71\;\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered from Hole U1564C ( $98\%$ recovery). A total of 17 AP C cores were collected over a $159.0\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with $164.90\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment recovered $(104\%)$ . Recovery with the HLAPC system was also $104\%$ , with $87.77\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered over $84.6\;\mathrm{m}$ . The XC B system was deployed for 40 cores and recovered $366.04\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment over a $385.3\mathrm{~m~}$ interva l ( $95\%$ recovery).  

# 4.6.3. Principal results  

With the anticipated number of cores and the short transit to port at the end of the expedition, th e measurements conducted on Site U1564 cores were reduced compared to the other sites. Th e cores were immediately run through the WR physical properties tracks upon retrieval withou t being thermally equilibrated. MS, GRA bulk density, and $P$ -wave velocity were measured at 2. 5 cm, and NGR was measured at one position ( $20~\mathrm{cm}$ resolution). The split section halves wer e imaged and measured for point MS and color reflectance (Figure F13). Sections were the n scanned for magnetic remanence using the SRM at $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ resolution and three demagnetizatio n steps (0, 15, and $20~\mathrm{mT}$ ). Samples were collected on the catwalk for headspace gas analysis an d postcruise biostratigraphy.  

The primary lithologies at Site U1564 are clay and silt. Cores 395C-U1564A-1H, 395C-U1564B1H, and 395C-U1564C-1H (0 to $\sim\!7\textrm{m}$ CSF-A) are composed of clay to silt with brown, gray, an d light gray banding. Cores 395C-U1564B-2H and 3H and 395C-U1564C-2H through 6H $(\sim\!7\!-\!54.82\$ m CSF-A) are a light gray to gray clay to silt. In Core 395C-U1564C-7H (54.5–64.62 m CSF-A), th e sediment transitions from a lighter gray to a dark gray. In Cores 8H–56X (64.0–444.46 m CSF-A), the clay to silt sediment shows gray to dark gray banding. Foraminifers can be seen on the spli t core surfaces, and dropstones and shell fragments are occasionally observed. Bioturbation is present in some intervals. Cores 57X–75X (444.6–629.12 m CSF-A) are clay-rich sediments that alternate between light gray, green, and dark gray in color. These cores have dark green, yellow, an d dark gray mottling, bioturbation, and erosional surfaces. The XCB cores are disturbed from th e coring process and contain core biscuits and fractures (Figure F5A, F5B).

Physical properties of the cores primarily reflect changes in their composition. MS values increas e from an average of $\mathord{\sim}200$ to ${\sim}400$ IU from 0 to $100\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ and remain relatively constant to 20 0 m CSF-A. Below this depth, MS slowly decreases to $\mathord{\sim}100$ IU at ${\sim}470\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. MS remains low t o $560\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, where values increase to ${\sim}750$ IU at $570\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A before decreasing to the botto m of the hole. NGR values average 13.7 counts/s between 0 and $316\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. NGR values are lowe r from 316 to $500~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A with an average of 10.2 counts/s. Three prominent NGR peaks occu r below $500\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ . $L^{\ast}$ trends downhole reflect the changes in core color, with lower $L^{\ast}$ value s associated with dark gray core and higher values associated with the lighter, green cores. The core s were not allowed to thermally equilibrate to room temperature before scanning, possibly impacting $P$ -wave velocity measurements.  

The downhole measurements program at Site U1564 consisted of downhole wireline logging an d formation temperature measurements. The triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings were ru n successfully to the base of the hole. Four formation temperature measurements from 54.5 to 140. 0 m DSF show a linear increase with depth from $8.7^{\circ}$ to $15.6^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

Core sections were run through the SRM, which measured NRM before and after AF demagnetization. The cores were scanned at $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution and demagnetized up to $20\;\mathrm{mT}.$ The XCB core s show a strong radial drilling overprint on the first two demagnetization steps that is not completely removed at $20~\mathrm{mT}$ . Notwithstanding the overprint, the magnetic inclination shows clea r intervals of normal and reversed polarity, which will be used postcruise to establish the magnetostratigraphy for the site.  

The only shipboard chemistry measurements were made on headspace gas to monitor hydrocarbon concentrations. Methane concentrations are near 0 ppmv for the uppermost $170\,\textrm{m}$ . Fro m ${\sim}170$ to $242\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A, methane increases to a maximum of 1263 ppmv and then graduall y decreases to 158 ppmv at the base of the hole.  

# 4.7. End of expedition  

The ship completed the $293{\mathrm{~nmi}}$ transit from Site U1564 to Reykjavík, Iceland, on 6 August 2021. The pilot boarded the vessel at $0748~\mathrm{h}$ . The first line ashore at Skarfabakki Harbor was at $0842\,\mathrm{h}$ marking the end of Expedition 395C.  

JOIDES Resolution operated in 12 holes across 5 sites (Table T1). Overall, $2866.6~\mathrm{m}$ of sedimen t and basalt was cored with $2444.36\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered $(85\%)$ from 406 cores. In addition, 1555. 1 m was drilled without coring.

# 5. Preliminary scientific assessment  

Despite the difficult conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the technical staff and crew o f Expedition 395C managed to collect cores from all five primary sites of the Expedition 395 origina l plan. This achievement is remarkable given the extraordinary challenges faced by all members o f the Siem, JRSO, and Entier personnel. The amount of recovered cores, their preliminary descriptions, and the analyses of shipboard samples show that the results of Expedition 395C will fulfill  a significant part of the Expedition 395 objectives (Figure F14). A more comprehensive descriptio n of the cores is scheduled postcruise with the Expedition 395C/395 science party. Also, the biostratigraphic analysis was not performed on board the ship and is still ongoing at this time.  

The first objective of Expedition 395/395C is to better understand the interaction between th e Reykjanes Ridge and the Iceland plume and its fluctuations and to test several hypotheses for th e generation of VSRs observed on either side of the ridge. During Expedition 395C, four site s reached the basement and collected cores from a series of flow units, allowing the measurement o f the basalt geochemical composition. Sites U1555 and U1563 sampled basement at VST-1 an d VSR-2a, respectively, and Sites U1554 and U1562 sampled basalts from VST-2b and VSR-3, respectively. The analysis of the basalt and basalt glass major and trace elements and isotopic compositions from these two pairs of VSRs/VSTs will allow us to estimate, for example, the variation s in mantle source, potential temperature, and depth of melting. These cores will thus reveal th e controlling factors at the origin of the VSR/VST variability and allow us to test the hypotheses fo r their formation. The basement at Site U1564 will be drilled and sampled during Expedition 39 5 and will complement our understanding of the factors controlling the crustal formation along th e Reykjanes Ridge at the same distance from the Iceland plume. Sites U1555, U1563, and U1562, fo r which the objectives were mostly the basement sampling, will not be revisited during Expeditio n 395 because all necessary operations have been completed there (Figure F14).  

The second objective of Expedition 395/395C is to estimate the temporal variations of the strengt h of the North Atlantic oceanic circulation, reflecting the intensity of the southern flow of dee p water from the Norwegian Sea at the oceanic gateways east and west of Iceland, and to compare i t with the fluctuations of the Iceland plume. This objective will be addressed through the analysis o f the sediment cores collected at Sites U1554 and U1564, which sampled the Björn and Garda r drifts, respectively. The accumulation rate of sediments at these contourite drifts is thought to b e moderated by the height of the oceanic gateways. The very good recovery of sediments from thes e sites, the presence of micro- and nannofossils (still under identification), and the excellent magnetic record measured along the cores ensure that we will obtain a good control on the age of th e sediments. We will thus be able to estimate the variations in sedimentation rates with age with  a high degree of accuracy. Coring at Site U1554 reached the basement, estimated to be $12.7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , an d the analysis of the cores will reveal the sedimentation history at the Björn drift during that period. Further coring at Site U1554 is required to produce a complete stratigraphic splice. Sediment coring at Site U1564 reached 628 meters below seafloor (mbsf), and we will need to core at this sit e during Expedition 395 to reach and core the basement, which is estimated to be $32.4\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , and cor e multiple sediment holes to investigate the history of the Gardar drift since Oligocene times. Th e analysis of the cores from Expedition 395C will allow us to reconstruct the contourite deposit s back in time compared to the $1.7\ \mathrm{Ma}$ sedimentary sequence cored at Site 983. The analysis o f dropstones and ice-rafted debris in the sediment cores at all sites will also allow us to decipher th e dynamics of glaciers in the North Atlantic in the Quaternary.

The third objective of Expedition 395/395C is the analysis of hydrothermal processes affecting th e ocean crust through interaction with seawater. During Expedition 395C, the sediment/basemen t interface was reached at four sites and basalt from the uppermost $130{-}200\;\mathrm{m}$ of the oceanic crus t were cored. From the youngest to the oldest sampled basement, the ages of basalts inferred fo r Sites U1555, U1563, U1554, and U1562 are 2.8, 5.2, 12.7, and $13.9\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively. Such a range o f crustal ages for basement created at the same location along the MOR (i.e., along a plate-spreadin g flow line) has seldom been sampled before. The sediment and basalt cores will allow us to investigate the fluid circulation and hydrothermal alteration with age. Hydrothermal alteration product s have been identified in veins within the recovered basalts. A comparison of the different sites wil l provide us with an exceptional view of the evolution in time of the hydrothermal processes.  

On top of the main objectives of the expedition, the wealth of data collected during Expeditio n 395C will allow us to address many other fundamental questions, including the microbiologica l activity in the sediment and basalt, the evolution of climate conditions in the North Atlantic sinc e Neogene times, and the dynamics of MOR eruptions, for example. We are optimistic that th e efforts of the technical staff and crew of Expedition 395C and the patience of the scientific part y during the 2 y between the staffing of the expedition and the description of the cores have a goo d chance of yielding invaluable scientific dividends.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Education and Outreach program for Expedition 395 C was adapted to include primarily shore-based activities so that the goals of the expedition an d IODP could still be communicated to general audiences. Expedition 395C had one shore-base d Outreach Officer, Jose Cuevas, based in Boston, Massachusetts (USA). Jose is currently at Bosto n College and was previously affiliated with the Birch Aquarium at Scripps in San Diego, Californi a (USA), as an informal science educator.  

The typical ship-to-shore events carried out during previous expeditions could not be undertaken. To overcome this limitation, the Outreach Officer enlisted the assistance of the shore-based science party and conducted seven “shore-to-shore” broadcasts with audiences including summe r camps, NSF-funded Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs, and teachin g workshops. A total of 118 individuals attended these events. The Outreach Officer also connecte d with a live audience twice via Facebook Live and YouTube Live. The first broadcast aired on 1 7 June 2021. The Outreach Officer interviewed the Co-Chief Scientists about the scientific objectives of Expedition 395C. This broadcast has 112 lifetime views on YouTube and 660 lifetime view s on Facebook. The second broadcast aired on 23 July. The Outreach Officer highlighted the effort s of the Filipino crew members of JOIDES Resolution. This live broadcast has 68 lifetime views o n YouTube and 878 lifetime views on Facebook, including over 220 Facebook views from the Philippines.  

The expedition blog (https://joidesresolution.org/expedition/reykjanes-mantle-convectionand-climate) was maintained through guest entries by members of the science party. Two blog s discussed conducting science from shore during an expedition.  

The Outreach Officer also acted in support of the JRSO’s efforts to highlight the different shipboard roles available by conducting brief interviews with four science party members who ha d previously sailed. The footage collected will be used to produce scientific role videos for the JRSO.  

Table T2. Total number of original posts, impressions, and engagements, Expedition 395C. Totals do not include replies o r retweets and only reflect number of impressions and engagements for first week they were posted.   


<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Posts</td><td>Impressions</td><td>Engagements</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>136</td><td>253,907</td><td>15,812</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>215</td><td>893,645</td><td>30,355</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>58</td><td></td><td>3,650</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The social media program during Expedition 395C was extremely successful based on metric s (Table T2), which includes original posts (retweets not included); impressions, which are the number of times a post has been displayed; and engagements, which includes likes, shares, and comments. The social media posts spanned Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram and were a collaboratio n between the Outreach Officer and the imaging specialist on the ship, Sarah Kachovich. Expeditio n 395C saw record numbers for posts, engagement, and impressions on Twitter. When considerin g both original posts and replies, 310 posts generated over 35,000 engagements and over 1,150,00 0 impressions. Part of the success of this social media outpouring can be attributed to the Tweet s and support of the shore-based science party and shipboard technical staff.
