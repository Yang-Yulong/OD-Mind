# 1. Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 385 drilled organic-rich sediments and intruded sills in the off-axis region and axial graben of the northern spreading segment of Guaymas Basin, a young marginal seafloor spreading system in the Gulf of California. Guaymas Basin is characterized by high heat flow and magmatism in the form of sill intrusions into sediments, which extends tens of kilometers off axis, in contrast with the localized volcanism found at most mid-ocean ridge spreading centers. Sill intrusions provide transient heat sources that mobilize buried sedimentary carbon, in part as methane and other hydrocarbons, and drive hydrothermal circulation. The resulting thermal and geochemical gradients shape abundance, composition, and activity of the deep subsurface biosphere of the basin.  

Drill sites extend over a broad region of Guaymas Basin. Adjacent Sites U1545 and U1546, located ${\sim}52~\mathrm{km}$ northwest of the northern Guaymas Basin axial graben, recovered sediment successions to $\mathord{\sim}540$ meters below seafloor (mbsf) (equivalent to the core depth below seafloor, Method A [CSF-A] scale), including a thin sill (a few meters thick) drilled near the bottom of Site U1545 and a massive sill $(\sim\!355\!-\!430\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ at Site U1546 that chemically and physically affects the surrounding sediments. Sites U1547 and U1548, located ${\sim}27\,\mathrm{km}$ northwest of the axial graben, were drilled to investigate an active sill-driven hydrothermal system evident at the seafloor as an $800\;\mathrm{m}$ wide, circular bathymetric high called Ringvent because of its outline of a ring of active vent sites. Ringvent is underlain by a thick sill at shallow depth (Site U1547). Geothermal gradients steepen toward the Ringvent periphery (Holes U1548A–U1548C), and the zones of authigenic carbonate precipitation and of highest microbial cell abundance correspondingly shallow toward the periphery. The underlying sill was drilled several times and yielded diverse igneous rock textures, sediment/sill interfaces, and alteration minerals in veins and vesicles. The Ringvent sill became the target of an integrated, interdisciplinary sampling and research effort that included geological, geochemical, and microbiological components. The thermal, lithologic, geochemical, and microbiological contrasts between the northwestern sites (U1545 and U1546) and the Ringvent sites (U1547 and U1548) form the core scientific observations informing the direct influence of sillsediment interaction. These observations are supplemented by results from sites that exhibit persistent influence of thermally equilibrated sill intrusions, including supporting long-lived methane cold seeps, as observed at off-axis Sites U1549 and U1552, and the persistent geochemical record of hydrocarbon formation near the sill/sediment contact, as observed at the northern axial trough Site U1550, which confirms observations from Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 64. Drilling at Site U1551 ${\sim}29~\mathrm{km}$ southeast of the axial graben was not successful due to unstable shallow sands, but it confirmed the dominant influence of gravity-flow sedimentation processes southeas t of the axial graben.  

The scientific outcomes of Expedition 385 will (1) revise long-held assumptions about the role o f sill emplacement in subsurface carbon mobilization versus carbon retention, (2) comprehensivel y examine the subsurface biosphere of Guaymas Basin and its responses and adaptations to hydrothermal conditions, (3) redefine hydrothermal controls on authigenic mineral formation in sediments, and (4) yield new insights into the long term influence of sill-sediment interaction o n sediments deposited at the earliest stages of seafloor spreading, that is, when spreading centers ar e proximal to a continental margin. The generally high quality and high degree of completeness o f the shipboard data sets present opportunities for inter- and multidisciplinary collaboration s during shore-based studies. In comparison to DSDP Leg 64 to Guaymas Basin in 1979, continuou s availability of sophisticated drilling strategies (e.g., the advanced piston corer [APC] and halflength APC systems) and numerous analytical innovations greatly improved sample recovery an d scientific yield, particularly in the areas of organic geochemistry and microbiology. For example, microbial metagenomics did not exist $40\ \mathrm{y}$ ago. However, these technical refinements do no t change the fact that Expedition 385 in many respects builds on the foundations of understandin g laid by Leg 64 drilling in Guaymas Basin.  

# 2. Introduction  

Guaymas Basin is a young marginal rift basin characterized by active seafloor spreading and rapi d sediment deposition, including organic-rich sediments derived from biologically highly productive overlying waters and terrigenous sediments from nearby continental margins (van Andel, 1964) (Figure F1). The combination of active seafloor spreading and rapid sedimentation within  a narrow basin results in a dynamic environment where linked physical, chemical, and biologica l processes regulate the cycling of sedimentary carbon (Figure F2). This continuum of interrelatin g processes from magma to microbe motivated International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP ) Expedition 385 and is reflected in its title, “Guaymas Basin Tectonics and Biosphere.”  

Formation of new igneous crust in Guaymas Basin involves the intrusion of sills into sedimentar y sequences (Einsele et al., 1980; Saunders et al., 1982). Heat introduced by intruding sills release s ${\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ , ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4},$ low molecular weight (LMW) organic acids, and petroleum from organic-rich sediments and drives fluid advection through sill-sediment sequences that can release these thermogenic products toward the sediment–seawater interface (Von Damm et al., 1985; Whelan an d Hunt, 1982; Kawka and Simoneit, 1987; Didyk and Simoneit, 1989; Martens, 1990; Peter et al., 1991). Thermal and chemical gradients linked to gas and fluid seepage create environments rich i n chemical energy that supports microbial life at and below the seafloor (Teske et al., 2014). Thes e microbes in turn participate in chemical transformations that influence the stability and transpor t of carbon in subsurface biospheres. Collectively, these physical, chemical, and biological processe s have implications for the exchange of heat and mass between the lithosphere and overlying seawater column and may determine the long-term fate of carbon accumulation in organic-rich sediments in new ocean basins.

# 3. Background  

# 3.1. Geological and microbiological roles in carbon cycling  

The Gulf of California is a narrow sea that formed through continental rifting between the Baj a California Peninsula and the western margin of mainland Mexico (Figure F1, inset), starting whe n the Baja Peninsula began to separate from North America at ${\sim}12{-}15\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Stock and Lee, 1994). A t present, the gulf is made up of a number of narrow spreading segments separated by transfor m faults that together represent the northern extent of the East Pacific Rise plate boundary (Figur e F1, inset). Most of these segments have rifted to completion, including the northern Guayma s Basin spreading segment, where seismic observations indicate that continental rupture was complete by ${\sim}7\mathrm{~Ma}$ and that new igneous crust formation has been accommodating Pacific/Nort h American plate motion since that time (Lizarralde et al., 2007; Miller and Lizarralde, 2013).  

The combination of distinct sedimentation patterns as well as active tectonics and magmatism i n the Gulf of California creates a rich environment for scientific discovery. Sedimentation and sediment thickness in the basins of the Gulf of California vary substantially from the very thick ( $_{>4}$ km) sediments blanketing Wagner, Tiburón, and Delfin Basins in the northernmost part of the gul f (e.g., Persaud et al., 2003; González-Fernández et al., 2005) to Alarcón Basin in the southern par t of the gulf, where the spreading center is only thinly sedimented (e.g., Sutherland et al., 2012). Th e northern Guaymas Basin segment, the focus of Expedition 385, lies between these extremes, an d both sediment deposition and sediment type vary significantly within the segment. Sedimentatio n in the northwestern half of the segment is dominantly biogenic and driven by highly productiv e waters with minor terrigenous input from the arid Baja California Peninsula (Calvert, 1966). I n contrast, sedimentation in the southeastern portion of the basin is dominated by terrigenous inpu t from the Yaqui River delta system of the Sonora margin, and the ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ deep graben that define s the plate boundary in this segment tends to confine the turbidites from the Yaqui system to th e southeastern horst region.  

Scientific drilling in Guaymas Basin has a profound history. Sites drilled in Guaymas Basin durin g Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 64 were motivated by both accessing the sediments themselves and by investigating the interaction of these sediments with magmatic processes. DSD P Sites 479 and 480 on the Sonora margin “focused on the paleoceanography of laminated, homogeneous, diatom-rich, anoxic sediments within the zone of low oxygen” typical of this settin g (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1982). Sites 477, 478, and 481 within the spreading segments wer e drilled to investigate “the nature of young ocean crust in the Guaymas Basin, where high accumulation rates are common and variable high heat flow indicates active rifting and hydrotherma l activity” (Kelts et al., 1982; Shipboard Scientific Party, 1982). The scientific results from Leg 6 4 contributed substantially to our understanding of the hydrothermal and geochemical processe s that accompany igneous intrusions into sediments (Curray et al., 1979; Curray, Moore, et al., 1982; Einsele et al., 1980; Gieskes et al. 1982). Leg 64 results documented important changes in the sediments due to sill intrusion, including the expulsion of pore fluids and decreased porosity (Einsele, 1982), the breakdown and creation of organic compounds (Galimov and Simoneit, 1982; Simonei t and Bode, 1982), and the dissolution of primary mineral phases and the formation of secondar y ones (Kastner, 1982), demonstrating that both temperature and vigor of fluid flow through th e alteration zone are important factors in alteration processes.  

At the time of Leg 64, it was believed that active magmatic emplacement was confined to  th e spreading centers (Einsele et al., 1980), and most of the subsequent work studying hightemperature biogeochemical processes in Guaymas Basin has been focused on the axial troughs. There is now strong evidence that magmatic intrusion into sediments occurs broadly throughou t the basin, to more than $50\,\mathrm{km}$ off axis (Lizarralde et al., 2011) (Figure F3). Magmatism that is no t confined to the spreading axis but instead is distributed throughout Guaymas Basin challenge s models for the natural sequestration of carbon in sediments, the formation of oceanic crust at th e earliest evolutionary stages of a spreading center, and life in the subsurface in marginal rift basins. Broadly distributed magmatism expands the fraction of organic-rich sediments that may be subject to thermal alteration and associated carbon release, potentially limiting the role of rift basi n sedimentation in the long-term removal of atmospheric $C O_{2}$ (Figure F2). Differences in subsurface hydrology and thermal gradients in off-axis environments relative to the fault-bounde d spreading center expand the range of environments that may support hydrocarbon generation an d microbial populations in the subsurface.  

The impact of sill-driven thermogenic sediment alteration on carbon cycling extends to regions o f large igneous province (LIP) formation. It has been postulated that the Paleocene/Eocene Therma l Maximum (PETM) was driven by widespread carbon release caused by numerous sill intrusion s into existing sedimentary basins during the formation of the North Atlantic Igneous Provinc e (Svensen et al., 2004; Higgins and Schrag, 2006). Sill-sediment processes have similarly been implicated in other global-scale environmental crises, for example by linking the Permian–Triassic an d Early Jurassic extinctions to the Siberian Traps and the Karoo Traps LIP events (Svensen et al., 2004, 2007, 2009a, 2009b; Sell et al., 2014; Galerne and Hasenclever, 2019), respectively. In addition, Cretaceous ocean anoxia events have been linked to concurrent submarine magmatism suc h as in the Caribbean (Turgeon and Creaser, 2008; Bralower, 2008). Guaymas Basin provides a modern analog to many aspects of these events.  

The fate of carbon deposited in Guaymas Basin and in similar marginal basins across the worl d during punctuated episodes of regional magmatism depends on the relative efficiencies of interacting physical, chemical, and microbial processes, some working to sequester carbon and other s working to release carbon back to the ocean and atmosphere (Figure F2). The physical and chemical processes immediately driven by a sill intrusion event include thermal heating of sediments b y the intruding sill, thermal cracking of organic compounds within sediments, mineral dehydratio n and dissolution, pore space desiccation, contact metamorphism and potentially partial melting o f the host sediment, and hydrothermal fluid convection (Simoneit et al., 1978, 1981; Simoneit an d Lonsdale, 1982; Saxby and Stephenson, 1987; Kastner, 1982; Fisher and Narasimhan, 1991; Aarne s et al., 2010, 2011, 2015; Iyer et al. 2013, 2017; Galerne and Hasenclever, 2019). The dominan t thermogenic alteration products resulting from sills intruding into organic-rich sediments ar e methane and ${\cal C}{\cal O}_{2}$ (Galimov and Simoneit, 1982; Seewald et al., 1990). For the Jurassic Karoo LI P event, quantitative modeling recently estimated a total degassing of ${\sim}22.3\ 10^{3}$ Gt of thermogeni c methane during the $500{,}000\;\mathrm{y}$ of Karoo magmatism, showing that degassing rates peaking abov e $100\,\mathrm{Mt/y}$ could be sustained over a period of 5,000–60,000 y (Galerne and Hasenclever, 2019).  

The extent and function of the deep subsurface biosphere in these settings has not been probe d since Leg 64 demonstrated microbial methanogenesis in Guaymas Basin subsurface sediments; this was the first time that microbiological studies were performed during a deep-sea drillin g expedition (Oremland et al., 1982; Galimov and Simoneit, 1982; Whelan et al., 1988). Because th e present project has a strong microbiological research component, we briefly summarize how studies of pure cultures and natural enrichments from near-surface hydrothermal sediments of Guaymas Basin, usually obtained using submersibles, have outlined the thermal boundaries fo r microbial processes in Guaymas Basin sediments. At the hyperthermophilic end of the spectrum, the $\mathrm{{H_{2}/C O_{2}}}$ -dependent methanogen Methanopyrus kandleri survives at $110^{\circ}C$ under atmospheri c pressure  (Kurr et  al., 1991) and at $122^{\circ}C$ under deep-sea pressure (Takai et al.,  2008). Sulfur‐reducing Thermococcales thrive near $100^{\circ}C$ (Teske et al., 2009; Edgcomb et al., 2007), an d microbial sulfate reducers are active near $90^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Elsgaard et al., 1994; Jørgensen et al., 1990; Webe r and Jørgensen, 2002) and potentially near $120^{\circ}C$ (Jørgensen et al., 1992). Hyperthermophiles commonly utilize hydrogen as an electron donor, which leads to selective hydrogen depletion in th e hydrothermal subsurface (Wankel et al., 2011). Recently, anaerobic methane‐oxidizing archae a that are active at temperatures as high as $75\mathrm{^\circC}$ were identified in Guaymas Basin and at other ven t sites (Holler et al., 2011; Biddle et al., 2012; Merkel et al., 2013; McKay et al., 2016). At cooler, off‐axis locations and in the upper sediment column, less extreme microbiota gain a foothold, increasing overall microbial biomass and activity and broadening the chemical spectrum of microbially catalyzed reactions. For example, alkane-degrading syntrophic archaea and sulfate-reducin g bacteria with a temperature preference of $50^{\circ}{-}60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ thrive in Guaymas Basin sediments (Rueter e t al., 1994; Kniemeyer et al., 2007; Laso-Pérez et al., 2016; Krukenberg et al., 2016); uncultured representatives are detectable with gene assays for anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation (Callaghan e t al., 2010). Finally, surface sediments harbor microbial mats of sulfide-oxidizing filamentous bacteria at the seawater interface (Gundersen et al., 1992; McKay et al., 2012), along with mesophilic, aerobic aromatics degraders (Goetz and Jannasch, 1993; Gutierrez et al., 2015). In general, microbial communities in surficial sediments of Guaymas Basin overlap compositionally with those i n seeps and cold subsurface sediments (Teske et al., 2002; Teske, 2006). Collectively, these diversifie d microbial communities are capable of assimilating fossil organic carbon into microbial biomas s (Pearson et al., 2005). The habitat preference, biogeography, and activity patterns of these Guaymas Basin microorganisms remain to be investigated in the subsurface. We should also remai n open to the possibility of finding new organisms that currently have no precedent. For example, metagenomic analyses of hydrothermal Guaymas Basin sediments have detected new lineages o f the Asgardarchaeota (Dombrowski et al., 2018; Seitz et al., 2019), the archaeal superphylum tha t shares eukaryotic genes to an uncommon degree and is considered the closest living affiliate t o ancestral eukaryotes.

# 3.2. Site surveys and seismic studies  

Expedition 385 is supported by site survey data acquired on five ships during cruises led by chie f scientists from three countries (US, Germany, and Mexico). The three seismic data sets wer e acquired during research vessel (R/V) Maurice Ewing Cruise EW0210 (2002), R/V Sonne Cruis e SO-241 (2015), and R/V Alpha Helix Cruise AH1605 (2016). The Cruise EW0210 seismic data, acquired with a $6~\mathrm{km}$ streamer (led by Chief Scientist Daniel Lizarralde, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, US), provided seismic-velocity control for time-to-depth estimations at al l Expedition 385 sites. Ultimately, five of eight sites drilled during Expedition 385 were propose d based on features observed in the migrated stack of the transect (Figure F3). The seismic featur e observed at Site U1548 motivated the hypothesis that active magmatism occurs at substantial distances from the plate boundary. From this, it follows that active, methane-hosted seafloor communities are expected to be present throughout Guaymas Basin, a hypothesis that was tested throug h a deep-tow multibeam survey conducted during R/V Atlantis Cruise AT15-54 in 2009. By mean s of deep-tow backscatter and compressed high-intensity radar pulse (CHIRP) subbottom images, seafloor photography, and water chemistry samples, this cruise identified multiple methanehosted seafloor communities at off-axis locations (Lizarralde et al., 2011). The observations fro m Cruise AT15-54 motivated several drill sites for which no seismic data were available. The secon d seismic survey was performed during Cruise SO-241 in 2015 (led by Chief Scientist Christia n Berndt, GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, Germany). The transect of thes e high-quality data crossed some but not all of the proposed drill sites. The third seismic survey (le d by Chief Scientist Antonio González-Fernández, Centro de Investigación Científica y de Educación Superior de Ensenada [CICESE], Mexico) acquired seismic crossing lines through all of th e proposed drill sites during Cruise AH-1605.  

Sites initially selected based on the Cruise EW0210 multichannel seismic profiles (Lizarralde et al., 2007) and the observations from Cruise AT15-54 (Lizarralde et al., 2011) were adjusted based o n results from the new seismic lines and two additional site survey cruises by the R/V El Puma (7– 27 October 2014) and Atlantis (9–27 December 2016). The 2014 El Puma cruise (led by Chie f  

Scientist Carlos Mortera, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México [UNAM], Mexico) performed a detailed bathymetric survey of the central portion of the northern Guaymas Basi n spreading segment and collected sediment piston cores $3{-}5\ \mathrm{m}$ in length from the northwester n side of the northern spreading segment, the Sonora margin, and the circular seep structure calle d Ringvent. These cores provided shallow subsurface sediments near several proposed Expeditio n 385 drill sites and enabled a preliminary geochemical and microbial characterization of the proposed off-axis drill sites (Teske et al., 2019; Ramírez et al., 2020). Numerous shallow sedimen t cores and seafloor grab samples were also collected during Sonne Cruise 241 (Núñez-Useche et al., 2018; Geilert et al., 2018). A major discovery from that cruise was a large, active hydrothermal ven t field located on the southeastern edge of the northern Guaymas Basin graben (Berndt et al., 2016). The last site survey cruise on Atlantis studied the Ringvent sites (U1547 and U1548) with huma n occupied vehicle (HOV) Alvin Dives 4864 and 4865 and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV ) Sentry Dives 410 and 411 (led by Chief Scientist Andreas Teske, University of North Carolina a t Chapel Hill, US) providing faunal observations, microbial analyses, thermal gradient measurements in surficial sediments, and mineralogic and pore water chemistry analyses that demonstrated this site is hydrothermally active (Teske et al., 2019). These results were used to furthe r characterize the proposed Ringvent drill sites and to adjust their locations.  

# 3.3. Scientific objectives  

The following three primary scientific objectives were outlined in the Expedition 385 Scientifi c Prospectus (Teske et al., 2018):  

• Quantify the sedimentary and elemental inputs to the basin through time and their variation with changing oceanographic and climatic conditions.   
• Sample sill intrusions and the surrounding sediments to determine the products and efficiency of hydrothermal alteration and key hydrologic factors such as sediment type, faulting, and permeability evolution and how they impact the subsurface storage and flow of sedimentary carbon.   
• Study subsurface microbial communities hosted by alteration products to determine their efficiency at capturing carbon-bearing alteration products and to further our understanding of the conditions that limit life in the deep biosphere.  

The northwest–southeast transect of drill sites established during Expedition 385 represents al l kinds of depositional settings in Guaymas Basin that have sills intruding the local sediment successions on and off axis at a wide range of depths (from $<\!100$ to ${>}600$ meters below seafloor [mbsf]). The comprehensive characterization of these sill-sediment packages in terms of the interactin g physical, chemical, and microbial processes will enable us to decipher the fate of sedimentary carbon (sequestration versus release) in Guaymas Basin. From this study we will be able to draw conclusions for the entire Gulf of California and similar marginal seas on Earth.

# 4.1.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1545 (proposed Site GUAYM-01B) is located ${\sim}52~\mathrm{km}$ northwest of the axial graben of th e northern Guaymas Basin spreading segment (Figure F1). The primary objective for this site i s shared with Site U1546, located just $1.1~\mathrm{km}$ away (Figure F4). The objective is to compare th e sediments at two sites that are very close to each other but that, as seismic data suggest, have ha d very different degrees of alteration from intruding sills. Preexpedition seismic survey data indicat e an undisturbed sedimentary succession at Site U1545 from the seafloor to ${\sim}2.8$ s two-way traveltime (TWT) $({\sim}540~\mathrm{mbsf})$ , where an interpreted sill was observed. In contrast, seismic data sho w the same stratigraphic sequence at Site U1546 to be substantially disturbed between an apparen t unconformity at ${\sim}2.3$ s TWT and a bright reflector at ${\sim}2.6$ s TWT $({\sim}350\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ ), which was interpreted to be a sill intrusion. Sills deeper than 2.6 s TWT were also interpreted at Site U1546. Comparison of Sites U1545 and U1546 thus enables the quantification of thermal and hydrotherma l alteration driven by sill intrusion at Site U1546.  

# 4.1.2. Operations  

We cored three holes at Site U1545. Hole U1545A is located at $27^{\circ}38.2325\mathrm{\,N}$ , $111^{\circ}53.3406^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in  a water depth of $1593.5\;\mathrm{m}$ . In Hole U1545A, we used the advanced piston corer (APC), half-lengt h APC (HLAPC), and extended core barrel (XCB) systems to advance from the seafloor to a fina l depth of 503.3 mbsf with a recovery of $389.0\;\mathrm{m}\;(77\%)$ . We made formation temperature measurements at several depths using the advanced piston corer temperature (APCT-3) and Sedimen t Temperature 2 (SET2) tools. We terminated coring based on the safety monitoring protocol fo r hydrocarbon gases after measuring a low methane/ethane $(C_{1}/C_{2})$ value. We then conducte d downhole measurements in Hole U1545A: (1) recovery of borehole fluid with the Kuster Flo w Through Sampler (Kuster FTS) and (2) downhole logging with the triple combination (tripl e combo) and Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic logging tool strings. In Hole U1545B, locate d at $27^{\circ}38.2301\mathrm{\,N}$ , $111^{\circ}53.3295^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in a water depth of $1594.2\;\mathrm{m},$ we deployed the APC, HLAPC, an d XCB systems. Cores penetrated from the seafloor to a final depth of 387.3 mbsf and recovere d $340.1\mathrm{~m~}(88\%)$ . Formation temperature measurements were carried out at several depths with th e APCT-3 and SET2 tools. In Hole U1545C, located at $27^{\circ}38.2420\,\mathrm{N},$ , $111^{\circ}53.3290^{\prime}\mathrm{{W}}$ in a wate r depth of $1595.0\;\mathrm{m},$ we deployed the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems to advance from the seafloo r to a final depth of 329.0 mbsf with a recovery of $324.6\;\mathrm{m}\;(99\%)$ . Holes U1545B and U1545C wer e dedicated to extensive microbial and biogeochemical sampling that required the deployment o f perfluorocarbon tracers (PFTs) downhole on all cores to monitor drilling fluid (seawater) contamination (House et al., 2003; Lever et al., 2006). During the first 2 days of coring in Hole U1545B, th e pace of coring was adjusted to accommodate the complex microbial sampling program conducte d on the core receiving platform. A total of $232.1\,\mathrm{h}_{:}$ , or 9.7 days, were spent at Site U1545. Cores, penetration depths, core recovery, and operations schedule for all holes of Site U1545 are listed i n Table T1.

# 4.1.3. Principal results  

# 4.1.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The deepest record of sediments and igneous rocks was recovered in Hole U1545A from a curate d depth of 507.27 mbsf, whereas recovery reached 387.23 and 328.88 mbsf in Holes U1545B an d U1545C, respectively. Site U1545 is composed of late to middle Pleistocene sediments that ar e primarily a mixture of laminated diatom ooze and clay minerals (Figure F5). Minor component s encompass nannofossils and silt-sized siliciclastic particles and authigenic minerals. The latte r include pyrite and clay- to silt-sized carbonate (micrite) particles (mainly dolomite) that occu r both scattered in the sediment and concentrated in discrete nodules/concretions with differen t degrees of lithification. Downhole changes in lithology are not significant enough to require a division of the site into more than one lithostratigraphic unit (Unit I). However, the presence of mino r yet significant downhole lithologic changes and/or changes in sediment induration and physica l properties prompt the division of Unit I into four subunits (IA–ID). These differences arise mainl y from different degrees and types of diagenetic processes and overprinting that have resulted in th e formation of authigenic minerals (e.g., micrite in Subunit IB) and/or the selective dissolution o f sedimentary particles (e.g., dissolution of diatoms during opal-A to opal-CT phase transformatio n in Subunits IC and ID). The transitions between subunits are gradual, occur over more than on e core, and may be locally obscured in low-recovery zones. The mixed biogenic and siliciclasti c nature of the sediments and the abundance of fine lamination in the sedimentary record sugges t that the depositional environment at Site U1545 has remained essentially hemipelagic and suboxi c to anoxic throughout the middle to late Pleistocene. Igneous rocks of subvolcanic texture an d basaltic composition were encountered as an intrusive sheet in the sedimentary section near th e bottom of Hole U1545A.

# 4.1.3.2. Igneous petrology and alteration  

In Hole U1545A, we penetrated a mafic sill intrusion hosted by siliceous claystone and recovere d a total core length of $86\;\mathrm{cm}$ from a top depth of 482.17 mbsf. This thin hypabyssal rock layer i s identified as part of Subunit ID. It is dominantly composed of aphyric basalt. A ${\sim}3\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick bake d layer of carbonate metasedimentary rock forms the upper contact with the sill. The dark gra y aphyric basalt has an aphanitic texture with a micro to cryptocrystalline inequigranular igneou s mineral assemblage consisting of plagioclase, pyroxene, and accessory Fe-Ti oxides. Moderate t o sparse vesicularity overall decreases with depth. Plagioclase phenocrysts are rarely present ( $\cdot{<}1$ $\mathrm{vol}\%$ ). The entire cored length of the basaltic rock layer is texturally and mineralogically homogeneous except for a $_{1\;\mathrm{cm}}$ thick, carbonate-rich vesicular interval in the middle of the sectio n that has an overall coarser grain size and no microphenocrysts. The entire recovered sectio n shows moderate alteration that is consistent with hydrothermal fluid-rock interaction. Plagioclase grains are slightly altered to sericite, whereas pyroxenes remain only as pseudomorph s that are totally replaced by secondary magnetite and clay minerals. Vesicles are mostly filled wit h secondary minerals. These precipitates are dominantly carbonates (e.g., calcite and dolomite ) and clay minerals (e.g., smectite) with minor magnetite and pyrite. Observed veins are predominantly filled with carbonates, pyrite, and zeolites, giving them a white color with black and golde n patches.

# 4.1.3.3. Structural geology  

Tilted sedimentary beds and deformation structures are found in some depth intervals in Lithostratigraphic Subunits IA–ID. The folds and tilted beds observed in two depth intervals above 10 9 mbsf are attributed to two slump events that caused soft-sediment deformation. At greater depth, some preexisting brittle fractures are found. Some of the layers in Subunit IC exhibit fractures wit h apparent dips of $60^{\circ}$ relative to the core axis. The mafic sill (Subunit ID) has mineralized fracture s that are subvertical in orientation.

# 4.1.3.4. Biostratigraphy  

At Site U1545, preservation of calcareous nannofossils is good/moderate to poor throughout th e entire sedimentary sequence. In general, preservation is good/moderate in samples with abundan t or common nannofossils and poor in those with frequent or rare nannofossils. Preservation is better in samples taken from intervals above the core catcher than in core catcher samples. Overall, marine diatoms were observed to be dominant/abundant with good/moderate preservation t o $\mathord{\sim}300$ mbsf and barren to the bottom of Holes U1545A and U1545B as a result of silica diagenesis. One biostratigraphic datum was recognized, and two additional stratigraphically underlyin g datums were estimated based on the absence of the zonal markers in the generally continuou s succession from the late to middle Pleistocene. The lowermost occurrence (i.e., first occurrenc e datum) of Emiliania huxleyi dates the upper part of the sediment sequence to (Holocene–)late– middle Pleistocene (younger than $0.29\,M{\bf a}$ ; Hole $\mathrm{U}1545\mathrm{A}=0{-}248.6$ mbsf; Hole $\mathrm{U}1545\mathrm{B}=0{-}249.6$ mbsf), whereas the absence of Pseudoemiliania lacunosa (calcareous nannofossil) and Fragilariopsis reinholdii (marine diatom) in samples examined from the underlying interval indicates  a middle Pleistocene age (younger than $0.44\,M{\bf a}$ ) for the bottom of both holes. Hole U1545C was no t sampled. The estimated average sedimentation rate is $863\;\mathrm{m}$ /My $(86.3\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ ).  

# 4.1.3.5. Paleomagnetism  

Alternating field (AF) demagnetization up to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ was conducted with the superconductin g rock magnetometer (SRM) on all archive-half sections from Hole U1545A. The drilling-induce d overprint was successfully removed from APC and HLAPC cores (from the seafloor to ${\sim}280\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) upon demagnetization. Inclination values after demagnetization at $20~\mathrm{{mT}}$ cluster around $46^{\circ}$ which is similar to the expected geocentric axial dipole (GAD) inclination at the latitude of the sit e $(46.3^{\circ})$ . This is supported by a detailed analysis of the remanence of discrete samples. The drillinginduced overprint is removed by $10\,\mathrm{mT}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , and the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) i s consistent with the SRM measurements. Unfortunately, XCB cores were overprinted and too disturbed to yield reliable paleomagnetic data, and no discrete samples could be collected. Cores 385- U1545A-1H through 50F (to ${\sim}280~\mathrm{\mbsf}_{\mathrm{~}}$ ) were assigned to the normal Brunhes Chron C1 n (younger than $0.78\,\mathrm{\:Ma})$ . The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of archive-half section s decreases from ${\sim}50$ to 80 mbsf in a depth interval that corresponds to the sulfate–methane transition zone (SMTZ). The magnetic mineral assemblage becomes coarser, and low-coercivity minerals, likely (titano)magnetite, are dominant. In addition, AF demagnetization up to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ wa s carried out on archive-half sections from Hole U1545B (Cores 46F–60F) to increase the dept h interval of paleomagnetic measurements on HLAPC cores. This enabled us to make a tentativ e correlation between Holes U1545A and U1545B based on the NRM and point magnetic susceptibility that gives a possible offset of about $3\,\mathrm{m}$ between holes. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibilit y (AMS) shows a mixture of prolate and oblate behavior in the sediments. No paleomagnetic measurements were carried out in Hole U1545C.

A total of 80 interstitial water (IW) samples were collected from the sedimentary successions i n Holes U1545A–U1545C. Sulfate concentration decreases to almost zero and methane concentration sharply increases around 50 mbsf at the SMTZ. Biogeochemical processes from the seafloo r to 50 mbsf, including organoclastic sulfate reduction and anaerobic oxidation of methane, led t o the accumulation of by-products such as sulfide, ammonium, and phosphate; a correspondin g sharp increase in alkalinity; and a continuous increase in bromide. The downward increase i n ammonium concentration to a maximum of $>\!30\ \mathrm{mM}$ around 250 mbsf indicates ongoing microbial remineralization of organic matter. The significant decrease in calcium concentration towar d the top of Subunit IB near 70–80 mbsf may correspond to the precipitation of authigenic carbonates. The drop in alkalinity and magnesium at ${\sim}70{-}80$ mbsf could indicate the precipitation o f authigenic dolomite, whereas the increase in calcium concentration could reflect the dissolutio n of carbonate phases other than dolomite. Chloride, silica, strontium, lithium, boron, and bariu m contents also continuously increase as a result of the dissolution of minerals such as silicates. Calcium, silica, strontium, lithium, boron, and barium concentrations continuously increase betwee n 220 and 320 mbsf. The maximum concentration of dissolved silica is seen at $\mathord{\sim}290$ mbsf, belo w which depth the profile starts to reverse. Around the same depth, bromide, lithium, boron, strontium, barium, and sodium sharply increase and potassium sharply decreases. Below ${\sim}320$ mbsf,  a number of significant variations (increase or decrease) are observed for many dissolved element s ( $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ , B, $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ , etc.) and are possibly related to a combination of diagenetic processes (opal diagenesis, smectite to illite transformation, or the dissolution/precipitation of other minerals) as wel l as thermal alteration during and after sill intrusion. Alternatively, data variability and some excursions may reflect erratic contamination of sediment derived from drilling-induced generation o f core fragments that mix with drilling mud during XCB coring.  

# 4.1.3.7. Organic geochemistry  

At Site U1545, we performed analyses of gas and solid-phase samples. For Hole U1545A, on e headspace gas sample was analyzed per $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of core for routine hydrocarbon safety monitoring. The carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur content of particulate sediment was characterized, and sourc e rock analysis was performed on selected solid-phase samples. For Hole U1545B, hydrocarbon s were analyzed for both headspace gas and void gas; the amount of void space was quantified; $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO contents were measured; the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents of sediment were characterized; and a comprehensive suite of gas and sediment samples was taken for postexpeditio n analyses. The SMTZ is at approximately 40–50 mbsf in the three holes, and $C_{2}..C_{6}$ hydrocarbon s are detectable below 100 mbsf. In Hole U1545A, low ${C_{1}}/{C_{2}}$ values below the thin basaltic roc k layer necessitated the termination of drilling. From elemental and source rock analysis, we infe r that the primary source of organic matter is marine in origin and the thermal maturity of organi c matter varies based on the proximity of the sill. In Holes U1545B and U1545C, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO ar e present in low concentrations, which suggests that biological cycling is the dominant control o n these gases.  

# 4.1.3.8. Microbiology  

Sediment cores from below 480 mbsf in Hole U1545A and throughout Holes U1545B and U1545 C span the temperature range from the cold seafloor to hot $({\sim}89^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ subsurface sediments that i s potentially populated by psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic microorganisms. Thus, these cores were extensively sampled for microbiology and biogeochemistry, and those sample s captured the entire spatial and thermal gradient in the penetrated sediment column at Site U1545. Syringe samples for cell counts, 3-D structural imaging, and RNA analyses were taken on the cor e receiving platform, preserved or frozen, and stored for further analyses. Whole-round sample s were either stored in a $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer or temporarily stored in a $4^{\circ}{-}8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ cold room and processe d further for shore-based analyses. Here and at all other Expedition 385 sites, whole-round sampl e processing was conducted either inside a Coy Laboratory Products anaerobic chamber equippe d with Table KOACH air purification unit or on the bench with a KOACH open clean zone syste m to maintain conditions that were as sterile as possible. Samples for PFT measurements were take n by syringe at 11 distinct sediment horizons on the core receiving platform. Shipboard cell count s showed that abundance gradually decreases with depth from $5.8\times10^{8}$ cells $\scriptstyle\mathbf{Cm}^{3}$ at the seawater– sediment interface to $8.2\times10^{5}\,\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at approximately 150 mbsf. Except for a local spike at 29 0 mbsf (Section 385-U1545B-50F-3) with a cell abundance of $3\times10^{5}\,\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , cell numbers farthe r downhole drop below the detection limit of the protocol that we used for the shipboard cell counting program.  

# 4.1.3.9. Petrophysics  

Physical properties of whole-round and split cores were measured in the laboratory, and in sit u measurements were made using downhole logging tools. Measurements on whole-round an d working-half sections from Holes U1545A–U1545C were compared with each other an d with downhole measurements from Hole U1545A for lithostratigraphic characterization and integration of core description, borehole data, and seismic profiles. These measurements include d whole-round bulk density estimated from gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density, magneti c susceptibility (MS), natural gamma radiation (NGR) (sensitive to the abundance of minerals containing radioisotopes of K, U, and Th), $P$ -wave velocity, and discrete measurements of moistur e and density (MAD) (to estimate porosity), thermal conductivity, three-component $P.$ -wave velocity, and rheological properties (shear and compressional strength). Two types of changes wer e observed in the GRA bulk density. The first type is observed in the uppermost $100\;\mathrm{m}$ of sedimen t and the second type to $\mathord{\sim}280$ mbsf. Density generally increases by 0.11 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ every $100\,\textrm{m}$ .  A steeper increase in density $(0.14~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ every $100\ \mathrm{m},$ ) was observed from $\mathord{\sim}280$ mbsf to the fina l curated depth of Hole U1545A at 507.7 mbsf. This density increase is particularly well correlate d with NGR values and corresponds to a change in lithology from diatom clay to siliceous claystone. MS values show peaks at 60, 170, and 482–483 mbsf that are also seen in the bulk density and NG R data. Two downhole logging tool strings were run in Hole U1545A: the triple combo (NGR, porosity, and density, including MS, resistivity, caliper, and logging head temperature) and FMS-soni c (resistivity images, caliper, acoustic velocity, and NGR) tool strings. Because of a malfunctionin g caliper on the upward pass, only one pass was possible with the triple combo. In general, downhole measurements are consistent with results obtained from the whole-round and working-hal f cores. In addition to the logging tools, nine in situ formation temperature measurements wer e conducted with the APCT-3 and SET2 tools, indicating that temperature increases with dept h along a linear geothermal gradient of $225^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ that corresponds to a calculated heat flow of 16 1 $\mathrm{{mW/m^{2}}}$ .  

# 4.2. Site U1546  

# 4.2.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1546 (proposed Site GUAYM-02B) is located just $1.1\,\mathrm{km}$ away from Site U1545 and ${\sim}51\,\mathrm{km}$ northwest of the axial graben of the northern Guaymas Basin spreading segment (Figures F1, F4). The primary objective was to compare these two adjacent sites that have shared sedimentatio n history but very different degrees of alteration resulting from intruding sills. Preexpedition seismi c survey data at Site U1546 revealed a bright reflector at ${\sim}2.6$ s TWT that was interpreted to be th e contact with a sill intrusion. Disruption of the sedimentary strata above the interpreted sill $(\sim\!2.3-$ 2.6 s TWT) was supposed to have formed as a response to the sill emplacement. This featur e abruptly terminates laterally toward Site U1545, coincident with the termination of the underlyin g sill. This same sedimentary sequence appears undisrupted at Site U1545 to ${\sim}2.8$ s TWT, wher e another sill was observed in the seismic data. The shared objective for Sites U1545 and U1546 wa s to compare the composition, physical properties, geochemical gradients, and microbial communities at these sites. Thus, the major objective for Site U1546 was to provide a postintrusion sedimentary succession for comparison with the reference Site U1545; this comparison will provid e direct measurements of changes in response to sill intrusion.  

# 4.2.2. Operations  

We cored four holes at Site U1546. Hole U1546A is located at $27^{\circ}37.8851\,\mathrm{N}$ , $111^{\circ}52.7939^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in  a water depth of $1586.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . In Hole U1546A, we used the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems t o advance from the seafloor to a final depth of 361.2 mbsf with a recovery of $365.7\mathrm{~m~}(101\%)$ . W e performed formation temperature measurements at several depths using the APCT-3 and SET 2 tools. In Hole U1546B, located at $27^{\circ}37.8840\,\mathrm{N},$ , $111^{\circ}52.7809^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in a water depth of $1585.6\;\mathrm{m}$ , w e deployed the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems. Cores penetrated from the seafloor to a final dept h of 333.8 mbsf and recovered $351.2~\mathrm{~m~}$ $(105\%)$ . In Hole U1546C, located at $27^{\circ}37.8724\,\mathrm{N},$ $111^{\circ}52.7568^{\prime}\mathbb{W}$ in a water depth of $1596.6\mathrm{~m~}$ , we first drilled without core recovery from the seafloor to 308.2 mbsf. Then, the rotary core barrel (RCB) system was deployed to advance fro m 308.2 mbsf to a final depth of 540.2 mbsf with a recovery of $139.7\mathrm{~m~}(60\%)$ . Coring was terminate d when the safety monitoring for hydrocarbon gases obtained an anomalously low $C_{1}/C_{2}$ value. W e then conducted downhole wireline logging in Hole U1546C with the triple combo and FMS-soni c logging tool strings. In Hole U1546D, located at $27^{\circ}37.8943\,\mathrm{{N}}$ , $111^{\circ}52.7812^{\prime}\mathbb{W}$ in a water depth o f $1585.9\;\mathrm{m},$ , we deployed the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems to advance from the seafloor to a fina l depth of 300.1 mbsf with a recovery of $314.7\,\mathrm{m}$ $(105\%)$ . Holes U1546B and U1546D were dedicate d to extensive microbial and biogeochemical sampling that required the deployment of PFTs downhole on all cores to monitor drilling fluid (seawater) contamination. The pace of coring in Hole s U1546B and U1546D was at times adjusted to accommodate the complex microbial sampling program conducted on the core receiving platform. A total of $270.7\,\mathrm{h}_{:}$ , or 11.3 days, were spent at Sit e U1546. Cores, penetration depths, core recovery, and operations schedule for all holes of Sit e U1546 are listed in Table T1.  

# 4.2.3. Principal results  

# 4.2.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Of the four holes cored at Site U1546, the most complete and deepest record of soft and indurate d sediments as well as igneous rocks is represented by the combination of results from Hole s U1546A and U1546C. The sediments recovered are middle to late Pleistocene in age, mostly laminated to homogeneous diatom ooze to diatom clay forming a single lithostratigraphic unit (Unit I ) (Figure F6). Subordinate lithologic components include nannofossils, silt-sized siliciclastic particles, and authigenic minerals such as pyrite and clay- to silt-sized carbonate (micrite). The latter i s mainly dolomitic in composition and occurs as scattered crystals in the sediment. Carbonate als o occurs as discrete concretions and ultimately as indurated limestone/dolomite intervals at depth. The distribution of authigenic carbonates as well as the biogenic (opal-A) to authigenic (opal-CT, quartz) silica phase transformations produce subtle yet distinct lithologic changes supporting th e division of Unit I into four subunits (IA–ID). The transitions between the subunits are generall y gradual, occurring over more than $10\;\mathrm{m}$ thick intervals, and can be difficult to define in low recovery or heavily sampled zones. The clay-rich diatom ooze of Subunit IA becomes more micritic i n Subunit IB, which in turn is underlain by the less calcareous, largely micrite-free Subunit IC. Th e Subunit IC–ID transition is marked by diatom (opal-A) dissolution, the appearance of opal-CT, and ultimately authigenic quartz that heralds the formation of siliceous claystone in Subunit ID. Although the subunit divisions are similar to those at Site U1545, Subunit IB is thicker and shallower at Site U1546. There are also distinct zones of altered sediment above and below the thic k mafic sill interval in Subunit ID that was fully penetrated in Hole U1546C. The mixed biogenic an d siliciclastic sediments and their characteristic lamination are consistent with a middle to late Pleistocene, hemipelagic and suboxic to anoxic depositional environment.  

# 4.2.3.2. Igneous petrology and alteration  

Mafic sill material was encountered in Holes U1546A and U1546C at 354.6 and 348.2 mbsf, respectively. In Hole U1546A, the massive hypabyssal sill was penetrated over an interval of $6.0\;\mathrm{m}$ , whereas Hole U1546C was cored through the lower sill/sediment contact, resulting in a total sil l thickness of $82.2~\mathrm{m}$ based on drilling and ${\sim}75\mathrm{~m~}$ according to downhole logging data. The sill i s made up of highly altered basaltic rock at the top followed by doleritic and gabbroic intervals.  A doleritic texture resumes below the gabbroic interval and is followed by a short basaltic interval a t the bottom contact. The upper- and lowermost basaltic rock intervals have chilled margin contacts with the adjacent sediments, being highly altered and vesicular with rounded to subrounde d calcite amygdules. The cryptocrystalline groundmass hosts plagioclase phenocrysts. The doleriti c intervals close to the basaltic layers are sparsely vesicular and gradually turn into nonvesicular doleritic rock toward the center of the sill. A ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{m}$ thick gabbroic interval is intercalated between th e doleritic layers. The contacts between gabbroic and doleritic lithologies are both sharp and gradational. Plagioclase phenocrysts are present throughout the doleritic intervals, whereas pyroxen e pseudomorphs occur as a minor phenocryst phase in the bottom doleritic layer, below the gabbroic interval. No pyroxene phenocrysts were observed in the upper doleritic part of the sill intrusion. This sill shows a subalkaline, tholeiitic mafic rock chemistry that corresponds to an enriche d mid-ocean-ridge basalt (MORB) composition.  

# 4.2.3.3. Structural geology  

A few intervals of tilted beds were seen in the sedimentary section of Lithostratigraphic Unit I. Hole U1546A has tilted bedding in the uppermost two subunits (IA and IB) from 98 to 117 mbsf. Also, tilted bedding occurs in Subunit IB from 115 to 124 mbsf in Hole U1546B and from 112 t o 120 mbsf and from 145 to 156 mbsf in Hole U1546D. Brittle fractures and faults were found i n sedimentary cores below 200 mbsf in Hole U1546D and below 166 mbsf in Hole U1546B. The y have intermediate apparent dips $(30^{\circ}{-}60^{\circ})$ . Where displacements could be measured, they were ${\le}5$ cm. Six vertical veins were measured in sedimentary rocks at 433 mbsf in Hole U1546C. In th e recovered igneous rocks, fractures and veins were measured for true dip from whole-round core s before they were split. A total of 49 such structures were identified in Hole U1546C. No veins wer e seen in the igneous rocks at the bottom of Hole U1546A.  

# 4.2.3.4. Biostratigraphy  

At Site U1546, preservation of calcareous nannofossils is good/moderate to poor throughout th e entire sedimentary sequence. In general, nannofossils are abundant and well preserved in th e upper ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ of the sequence. Below $\mathord{\sim}100$ mbsf, intervals with barren/few and common/abundant nannofossils alternate. Preservation is good/moderate in samples with common/abundan t nannofossils and poor in those with few/rare abundances. In general, marine diatoms are dominant/abundant with good/moderate preservation to ${\sim}312$ mbsf and barren to the bottom of Hole s U1546A and U1546C. The lowermost appearance (first appearance datum) of the calcareou s nannofossil $E$ . huxleyi dates the upper part of the sediment sequence to (Holocene–)late–middl e Pleistocene (younger than $0.29\;\mathrm{Ma}$ ; 0–249.28 mbsf in Hole U1546A). In contrast, the absence o f calcareous nannofossil $P_{\star}$ lacunosa and marine diatom $F$ reinholdii in the underlying interval indicates a middle Pleistocene age $(0.29{-}0.44\;\mathrm{Ma})$ for the lower part of Hole U1546A. $P_{\cdot}$ lacunosa wa s observed in the basal core catcher sample from Hole U1546C $^{7}539.84~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ), suggesting an ag e older than the uppermost appearance (last appearance datum [LAD]) of $P_{\cdot}$ lacunosa at $0.44\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . The estimated average sedimentation rate is $1020\;\mathrm{m/My}$ $(102\,\mathrm{cm/ky})$ at this site.

# 4.2.3.5. Paleomagnetism  

AF demagnetization was implemented with the SRM on archive-half sections up to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ on al l cores from Holes U1546A and U1546C. The drilling-induced overprint was successfully remove d from all APC and HLAPC cores (from the seafloor to ${\sim}270~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ) upon demagnetization. In Hol e U1546A, inclination values after demagnetization at $20~\mathrm{mT}$ cluster around $43^{\circ}$ , which is slightl y lower than the expected GAD inclination at the latitude of the site $(46.3^{\circ})$ . A detailed analysis o f the remanence of discrete samples from Hole U1546A showed that the drilling-induced overprin t is removed by $10\;\mathrm{mT}$ and the ChRM agrees with the SRM measurements. Unfortunately, the XC B and RCB cores were irreversibly overprinted. The NRM of archive-half sections decreases at ${\sim}80-$ 100 mbsf (Hole U1546A), a depth interval that corresponds to the SMTZ zone. The magnetic mineral assemblage becomes coarser, and low-coercivity minerals such as (titano)magnetite are dominant. The AF demagnetization protocol was not effective for the igneous rock sections from Hol e U1546C. Therefore, we focused on thermal demagnetization of discrete samples. Two groups o f samples distributed in the sill intrusion were identified: a first group in the upper $18\;\mathrm{m}$ of the sil l contains fine-grained magnetite, and a second group is dominated by coarse-grained titanomagnetite in the bottom $57~\mathrm{m}$ . AMS shows a mixture of prolate and oblate behavior above the sil l and a dominant prolate behavior below it. All cores in Holes U1546A and U1546C were assigne d to the normal Brunhes Chron C1n (younger than $0.78\mathrm{\Ma}_{\prime}$ ). No paleomagnetic measurement s were conducted in Holes U1546B and U1546D.  

# 4.2.3.6. Inorganic geochemistry  

A total of 94 IW samples were collected from the sedimentary succession at Site U1546 (Hole s U1546A–U1546D). Based on the sulfate and methane profiles, the SMTZ is estimated to be a t \~110 mbsf, approximately twice as deep compared to Site U1545. Around this depth, sulfide, alkalinity, and phosphate reach their maximum values and barium concentration starts to increase. However, the depth of maximum concentrations of alkalinity and phosphate is slightly offset fro m the SMTZ. Ammonium gradually increases downhole until an alteration zone above the sediment/sill contact records a drop between 300 and 330 mbsf; its maximal concentration of 12–1 4 mM, compared to over $30~\mathrm{mM}$ at Site U1545, indicates decreased biomineralization of organi c matter. Biogeochemical processes observed from the seafloor to 120 mbsf are mainly related t o anaerobic degradation of organic matter and sulfate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane. Just above and below the sill, a number of significant variations were observed for many IW dissolved elements (such as $\mathsf{K}^{+}$ , B, ${\bf{M}}{\bf{g}}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{Sr^{2+}}$ , $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ , and $\mathrm{\mathbf{B}}\mathrm{\mathbf{a}}^{2+}$ ), which could be related to changes i n mineralogic composition derived from sill-induced alteration. Between the SMTZ and the sil l intrusion, the IW chemical properties are likely to be influenced by combined biogeochemica l processes and sediment-water interaction associated with the sill intrusion and by precipitation/dissolution processes including opal-A dissolution and authigenic carbonate precipitation.  

# 4.2.3.7. Organic geochemistry  

At Site U1546, we sampled and analyzed gas and solid-phase samples. In Holes U1546A–U1546D, one headspace gas sample was analyzed per $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ advance for routine hydrocarbon safety monitoring. The carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents of particulate sediment were characterized, an d source rock analysis was performed on selected solid-phase samples. For the sediments recovere d in Holes U1546B and U1546C, both headspace and void gas were analyzed for their hydrocarbo n contents, the amount of void space was quantified, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO contents were measured, and th e carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents of sediment were characterized. During igneous rock recovery in Hole U1546C, whole-round core pieces of rock were incubated in sealed trilaminated foi l barrier bags to examine degassing of hydrocarbons from freshly recovered whole-round sill cores. In general, methane increases with depth in each hole with 1–2 local maxima. $C_{2}..C_{6}$ hydrocarbons are detectable below ${\sim}90\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , and they all increase with depth. In Hole U1546C, low $C_{1}/C_{2}$ values eventually necessitated the termination of coring. From elemental and source rock analysi s we infer that the primary source of organic matter is marine in origin and the thermal maturity o f organic matter varies based on the proximity of the sill. In Holes U1546B and U1546C, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and C O are present in nanomolar concentrations.  

# 4.2.3.8. Microbiology  

Sediment cores for microbiological studies were obtained from APC, HLAPC, and XCB cores i n Holes U1546B and U1546D. After drilling to 308 mbsf without core recovery, Hole U1546C wa s also sampled along its deeper, hydrothermally heated sediment column above and below the penetrated sill. These Hole U1546C samples represent important horizons that will further our understanding of the impact sill emplacement has on geochemistry and extant microbial communitie s within the hyperthermophilic zone. Syringe samples for cell counts, 3-D structural imaging, an d RNA analyses were taken on the catwalk, fixed or frozen, and stored for further analyses. Wholeround samples were either stored in a $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer or temporarily stored in a cold room $(4^{\circ}{-}8^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and then processed for shore-based analyses, as described for Site U1545. Samples for PFT measurements were taken on the core receiving platform by syringe at 17 horizons. Cell abundance fo r selected samples was determined by direct counting with an epifluorescence microscope. Cel l abundance in seafloor sediment $\mathrm{(1.0\times10^{9}\,c e l l s/c m^{3})}$ ) was roughly 1000 times higher than the bottom seawater $\mathrm{(1.1\times10^{6}\;c e l l s/c m^{3})}$ and gradually decreased to $4.3\times10^{6}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at approximately 13 2 mbsf. In deeper intervals, cell abundance generally dropped below the detection limit of the protocol used for the shipboard cell counting program.  

# 4.2.3.9. Petrophysics  

Physical properties of the recovered cores were measured on whole-round and working-half sections. Downhole wireline logging was used to measure host formation physical properties. Measurements on whole-round and working-half sections from Holes U1546A–U1546D wer e compared with each other and with downhole measurements obtained from Hole U1546C fo r lithostratigraphic characterization and correlation between core description, logging data, an d preexpedition seismic survey profiles. Our analysis identified the same two large-scale majo r petrophysical variations found at Site U1545 and a transition at $\mathord{\sim}280$ mbsf. All physical propertie s highlight the presence of a ${\sim}74~\mathrm{m}$ thick sill at ${\sim}355$ mbsf. Twelve in situ formation temperatur e measurements were conducted using the APCT-3 and SET2 tools. Measured values indicate tha t temperatures increase with depth along a linear geothermal gradient of $221^{\circ}{\mathrm{C}}/{\mathrm{km}}$ that corresponds to a calculated heat flow of $160\ \mathrm{mW/m^{2}}$ . Thermal conductivity varies between ${\sim}0.66$ an d ${\sim}1.00\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ in the first ${\sim}345$ mbsf, which marks the upper sill/sediment contact. Sixteen har d rock thermal conductivity measurements were made on sill samples from $\mathord{\sim}348$ to ${\sim}432$ mbsf, yielding a mean thermal conductivity of $1.72\pm0.14\,\mathrm{W/(m{\cdot}K)}$ . Downhole logging caliper measurements clearly identify the sill–sediment transitions. Bulk density for sediments generally range s from ${\sim}1.2$ to ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ and shows variations in trends at ${\sim}270$ and ${\sim}310$ mbsf. The average sil l density of ${\sim}2.8\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ is typical for doleritic rock. Porosity shows a linear decrease from $90\%$ at th e seafloor to $73\%{-}82\%$ at $\mathord{\sim}309$ mbsf. A significant decrease in sediment porosity was observed a t the top and bottom contacts with the sill. Porosity inside the sill is relatively low $(\sim\!3\%)$ with som e high values in the upper part of the sill. Compressive strength increases by $1.1\ \mathrm{kPa/m},$ and shea r strength increases by $0.6\;\mathrm{kPa/m}$ . NGR values increase from ${\sim}10$ to 25 counts/s to 270 mbsf in th e host sediments; these values then drop inside the sill. Downhole NGR measurements inside the sil l are consistent with whole-round core laboratory measurements. Resistivity measurements revea l large relative variations of 0.4 to ${\sim}200\ \Omega\mathrm{m}$ that typically correlate with variations in density an d porosity. Core-based MS values are mainly constant to ${\sim}355$ mbsf. $P.$ -wave velocity generall y increases with depth and shows typical higher values for the sill.  

# 4.3. Sites U1547 and U1548  

# 4.3.1. Background and objectives  

Sites U1547 and U1548 (proposed Sites GUAYM-12A and GUAYM-03B, respectively) are locate d ${\sim}27~\mathrm{km}$ northwest of the axial graben of the northern Guaymas Basin (Figure F1). Site U1547 lie s within a circular, bowl-shaped hydrothermal mound called Ringvent that rises ${\sim}20\mathrm{~m~}$ above th e seafloor and has a maximum diameter of ${\sim}800\mathrm{~m~}$ . Three holes at Site U1548 (U1548A–U1548C ) lie at the periphery of Ringvent’s southeastern edge, and two holes (U1548D and U1548E) are situated ${\sim}600\;\mathrm{m}$ west-northwest of Ringvent (Figure F7). Seismic profiles across Ringvent show  a prominent subseafloor mound feature at ${\sim}0.06$ s TWT that is characterized by brightly reflectiv e strata within the central bowl-shaped region. A bright reflector underlying the base of the bowl (a t ${\sim}0.18\;s$ TWT) is interpreted to be a sill intrusion. It is hypothesized that this and previous simila r intrusions provided the heat that formed Ringvent and keep it active today. Ringvent is the bestcharacterized active, sill-associated hydrothermal system at an off-axis site in Guaymas Basin, an d the temperature of its vent fluids varies between $20^{\circ}$ and $75\mathrm{^\circC}$ (Teske et al., 2019). Site survey dat a suggest that the central portion of Ringvent may thus function as a hydrothermal recharge zone. Therefore, Sites U1547 and U1548 were intended to core sediments and sills to explore patterns o f hydrothermal circulation at Ringvent, which were suspected to be different within (Site U1547 ) and outside (Holes U1548A–U1548C) of the ring structure. The comparatively hot sill intrusio n setting at Ringvent represents a shallow-emplacement end-member. The primary objectives fo r Sites U1547 and U1548 were thus to characterize the physical, chemical, and biological processe s driven and affected by this end-member type of sill-sediment system, with a particular focus o n the response of microbial communities to the expected steep temperature gradients at these sites. Moreover, two additional holes (U1548D and U1548E) in an area near Ringvent were added to Sit e U1548 during the expedition, with the joint objective of characterizing the geochemical signatur e of the abrupt lateral change in seismic character observed in sediment strata between ${\sim}2.39$ an d 2.42 s TWT, which may be related to a diagenetic change caused by the proximity to the igneou s intrusions at Ringvent.  

# 4.3.2. Operations  

Sites U1547 and U1548 established a total of ten holes within or adjacent to the Ringvent structur e to characterize this hydrothermal mound and its immediate surroundings.

We cored five holes at Site U1547. Hole U1547A is located at $27^{\circ}30.4561\,\mathrm{N}$ , $111^{\circ}40.6980^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in  a water depth of $1733.7\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . In Hole U1547A, we used the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems t o advance from the seafloor to a final depth of 141.3 mbsf with a recovery of $145.3\mathrm{~m~}$ $(103\%)$ . W e made formation temperature measurements at several depths using the APCT-3 and SET2 tools.

We then used th e RCB system to advance from 61.8 mbsf to a final depth of 191.2 mbsf with a recovery of $44.9~\mathrm{m}$ $(35\%)$ . Holes U1547B–U1547D were dedicated to extensive microbial and biogeochemical sampling that required the deployment of PFTs downhole for all cores to monitor drilling fluid (seawater) contamination. A total of $235.0\;\mathrm{h},$ , or 9.8 days, were spent at Site U1547. Table T1 display s cores, penetration depths, core recovery, and operations schedule for all holes of Site U1547.  

Five holes were cored at Site U1548. Hole U1548A is located at $27^{\circ}30.2466\mathrm{\,N}$ , $111^{\circ}40.8665^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in  a water depth of $1739.9\,\mathrm{~m~}$ .

In Hole U1548C, located at $27^{\circ}30.2698\,\mathrm{{N}_{\mathrm{{:}}}}$ , $111^{\circ}40.8476^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in a water depth of $1737.0\;\mathrm{m}$ we deployed the APC and XCB systems to advance from the seafloor to a final depth of 69.8 mbs f with a recovery of $71.0\,\textrm{m}$ $(102\%)$ . We made formation temperature measurements at severa l depths  with  the  APCT-3  and  SET2  tools.  In  Hole  U1548D,  located  at $27^{\circ}30.5316\,\mathrm{N},$ $111^{\circ}41.3855^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in a water depth of $1729.3\;\mathrm{m}$ , we deployed the APC and HLAPC systems.

Holes U1548B and U1548C were dedicated to extensive microbial and biogeochemical sampling that required the deployment of PFTs downhole for all cores to monito r drilling fluid (seawater) contamination. A total of $94.6~\mathrm{h},$ or 3.9 days, were spent at Site U1548. Table T1 displays cores, penetration depths, core recovery, and operations schedule for all holes o f Site U1548.  

# 4.3.3. Principal results  

# 4.3.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

This lithostratigraphic summary characterizes both Site U1547 and Site U1548, which are locate d only a few hundred meters from each other (maximum distance between holes $=\,{\sim}800~\mathrm{m}$ ). Sit e U1547 and Holes U1548A–U1548C were drilled inside or adjacent to the Ringvent structure, an d Holes U1548D and U1548E were drilled ${\sim}600\,\mathrm{~m~}$ west-northwest of Ringvent. The sediment s recovered at Sites U1547 and U1548 are middle to late Pleistocene in age and mostly biogeni c (mainly diatom ooze), although the proportion of siliciclastic components is more significan t compared to Sites U1545 and U1546 in northwest Guaymas Basin (Figures F8, F9, F10). Th e sequence recovered at Sites U1547 and U1548 shows downhole changes in the lithologic characteristics of the sediment that are related to changes in (1) the abundance ratio between diato m ooze and clay minerals, (2) the abundance of carbonate precipitates, and (3) to a lesser extent, th e diagenetic changes of biogenic silica. Downhole changes in lithology at Sites U1547 and U1548 ar e not significant enough to require division into more than one lithostratigraphic unit but are sufficient to warrant the division of Unit I into four subunits at Site U1547 and three subunits at Sit e U1548 (Figures F8, F9, F10). The uppermost subunit (IA) is made up of a similar lithology at bot h sites, mainly consisting of more or less laminated diatom ooze mixed with different amounts o f clay minerals. The boundary between Subunits IA and IB is located at ${\sim}40$ mbsf in holes at bot h sites except in Hole U1548C, where it occurs at ${\sim}27$ mbsf. Subunit IB is mainly composed of varying proportions of diatoms and clay with the addition of significant $(>\!5\%)$ micrite (euhedral t o subhedral, micrometer-sized, authigenic carbonate particles). Gray silty beds, often showing erosional bottom contacts, are also frequent, and some of these beds attain thicknesses of up to $1.2\,\mathrm{m}$ . The top of Subunit IC (only observed in Hole U1548C) is very thin and coincides with a significan t drop in micrite content in the sediment, although limestone/dolostone intervals still persist. Th e main lithologies are diatom clay and clay-rich diatom ooze. Sandy and silty intervals are also common, and some intervals display evidence of syndepositional deformation. Subunit ID was onl y recovered at Site U1547, where it is a dusky yellowish brown siliceous claystone. Diatoms ar e absent, and X-ray diffraction mineralogy indicates the onset of silica phase transition from opal- A to opal-CT. Basalt occurs at shallow depths at Sites U1547 (130.5–150 mbsf) and U1548 (90–10 0 mbsf). However, poor recovery provides only limited observations of contact zones with the adjacent sediment.  

# 4.3.3.2. Igneous petrology and alteration  

Mafic rocks from sill intrusions underlying the Ringvent structure were recovered in Hole s U1547A–U1547E within the circular Ringvent mound and Holes U1548A–U1548C outside of th e Ringvent mound at its periphery. The sill bodies were encountered at different depths and wer e recovered at varying rates. Sills recovered at Site U1547 are mostly composed of aphyric t o clinopyroxene-plagioclase phyric basalt. A ${\sim}20\mathrm{~m~}$ thick doleritic section was recovered from th e bottom part of Hole U1547E (to 191 mbsf) and includes plagioclase and pyroxene phenocrysts $2-$ $5\;\mathrm{mm}$ in size. The basaltic material is slightly to moderately vesicular, whereas doleritic interval s are nonvesicular to slightly vesicular. The subangular to subrounded vesicles range from 1 to 2 5 mm in diameter. Vesicles are either empty or partially/fully filled with carbonate that is often associated with pyrite $(<\!0.5\ \mathrm{mm})$ ). Empty vesicles are often coated with secondary bluish gray silicat e material. The recovered basalts show variable degrees of alteration. Monomineralic carbonat e veins are often surrounded by thin halos of pyrite. Occasionally, the latter also occurs as subordinate vein-filling material. In terms of modal composition, basalts recovered at Site U1548 resemble those from Site U1547, but they are darker in color and usually nonvesicular. Other commo n features observed in igneous rock cores from Holes U1547A–U1547E and U1548A–U1548C ar e injected sedimentary veins, contacts between sedimentary breccia and basalt, sediment-magm a mingling (peperite facies), and glassy chilled margins. The presence of glassy chilled margins suggests direct contact of the magma with very wet sediment. Chemical data obtained from Sit e

U1547 sill intervals overall reveal a subalkaline, tholeiitic mafic rock chemistry, with few sample s from Holes U1547D and U1547E showing a calc-alkaline character. Based on their Ti-V pattern, al l rock samples point to an enriched MORB composition.  

# 4.3.3.3. Structural geology  

We made structural observations in all ten holes within (Site U1547) or near (Site U1548) th e Ringvent structure. Structural information was sought from sedimentary units in four of the fiv e holes at Site U1547 and all five holes at Site U1548. Hole U1547A was lithologically the most complete hole for examining the sedimentary succession. Bedding and lamination in sediments sho w no significant folds and few brittle fractures and faults, although in some cases fractures are see n much more easily in the X-ray images than on the cut surfaces of the cores. Additional structura l information came from the basaltic rocks in Subunit ID, which were cored in eight of the holes. Holes U1547B, U1547D, and U1547E recovered the most mafic hypabyssal rock. Structural features observed in the basaltic rocks include preexisting fractures and faults, mineralized veins, glassy margins, sediment-filled veins, and fragments of columnar joints. Where possible, thes e features were measured for true dip and await possible reorientation using shore-based paleomagnetic results. Networks of veins with irregular branching patterns were not measured as planar features. No macroscopic shortening or folding of the veins was evident.  

# 4.3.3.4. Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossils are abundant to common above 43.51 mbsf at Site U1547 and in Hole s U1548A–U1548C. This interval is followed by an alternation between intervals with few or barre n occurrences of nannofossils and intervals with abundant/common populations from 43.73 t o 151.93 mbsf at both sites. Nannofossil preservation varies from good to poor throughout th e entire sedimentary sequence and is generally good and moderate in samples with abundant an d common abundances and poor in those with few and barren abundances. In general, marine diatoms are dominant and abundant with good to moderate preservation above 131.21 mbsf in Hol e U1547A, above 101.15 mbsf in Hole U1547B, above 81.6 mbsf in Hole U1547C, and above 91.2 5 mbsf in Hole U1547D. The barren intervals at the bottom of Site U1547 and in Holes U1548A– U1548C might be due to diagenetic alteration. In Hole U1548A, marine diatoms are mostly abundant with moderate preservation above 84.1 mbsf, whereas they are abundant to few and poorl y preserved in the bottom interval (90.9–99.0 mbsf). In Holes U1548D and U1548E, calcareou s nannofossils are common to abundant with moderate and poor preservation in most sample s examined, except for those from three sampled depths (31, 92.29, and $101.58\,\mathrm{\mbsf})$ ) in Hol e U1548D. Marine diatoms are dominant and abundant with good and moderate preservatio n throughout Holes U1548D and U1548E. The occurrence of calcareous nannofossil species $E$ . huxleyi to the bottom of all holes dates the entire sediment sequence to (Holocene–)late–middl e Pleistocene, or younger than $0.29\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Hole $\mathrm{U}1547\mathrm{A}\,=\,0{-}137$ mbsf, Hole $\mathrm{U}1547\mathrm{B}\,=\,0{-}151.93$ mbsf, Hole $\mathrm{U}1547\mathrm{C}=0{-}121.13$ mbsf, Hole $\mathrm{U1547D}=0{-}101.33\,\mathrm{mbs}$ f, Hole $\mathrm{U}1548\mathrm{A}=0{-}99$ mbsf, Hole $\mathrm{U1548D}=0{\--110.24\,\mathrm{mbsf}},$ and Hole $\mathrm{U}1548\mathrm{E}=0{-}91.81$ mbsf). This age assignment is consistent with the absence of calcareous nannofossil species $P_{\cdot}$ lacunosa $\mathrm{(LAD=0.44\Ma)}$ ) and ${\cal F}$ reinholdii $\mathrm{\left(LAD=0.62\,Ma\right)}$ in all examined samples. The estimated average sedimentation rate is ${>}524$ $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{M}\mathbf{y}$ $(>52.4\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ .  

# 4.3.3.5. Paleomagnetism  

AF demagnetization up to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ was conducted with the SRM on all sediment archive-half sections from Holes U1547A, U1548A, and U1548C–U1548E (APC, HLAPC, and XCB cores). Th e drilling-induced overprint was successfully removed from all cores upon demagnetization. Mea n inclination values after demagnetization at $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ cluster around $46^{\circ}$ at Site U1547 (Hole U1547A ) and vary between ${\sim}40^{\circ}$ and $47^{\circ}$ at Site U1548, values that are comparable to the expected GA D inclination at the latitude of the sites $(46.2^{\circ})$ . A detailed analysis of the remanence of discrete samples from Sites U1547 and U1548 shows that the drilling-induced overprint is removed by $10\;\mathrm{mT}$ and the ChRM is in accordance with the SRM measurements. The NRM of archive-half section s decreases at ${\sim}30{-}35$ mbsf in Holes U1547A and U1548A and at ${\sim}65{-}70$ mbsf in Holes U1548 D and U1548E. The magnetic mineral assemblage becomes coarser, and low-coercivity minerals, likely (titano)magnetite, are dominant. The AMS of sediments in Holes U1547A, U1548A, an d U1548C–U1548E shows a mixture of prolate, oblate, and triaxial behavior in the vast majority o f sampled depths. The igneous rock archive-half sections from Holes U1547B–U1547E, U1548A, and U1548C were measured for their NRM only because the AF demagnetization protocol wa s not effective for the igneous sections. All cores at Sites U1547 and U1548 were assigned to th e normal Brunhes Chron C1n (younger than $0.78\,\mathrm{Ma}_{\mathrm{,}}$ ).  

# 4.3.3.6. Inorganic geochemistry  

A total of 32 IW samples were collected from the sediment columns in Holes U1547A an d U1547B, and 68 were collected from the sedimentary successions in Holes U1548A–U1548E. I n addition, 27 and 20 IW samples from sediments in Hole U1547A and Hole U1548A, respectively, were collected using Rhizon samplers. The holes at Sites U1547 and U1548 are divided into thre e groups: holes inside (U1547A–U1547E), peripheral to (U1548A–U1548C), and nearby (U1548 D and U1548E) Ringvent. Above the encountered sills at Ringvent, the IW profiles show simila r trends in all Site U1547 holes and in Holes U1548A–U1548C, with slight differences mainly i n sulfate, alkalinity, phosphate, and sulfide concentrations. Alkalinity $({\sim}13{-}18~\mathrm{mM})$ and ammoni a concentration maxima $({\sim}4{-}9~\mathrm{mM})$ in these holes are consistently the lowest of this expedition, indicating reduced biomineralization in sediments above the Ringvent sill. Abrupt changes wer e observed for many elements in the contact interval with the sill, suggesting that the sill acts as  a source or sink: sulfate sharply decreases to depletion over a few meters coincident with increase s in $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ , $\mathrm{\bfBa}^{2+}$ , B, $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ , $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ , and $\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}$ and decreases in ${\bf{M}}{\bf{g}}^{2+}$ , $\!\mathrm{K}^{+}$ , and $\mathrm{H}_{4}\mathrm{SiO}_{4}$ . Similar excursions wer e observed at Sites U1545 and U1546 above the sills. The IW chemical properties are likely influenced by sediment-fluid interaction associated with the sill intrusion, and by precipitation/dissolution processes associated with sediment diagenesis, including opal-A dissolution and to a lesse r extent by combined biogeochemical processes. Northwest of Ringvent, the IW profiles in Hole s U1548D and U1548E behave differently compared to the holes located inside Ringvent. In general, concentrations of alkalinity, $\Sigma\mathsf{H}_{2}S$ , $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ , and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ produced by organic matter mineralization ar e higher in Holes U1548D and U1548E than in Ringvent Holes U1548A–U1548C. The SMTZ i n Holes U1548D and U1548E is well defined around 76 mbsf by a concave downward decrease i n sulfate and a concomitant increase in alkalinity, $\mathrm{H}S^{-}$ , $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ , and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ . Compared to the Ringven t holes, the lower concentrations of dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{4}\mathrm{SiO}_{4}$ in Holes U1548D and U1548E may reflect les s alteration of silicate minerals or diatom tests due to the lower thermal gradient.  

# 4.3.3.7. Organic geochemistry  

At Sites U1547 and U1548, organic geochemists sampled and analyzed gas and solid-phase samples. For all holes, one headspace gas sample was analyzed per $9.5~\mathrm{m}$ of advancement for routin e hydrocarbon safety monitoring. Void spaces were measured on the core receiving platform, an d void gases were characterized for their hydrocarbon content. The carbon, nitrogen, and sulfu r contents of particulate sediment were characterized, and source rock analysis was performed o n selected solid-phase samples. When sampling was focused on microbiology and biogeochemistr y objectives, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO contents were measured and gas and solid-phase materials were sample d for shore-based analyses. Headspace analyses of sediment and rock samples for methane an d hydrocarbons yielded high concentrations that increased from the sediment column toward sil l interfaces. ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ concentrations reached a maximum of $125\,\mathrm{\mM}$ at the sill interface in Hol e U1547B and often exceeded $10\,\mathrm{mM}$ when small pieces of sill rock were used for headspace incubations during igneous rock recovery. To further examine these results, pieces of rock from wholeround cores were incubated in sealed trilaminated foil barrier bags to examine degassing o f hydrocarbons. Methane and higher hydrocarbons were found in high concentrations throughou t Sites U1547 and U1548. Concentrations in sill rock depend strongly on rock density and porespac e assumptions; with an average density of $2.7\ \mathrm{g/ml}$ and $14\%$ porespace, methane concentration s would range approximately from 30 to $140\;\mathrm{mM}$ at Site U1547 (Holes U1547B–U1547E) and up t o $35\;\mathrm{mM}$ at Site U1548 (Holes U1548A–U1548C). Using the same assumptions, hydrogen concentrations in sills would range mostly between 2 and $20\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ with occasionally higher values. Elemental analysis revealed that organic matter at these sites originates primarily from marine sources, although some intervals may be influenced by terrestrial inputs. Source rock analysis indicate d that thermal maturity of organic matter varies based on sill proximity. In sediment pore water profiles, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO show nanomolar concentrations and exhibit varying trends with depth.  

# 4.3.3.8. Microbiology  

The Ringvent sites present an opportunity to investigate the microbial consequences of elevate d heat flow and hydrothermal circulation at Guaymas Basin off-axis sites. Previous sequencing studies of shallow piston-cored sediments from Ringvent revealed decreased microbial diversity an d remnant populations of past methane seepage (Teske et al., 2019; Ramírez et al., 2020). Sedimen t cores for microbiological studies were obtained from Holes U1547B, U1548B, and U1548C usin g the APC and XCB systems. In addition, samples of igneous rock with indications of fluid-roc k interaction, such as veins, sediment injections, and vesicularity with amygdules, were taken fo r microbiological studies from Holes U1547C–U1547E, U1548A, and U1548B. Syringe samples fo r cell counts, 3-D structural imaging, and RNA analyses were taken on the core receiving platform, preserved or frozen, and stored for further analyses. Whole-round core samples were either store d in a $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer or temporarily stored in a $4^{\circ}{-}8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ cold room and processed further for shorebased analyses, as described for Site U1545. Samples for PFT measurements were taken on th e core receiving platform by syringe from eight Hole U1547B cores and four Hole U1548B cores. Cell abundance was $1.0\,\times\,10^{9}$ cells $\scriptstyle\mathbf{Cm}^{3}$ in seafloor sediment within the perimeter of Ringven t (Hole U1547B) and $5.4\,\times\,10^{8}~\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ just outside of Ringvent (Hole U1548B). Cell abundanc e quickly decreased downhole at both Site U1547 ( $1.4\times10^{6}$ cells/cm3 at approximately 66 mbsf) an d Site U1548 $1.3\times10^{6}$ cells $\scriptstyle\mathbf{Cm}^{3}$ at approximately 57.7 mbsf in Holes U1548A–U1548C). Except fo r a few localized spikes, cells were not detected in deeper samples. These shallow depth limits fo r cell detection at Ringvent contrast with considerably deeper cell detection depths at Sites U154 5 and U1546.

Physical properties measured on whole-round and split core sections from Holes U1547A– U1547E and U1548A–U1548E were compared with each other and with downhole logging measurements from Hole U1547B for lithostratigraphic characterization and correlation between cor e description, logging data, and preexpedition seismic survey profiles. At Sites U1547 and U1548,  a total of 31 in situ formation temperature measurements were taken with the APCT-3 and SET 2 tools. The resulting geothermal gradient of ${\sim}511^{\circ}$ to almost $960^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ as well as thermal conductivity measurements were used to calculate a heat flow that varies between ${\sim}520$ and ${\sim}930$ $\mathrm{{mW/m^{2}}}$ , depending on the vicinity to the Ringvent mound. Conductivity measurements at Sit e U1548 show values in the sediment layers that are similar to those at Site U1547. Sites U1547 an d U1548 show similar profiles for density, porosity, strength, NGR, MS, and $P.$ -wave velocity in th e upper $90\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment. Petrophysical variations highlight the main lithostratigraphic changes a t Site U1548 through correlated variations in density and NGR values. Mafic sill material recovere d from Site U1547 shows thick continuous intrusion sheets across the transect of its boreholes, an d no bottom contact to the underlying sediment was encountered.  

# 4.4. Site U1549  

# 4.4.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1549 (proposed Site GUAYM-16A) is located ${\sim}9.5~\mathrm{km}$ northwest of the northern axial graben of Guaymas Basin (Figure F1) and ${\sim}780\,\mathrm{m}$ northwest of a mound-shaped seafloor feature (Figure F11) where active cold-seep communities were documented by preexpedition site survey s (Teske et al., 2021). In addition, seismic data at this location were interpreted to show an underlying sill at ${\sim}450$ mbsf and indicate gas movement along and around a pipe structure (Figure F11). This association of a relatively deep sill, active gas venting, and seafloor communities connect s multiple components of the carbon budget of a sill-driven vent/seep system. The sedimentary setting at Site U1549 is intermediate between the biogenic-dominated sedimentation observed a t Sites U1545 and U1546 and the dominantly terrigenous deposition documented southeast of th e northern axial graben (Site U1551). The primary objectives for Site U1549 are thus to characteriz e the physical, chemical, and microbial properties of this sedimentologically intermediate settin g and to assess the influence of the underlying sill and associated altered sediments on carbo n cycling in the subseafloor.  

# 4.4.2. Operations  

Two holes were cored at Site U1549. Hole U1549A is located at $27^{\circ}28.3317^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , 111°28.7844ʹW in  a water depth of $1840.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . In Hole U1549A, we used the APC system to advance from the seafloo r to a final depth of 168.0 mbsf with a recovery of $166.9\;\mathrm{m}\;(99\%)$ . We made formation temperatur e measurements at several depths using the APCT-3 tool. In Hole U1549B, located at $27^{\circ}28.3383\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ,  

111°28.7927ʹW in a water depth of $1841.2\;\mathrm{m};$ , we deployed the APC system. Cores penetrated fro m the seafloor to a final depth of 166.9 mbsf and recovered $164.4~\mathrm{m}$ $(99\%)$ . Hole U1549B was dedicated to extensive microbial and biogeochemical sampling that required the deployment of PFT s downhole for all cores to monitor drilling fluid (seawater) contamination. The pace of coring i n Hole U1549B was adjusted to accommodate the complex microbial sampling program conducte d on the core receiving platform. A total of $51.1\,\mathrm{h}$ , or 2.1 days, were spent at Site U1549. An overvie w of cores, penetration depths, core recovery, and operations schedule for Site U1549 is given i n Table T1.  

# 4.4.3. Principal results  

# 4.4.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The sediments recovered at Site U1549 are late to middle Pleistocene in age and are mostly biogenic (mainly diatom ooze) with a significant $(\sim\!10\%)$ proportion of sand- to silt-sized siliciclasti c components that occur either mixed with the biogenic component or concentrated in discret e laminae and beds (Figure F12). No major diagenetic changes were observed, probably because o f the relatively shallow subseafloor depth reached at this site, leading to the characterization of  a single lithostratigraphic unit (Unit I). The most common lithology observed is olive-gray, clay- t o silt-rich diatom ooze. Unlike what was observed in the northwestern (Sites U1545 and U1546) an d Ringvent (Sites U1547 and U1548) sediment successions, the diatom ooze is primarily nonlaminated. The terrigenous-dominated depositional layers that are intercalated with diatom ooz e range from a few centimeters to a meter thick with sharp bases that are locally marked by a coarse r basal lamina of silt- to sand-sized bioclasts (foraminifers and small bivalves). The thickest bed s occasionally have a base of laminated, bioclastic sand with a few coarse siliciclastic particles. Othe r coarse siliciclastic (silt- to sand-sized) depositional layers were also recognized, and they rang e from laminae of a few millimeters thick to beds as thick as $\sim\!6\;\mathrm{m}$ . The thickest of these beds ar e normally graded and associated with basal sand to silty sand that shows scouring at the base. Fou r exceptionally thick, normally graded terrigenous depositional layers were noted in the lithologi c succession. Three of these beds were clearly correlated between Holes U1549A and U1549B an d show a characteristic increase in NGR, MS, and color parameter $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ . The depositional layers composed of homogeneous biogenic and siliciclastic components are interpreted to be the products o f slope instability and mass-gravity deposition, including hybrid flows.

# 4.4.3.2. Structural geology  

Structural information was obtained from sedimentary sequences at Site U1549. None of the samples were sufficiently lithified to be measured independently as whole-round pieces. Tilted laminae seen in Cores 385-U1549A-2H and 3H suggest small-scale slump folds, but the rest of Hole s U1549A and U1549B mostly have laminae that are roughly perpendicular to the axis of the hole. One chevron fold with a horizontal fold axis was found in interval 385-U1549A-3H-1, 42–47 c m $({\sim}16.4{-}16.5~\mathrm{mbsf})$ . Tilted bedding was noted starting in Section 16H-1 (139.5 mbsf) and continues to deeper levels in Cores 17H and 18H with values typically from $10^{\circ}$ to $15^{\circ}$ . A few brittle fault s were seen at different depths in the section, but overall there is much less faulting in this sedimentary section than at Ringvent Sites U1547 and U1548, northern rift Site U1550, and northwester n Guaymas Basin Sites U1545 and U1546.  

# 4.4.3.3. Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossils are abundant to common with good/moderate preservation throughou t the entire sampled sequence at Site U1549, and the barren interval seen at Sites U1545–U1548 i s not present at this site. Reworked nannofossils include a significant component of Miocene tax a with a greatly reduced contribution of reworked Cretaceous specimens. In general, marine diatoms are dominant to abundant with good/moderate preservation throughout Hole U1549A, except at 63.62 and 71.23 mbsf, where diatoms have a common abundance. Freshwater diatoms i n Hole U1549A are much more frequent than at the northwestern and Ringvent sites, particularly a t similar depths. This suggests strong influence of terrestrial input. No evidence of diagenetic alteration of diatoms is present in Hole U1549A. The occurrence of $E_{\mathrm{{}}}$ . huxleyi from the top to th e bottom of the hole dates the entire sediment sequence to (Holocene–)late–middle Pleistocene, o r younger than $0.29\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Hole $\mathrm{U1549A=0{-}168.35\,m b s f)}$ . This age assignment is consistent with th e absence of $P_{\cdot}$ lacunosa $\left(\mathrm{LAD}=0.44\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ and $F$ reinholdii $\left(\mathrm{LAD}=0.62\ \mathrm{Ma}\right)$ in all examined samples. The estimated average sedimentation rate is >580 m/My $(>58.0\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ .

# 4.4.3.4. Paleomagnetism  

AF demagnetization up to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ was performed on archive-half sections with the SRM on al l APC sediment cores from Hole U1549A. The drilling-induced overprint was successfully remove d from all cores (from the seafloor to $\mathord{\sim}168$ mbsf) upon demagnetization. Inclination values afte r demagnetization at $20\,\mathrm{mT}$ cluster around $46^{\circ}$ , which corresponds to the expected GAD inclinatio n at the latitude of the site (46.1°). A detailed analysis of the remanence of discrete samples fro m Hole U1549A shows that the drilling-induced overprint is removed by $10\;\mathrm{mT}$ and the ChRM is i n accordance with the SRM measurements. The NRM of archive-half sections is higher at $\mathord{\sim}16\mathrm{-}19$ , ${\sim}69.5{-}70,$ , and 79.5–80 mbsf. These intervals correspond to sandy layers that contain more detrita l material. Hole U1549A cores were assigned to the normal Brunhes Chron C1n (younger than 0.7 8 Ma). The AMS obtained from Hole U1549A sediments is characterized by a mixture of prolat e and oblate behavior. No paleomagnetic measurements were carried out in Hole U1549B.  

# 4.4.3.5. Inorganic geochemistry  

To examine biogeochemical profiles associated with microbial diagenesis in greater resolution, th e total of 65 IW samples that were collected by hydraulic pressing of sedimentary whole-round cor e samples (35 from the seafloor to $160~\mathrm{mbsf})$ were supplemented by Rhizon sampling of freshl y recovered core sections spaced at approximately $^{1\,}\mathbf{m}$ intervals (30 from the seafloor to 30 mbsf i n Hole U1549A). Based on the sulfate profiles, the SMTZ is estimated at 30 mbsf in Hole U1549 A and 25 mbsf in Hole U1549B, considerably shallower compared to Sites U1545 and U1546. Belo w the SMTZ around 100 mbsf, alkalinity reaches a high maximum value of $85\;\mathrm{mM}$ and ammoniu m reaches maximum concentrations near $15~\mathrm{mM}$ . $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ has a higher concentration than seawate r $(53.5\;\mathrm{mM})$ , and its maximum value reaches $65~\mathrm{mM}$ below the SMTZ. In addition, downhole concentration profiles of $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ , B, and $\mathrm{H}_{4}\mathrm{SiO}_{4}$ generally display an increasing trend with higher value s than those of seawater. The IW chemical signatures at Site U1549 may be predominantly influenced by organic matter degradation related to microbial processes and by sediment-water interactions and mineral precipitation/dissolution processes.  

# 4.4.3.6. Organic geochemistry  

At Site U1549, organic geochemists performed sampling and analysis of gas and solid-phase samples. In Hole U1549A, one headspace gas sample was analyzed per $9.5\,\textrm{m}$ advance for routin e hydrocarbon safety monitoring, void gases were quantified and sampled for hydrocarbon content, and the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents of particulate sediment were characterized. In Hol e U1549B, hydrocarbon analyses were performed on headspace gas; $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO contents were measured; sediment carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents were characterized; and a comprehensiv e suite of gas and sediment samples was taken for postexpedition analyses. Methane appears belo w ${\sim}25~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , and $C_{2}-C_{6}$ hydrocarbons are all detectable at depths below 60 mbsf. No anomalou s $C_{1}/C_{2}$ values were observed. From elemental analysis, we inferred that the primary source o f organic matter is marine in origin. In Hole U1549B, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO are present in low concentrations, which suggests that biological cycling is the dominant control on these gases.  

# 4.4.3.7. Microbiology  

Hole U1549B samples represent horizons that inform our understanding of the cycle of carbo n driven by fluid flow in the Guaymas Basin subseafloor. Site U1549 is effectively a cold-seep sit e characterized by mass-gravity flows. Thus, the site has a relatively high proportion of terrigenou s material and an attenuated thermal gradient that indicates relatively moderate hydrotherma l warming. As such, it provides an opportunity for microbiologists to examine the influence of thes e gravity flows on in situ microbial diversity and on activities within a hydrothermal setting distal t o the immediate influences of emplaced sills and/or extremely hot hydrothermal fluids. Syring e samples for cell counts, 3-D structural imaging, and RNA analyses were taken on the core receiving platform, preserved or frozen, and stored for further analyses. Whole-round core sample s were either stored in a $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer or temporarily stored in a $4^{\circ}{-}8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ cold room and processe d further for shore-based analyses, as described for Site U1545. Samples for PFT measurement s were taken on the core receiving platform using a syringe at six distinct horizons. Cell abundanc e for selected samples was determined by direct counting with an epifluorescence microscope. Cel l abundance was $0.94\times10^{6}$ cells $\scriptstyle\mathrm{(cm^{3}}$ in bottom seawater and $6.3\times10^{8}$ cells $^{\prime}\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in seafloor sediments. Cell abundance gradually decreased to below the detection limit of the protocol used fo r shipboard measurements at approximately 124 mbsf, twice as deep as at Ringvent (Holes U1547B, U1548A, and U1548C).  

# 4.4.3.8. Petrophysics  

Physical properties measured on whole-round and working-half sections from Holes U1549A an d U1549B were compared for lithostratigraphic characterization and correlation of visual cor e description with physical properties. Four in situ formation temperature measurements wer e taken with the APCT-3 tool to calculate the geothermal gradient $(194^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km})$ and heat flow (14 4 $\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2})$ ). Conductivity measurements show a similar trend with depth in Holes U1549A an d U1549B. We have identified one main interval that correlates with Lithostratigraphic Unit I. NG R and MS peaks at ${\sim}70{-}100$ mbsf correlate with four depositional subunits. These physical properties along with density and $P$ -wave velocity values have a negative correlation with porosity values. Thus, porosity values derived from MAD measurements show a general decrease with depth. I n contrast, shear strength measurements show a linear increase due to the presence of indurate d sediments at depth.  

# 4.5. Site U1550  

# 4.5.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1550 (proposed Site GUAYM-06B) is located within the axial graben of the northern Guaymas Basin spreading segment (Figures F1, F13). This site was established very close to DSDP Sit e 481 to take advantage of the known presence, depth, and characteristics of sills and indurated sediments at Site 481 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1982), and to clarify its stratigraphy by redrilling i t with improved coring tools and sampling approaches. Substantially improved recovery wa s expected relative to Site 481, leading to increased sampling resolution of downhole changes an d enabling the use of modern microbiological approaches. The fault-bounded setting of Site U155 0 provides the potential for high-flux fluid circulation in response to sill intrusion, leading to swif t cooling and potentially enhanced alteration due to the rapid removal of dissolved phases an d gases. The primary objectives for Site U1550 are to characterize the physical, chemical, and microbial responses to sill intrusion into sediments at a high-flux end-member location.

We cored two holes at Site U1550. Hole U1550A is located at $27^{\circ}15.1602\,\mathrm{N},$ , $111^{\circ}30.4163^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in  a water depth of $2000.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . In Hole U1550A, we used the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems t o advance from the seafloor to a final depth of 207.0 mbsf with a recovery of $190.9\mathrm{~m~}$ $(92\%)$ . W e made formation temperature measurements at several depths with the APCT-3 and SET2 tools. I n Hole U1550B, located at $27^{\circ}15.1704\mathrm{\,N}$ , $111^{\circ}30.4451^{\prime}\mathbb{W}$ in a water depth of $2001.2\;\mathrm{m}_{:}$ , we deploye d the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems. Cores penetrated from the seafloor to a final depth of 174. 2 mbsf and recovered $160.8\mathrm{~m~}(92\%)$ . Hole U1550B was dedicated to extensive microbial and biogeochemical sampling that required the deployment of PFTs downhole on all cores to monito r drilling fluid (seawater) contamination. The pace of coring in Hole U1550B was adjusted t o accommodate the complex microbial sampling program conducted on the core receiving platform. A total of $72.0\ \mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , or 3.0 days, were spent at Site U1550. Table T1 provides an overview o f cores, penetration depths, core recovery, and operations schedule for Site U1550.  

# 4.5.3. Principal results  

# 4.5.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

At Site U1550, a succession of sediments, sedimentary rocks, and igneous rocks was recovere d (Figure F14). The sedimentary material recovered can mainly be ascribed to two lithologic types: (1) a biogenic-dominated type, in which more or less laminated olive-gray diatom clays occu r mixed with various proportions of nannofossils and silt-sized siliciclastic particles, or (2)  a siliciclastic-dominated type in which coarse-grained siliciclastic components (sand and silt), cla y minerals, and subordinate diatoms occur either mixed in homogeneous layers or segregated i n depositional layers often characterized by graded beds and scoured bases. Most of the thickes t graded terrigenous layers identified are traced between holes. Vertical changes in the character o f the dominant lithology, the style of bedding and/or deformation, and the diagenetic boundarie s prompted the subdivision of Unit I into three subunits. Subunit IA includes three thick terrigenous beds and displays evidence of soft-sediment deformation. The lower part of the subunit i n both holes is marked by a lithologically complex but correlative interval that includes a large concentration of silt- to granule-sized scoria fragments. Subunit IB is mainly composed of varyin g proportions of diatoms, clay, and silt, with sand occurring as a minor component. The upper par t of the subunit contains a very distinctive, $\mathord{\sim}18\;\mathrm{m}$ thick, homogeneous interval composed of olivegreen diatom clay. There are pronounced differences in Subunit IC between holes. In Hol e U1550A, the top of this subunit corresponds to the first appearance of carbonates (micrite/nodules). The latter occur scattered in diatom clay or as cementing crystals in coarser grained (sand t o silt) lithologies. Folding and tilting are common as well as the presence of coarser grained beds, including a fourth thick terrigenous bed (Figure F14). Low diatom abundance and preservatio n support the XRD analysis interpretation that the sediments have undergone silica diagenesis an d the transition from opal-A to opal-CT. In Hole U1550B, Subunit IC was identified in only thre e cores that are mainly composed of organic-rich, yellowish brown homogeneous diatom clay wit h evidence of soft-sediment deformation. The sediments recovered at Site U1550 display a variety o f sedimentary features, including graded beds with scoured bases ranging from a few centimeters t o several meters thick, tilted and/or folded beds or laminae, and chaotic fabric. Taken together, thes e features are direct evidence that deposition at this site occurred mainly by means of mass-gravit y flow events.

# 4.5.3.2. Igneous petrology and alteration  

The dominant hypabyssal igneous lithology recovered from the bottom of both Hole U1550 A (upper contact at ${\sim}204$ mbsf with ${\sim}1.2~\mathrm{m}$ recovered) and Hole U1550B (upper contact at ${\sim}170$ mbsf with ${\sim}1.6\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered) is mafic rock with a largely doleritic texture. Minor basaltic roc k intervals with a sparsely to highly plagioclase-phyric texture occasionally occur. Notably, there is  a gradual change in grain size transitioning from basaltic to doleritic texture within a distance of  a few centimeters, indicating slow magma solidification. Nevertheless, there are also angular fragments of doleritic material entrapped in basaltic rock intervals in Hole U1550B. The slightly t o moderately altered igneous rocks are nonvesicular to sparsely vesicular and contain multiple, slightly dipping calcite veinlets running parallel to each other. Samples obtained from this sill sho w a subalkaline, tholeiitic mafic rock chemistry that corresponds to an enriched MORB composition. These rocks appear to represent somewhat more evolved melts based on their lower $\mathrm{Mg}^{\#}$ compared to the sill material recovered from nearby DSDP Site 481.  

# 4.5.3.3. Structural geology  

Both Holes U1550A and U1550B exhibit folding and tilted bedding starting at 15 mbsf and continuing intermittently below. These displacements are attributed to soft-sediment deformatio n and slumping because they are variable on a small spatial scale. Significant faults are seen in bot h holes at about 130–140 mbsf, where sets of parallel faults with apparent dips of about $60^{\circ}$ displac e the sediment. These faults have a spacing of $0.2–1\;\mathrm{m}$ in the cores, but the amount and direction o f displacement is unknown. The faults indicate an episode of deformation that occurred prior to th e time of deposition of sediments that are now found at about 130 mbsf.  

# 4.5.3.4. Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossils are abundant and common to 123.08 mbsf, rare/barren from 131.06 t o 135.6 mbsf, and resume abundant and common occurrences from $142.02$ to 187.66 mbsf. Nannofossil preservation is good/moderate throughout the entire sedimentary sequence. Marine diatoms are dominant to abundant with good/moderate preservation in the upper interval of Hol e U1550A (0–72.51 mbsf). They alternate between abundant, common, and few with moderate t o poor preservation at an intermediate depth range (81.02–123.08 mbsf), and range from few to rar e and barren with poor preservation in the lowermost interval (131.06–200.55 mbsf). Apparent diagenetic alteration of diatoms is present in samples with rare diatoms at the bottom of Hol e U1550A. The diatom assemblages are obviously different from Sites U1545, U1546, U1547, an d U1548, possibly suggesting strong disturbance of sedimentation sequences by underwater massflow events. The occurrence of calcareous nannofossil $E_{\mathrm{{*}}}$ . huxleyi from the top to the bottom o f both holes dates the entire sediment sequence to (Holocene–)late–middle Pleistocene, or younge r than $0.29\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Ho $|\mathrm{e}\,\mathrm{U}1550\mathrm{A}=0{-}200.55\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ . This age assignment is consistent with the absenc e of $P_{\cdot}$ lacunosa $\left(\mathrm{LAD}=0.44\mathrm{~Ma}\right)$ and ${\cal F}$ reinholdii $\left(\mathrm{LAD}=0.62\ \mathrm{Ma}\right)$ in all samples examined. Th e estimated average sedimentation rate is >692 m/My $(>69.2\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ ).  

# 4.5.3.5. Paleomagnetism  

AF demagnetization up to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ was carried out with the SRM on archive-half sections on al l sediment cores from Hole U1550A (Cores 1H–29X). The drilling-induced overprint was successfully removed from APC and HLAPC cores (from the seafloor to ${\sim}130~\mathrm{mbsf}]$ ) upon demagnetization. Inclination values after demagnetization at $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ cluster around $46^{\circ}$ , which is comparable t o the expected GAD inclination at the latitude of the site $(45.9^{\circ})$ . A detailed analysis of the remanence of discrete samples from Hole U1550A shows that the drilling-induced overprint wa s removed by $10\;\mathrm{mT},$ and the ChRM agrees with the SRM measurements. Unfortunately, XCB core s were overprinted and too disturbed to yield reliable paleomagnetic data. Nevertheless, three discrete samples were collected in XCB cores and their inclination values are consistent with what i s expected. Thus, Hole U1550A cores were assigned to the normal Brunhes Chron C1n (younge r than $0.78\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ). Discrete sedimentary samples taken in Hole U1550A predominantly show prolat e behavior throughout the hole with the $K_{\mathrm{max}}$ principal axis of AMS distributed in the horizonta l plane. The archive-half sections containing igneous rocks (Cores 385-U1550A-30X through 32 X and Cores 385-U1550B-22X through 23X) were only measured for their NRM because AF demagnetization treatment was not effective.  

# 4.5.3.6. Inorganic geochemistry  

A total of 42 IW samples were collected from the sedimentary succession at Site U1550. Th e SMTZ at this site is located at ${\sim}10$ mbsf, one of the shallowest SMTZs encountered during thi s expedition. The IW chemical properties show spatial and vertical heterogeneities, exhibiting differences between Holes U1550A and U1550B (e.g., alkalinity, ammonium, $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ , and B) an d changing significantly between the upper and lower parts of the sediment succession throughou t both holes. In the upper part of Site U1550 $(0{-}40\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ , alkalinity reaches very high values up t o $90\;\mathrm{mM}$ , and $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ accumulates to values higher than seawater concentration, whereas $C a^{2+}$ show s a decreasing trend due to authigenic carbonate precipitation. Ammonium shows local peaks at 2 5 mbsf and around $100~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , with the upper peak stronger in Hole U1550A and the deeper on e stronger in Hole U1550B. Below $100\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , alkalinity and $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ decrease with depth, and $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ , $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ , and $\mathrm{H}_{4}\mathrm{SiO}_{4}$ concentrations increase with depth. These elements show remarkable excursion s above the sill. Thus, the IW chemical properties in this interval are likely to be influenced by th e sill, as previously evidenced at DSDP Site 481 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1982).  

# 4.5.3.7. Organic geochemistry  

At Site U1550, organic geochemists performed sampling and analysis of gas and solid-phase samples and examined them for features that might distinguish this axial setting. In Hole U1550A, on e headspace gas sample was analyzed per $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ advance for routine hydrocarbon safety monitoring; void gases were quantified and sampled for hydrocarbon, $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ and CO contents; and the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents of particulate sediment were characterized. In Hole U1550B, hydrocarbon, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ , and CO analyses were performed on headspace and void gas samples. Carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents of sediment were characterized, and a comprehensive suite of gas an d sediment samples for postexpedition analyses were taken. Methane and $C_{2}-C_{6}$ hydrocarbons ar e detectable at depths below ${\sim}7$ mbsf. Low $C_{1}/C_{2}$ values that displayed an anomalous relationshi p with temperature were observed in both Holes U1550A and U1550B. The lowest ratios occurre d between $\mathord{\sim}100$ and $\mathord{\sim}130$ mbsf, but the concentrations of higher hydrocarbon were low and $C_{1}/C_{2}$ values returned to normal farther downhole. From elemental analysis, we infer that the primar y source of organic matter is marine in origin, although some samples indicate terrestrial organi c matter input, and others are ambiguous because of the influence of mineral-associated nitrogen. In Hole U1550B, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO are present at nanomolar concentrations.  

# 4.5.3.8. Microbiology  

Hole U1550B is located ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m}$ southeast of DSDP Site 481 where past studies included enrichments for hydrogenotrophic methanogens and detected living methanogens in shallow core s (Oremland et al., 1982). Consistent with previously measured moderate temperatures at Site 48 1 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1982), this hole presents an opportunity for microbiologists to examine the microbial abundance and community structure in sediments with a lower temperature gradient compared to the other sites of Expedition 385. Syringe samples for cell counts, 3-D structura l imaging, and RNA analyses were taken on the core receiving platform, preserved or frozen, an d stored for further analyses. Whole-round core samples were either stored in a $-80^{\circ}C$ freezer o r temporarily stored in a cold room of $4^{\circ}{-}8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and processed further for shore-based analyses, a s described for Site U1545. Samples for PFT measurements were taken on the core receiving platform by syringe at nine distinct horizons. Cell abundance for selected samples was determined b y direct counting with an epifluorescence microscope. Cell abundance was $3.1\,\times\,10^{6}$ cells/ $\mathsf{\Gamma}_{\mathbf{Cm}^{3}}$ i n bottom seawater, whereas seafloor sediments showed $1.1\times10^{9}$ cells $/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Below the seafloor, cel l abundance gradually decreased to $1.3\times10^{6}$ cells $^\prime\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at 94.5 mbsf and decreased below the detection limit of the protocol used for shipboard measurements at approximately 122 mbsf, which wa s nearly twice as deep as at Ringvent (Holes U1547B, U1548B, and U1548C).  

# 4.5.3.9. Petrophysics  

Measurements of physical properties made on whole-round and working-half core sections wer e compared between Holes U1550A and U1550B for lithostratigraphic characterization and correlation of visual core description with physical properties. Four in situ formation temperature measurements were conducted using the APCT-3 and SET2 tools to calculate the geothermal gradien t $(135^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km})$ and heat flow $(110\,\mathrm{mW/m^{2}})$ ). Conductivity measurements between Holes U1550A an d U1550B show a similar increasing trend with depth. Three main depth intervals are characterize d by notable petrophysical strength variations between the seafloor and 43 mbsf, from 43 to 86. 5 mbsf, and below 96.5 mbsf, showing significant increases in shear strength. These features ar e embedded in a rheology trend of generally increasing shear strength downhole whereas porosit y strongly decreases because of the presence of a sill at the bottom of both holes. Strength an d porosity measurements correlate positively with three lithologic subunits (IA–IC) and negativel y with the rest of the physical properties (e.g., bulk density). Physical properties in Holes U1550 A and U1550B show good correlation with depth except at ${\sim}80{-}90$ mbsf where the peaks of NGR, MS, and $P$ -wave velocity show an offset of $^{10\textrm{m}}$ between the two holes (at ${\sim}80$ mbsf in Hol e U1550A and ${\sim}90$ mbsf in Hole U1550B). Also, these physical properties reveal the presence of  a sill in both holes (top contact at ${\sim}204$ mbsf in Hole U1550A and ${\sim}170$ mbsf in Hole U1550B).  

# 4.6. Site U1551  

# 4.6.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1551 (proposed Site GUAYM-15A) is located ${\sim}29~\mathrm{km}$ southeast of the axial graben of th e northern Guaymas Basin spreading segment (Figures F1, F15). The type of sediment, the depositional environment, and the type, size, and, presumably, age of sill intrusions were all propose d to differ in the southeastern side of the spreading segment relative to the northwestern side (Tesk e et al., 2018). The sediment at Site U1551 was predicted to be predominantly terrigenous an d deposited as gravity-driven flows ranging from landslides to turbidites, with the underlying sill s appearing to be larger and more saucer-shaped than those in the northwest. It was hypothesize d that the physical and chemical properties of sediments may impact alteration in response to sil l intrusion, and this may have consequences for carbon cycling. Moreover, the physical propertie s of the sediments may influence the size and shape of the sills beneath Site U1551. In turn, permeability might evolve toward enhanced induration, ultimately affecting the efficiency of alteration. Terrestrial organic carbon and metals are predicted to be more abundant in these sediments relative to the northwestern part of the basin, and this may also affect sediment alteration and it s products. The primary scientific objective at Site U1551 was to constrain the influence of sediment type, an important factor controlling alteration and carbon cycling, on sill morphology b y studying the response of predominantly terrigenous sediments to sill intrusion.  

# 4.6.2. Operations  

Two holes were cored at Site U1551. Hole U1551A is located at $27^{\circ}12.3887\,\mathrm{N}$ , 111°13.1943ʹW in  a water depth of $1844.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . In Hole U1551A, we used the APC and HLAPC systems to advance fro m the seafloor to a final depth of 120.3 mbsf with a recovery of $122.1\;\mathrm{m}\;(102\%)$ . We made formatio n temperature measurements at several depths using the APCT-3 tool. Coring was terminate d because unconsolidated sand layers prevented us from reaching the deeper drilling objectives. I n Hole U1551B, located at $27^{\circ}12.3832\,\mathrm{N}$ , 111°13.1841ʹW in a water depth of $1843.9\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , we deploye d the APC system. Cores penetrated from the seafloor to a final depth of 48.5 mbsf and recovere d $50.0\textrm{m}(103\%)$ . Hole U1551B was dedicated to extensive microbial and biogeochemical samplin g that required the deployment of PFTs downhole on all cores to monitor drilling fluid (seawater )  

contamination. The pace of coring in Hole U1551B was at times adjusted to accommodate th e complex microbial sampling program conducted on the core receiving platform. A total of $34.3\,\mathrm{{h}}$ , or 1.4 days, were spent at Site U1551. Its cores, penetration depths, core recovery, and operation s schedule are displayed in Table T1.  

# 4.6.3. Principal results  

# 4.6.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The sediments recovered at Site U1551 are assigned to Lithostratigraphic Unit I. They represent  a combination of biogenic (diatom ooze to diatom clay) and terrigenous (sand/silt/clay grade) components with the highest overall proportion of silty to sandy intervals $(\sim\!60\%)$ cored during Expedition 385 (Figure F16). Macroscopic core description and microscopic smear slide analysis sho w that two main types of lithologic components are clustered in four different stratigraphic intervals. These lithologic patterns are reflected in the NGR, MS, and color reflectance data, forming th e basis of the division of Unit I into four subunits, with Subunits IA and IC dominated by biogeni c sedimentation and Subunits IB and ID appearing more siliciclastic in character. Lithologies i n which the content of diatoms is very high $(>\!85\%)$ are mainly found in Subunit IA. The underlyin g Subunit IB includes authigenic carbonates that occur in small patches of micrite, partly cemente d sandstone intervals, or carbonate concretions. This subunit also contains thick sand beds, an d overall, it is dominated by coarser grained siliciclastic sediments that correspond to higher M S and NGR values. Subunit IC is composed of silt-rich diatom clay and clay-rich, mainly homogeneous, diatom ooze alternating with beds of gray sand and silty sand. Subunit ID is mainly composed of medium-grained sand, which is partially interpreted to represent coring-induced flow-i n rather than in situ deposition. Although Site U1551 and Site U1549 share many lithostratigraphi c similarities, the former contains larger proportions of siliciclastic material. The predominance o f siliciclastic components over biogenic ones and the presence of coarse-grained mass-gravity flo w deposits suggest that the deposition at this site was more influenced by terrigenous sources than a t the other sites drilled in Guaymas Basin during Expedition 385. This may be related to the mor e proximal location of Site U1551 to the Yaqui River delta.

The locations of drilled holes are no t distinguishable at the given scale. Contour lines $=10\,\mathsf{m}$ .  

# 4.6.3.2. Structural geology  

At Site U1551, Holes U1551A and U1551B penetrated Lithostratigraphic Unit I, recovering a sedimentary sequence of diatom ooze, diatom clay, sand, and silt. Bedding and lamination in the sedimentary succession are similar to those described for Sites U1545–U1550. However, Site U155 1 has intervals of massive sand layers in which the lack of stratification prevented any deformatio n structures from being identified. Folds are seen in Subunit IB in both holes, where contortion an d soft-sediment deformation produced steep to overturned bedding below ${\sim}15$ mbsf. The folde d strata are cut by a single set of faults with subparallel orientations and apparent dips of $45^{\circ}{-70^{\circ}}$ . Faults were found in some deeper intervals. The differences in depths characterizing the folde d strata in Holes U1551A and U1551B may have been partly caused by faulting prior to the deposition of Subunit IA. No faulting is inferred in Subunit IA at Site U1551, based on the stratigraphi c similarity between the two drill holes.  

# 4.6.3.3. Biostratigraphy  

In Hole U1551A, calcareous nannofossils are abundant to rare to 96.8 mbsf with two barren intervals around 24.8 and 25.1 mbsf. Farther downhole, nannofossils are barren in the interval $102.14-$ 116.19 mbsf and abundant in the bottom sample from 119.01 mbsf. Nannofossil preservation i s good and moderate throughout the entire sedimentary sequence except for two samples with poo r preservation at 22.0 and 25.8 mbsf. The barren intervals correspond to recovered sections of predominantly sandy lithology. Marine diatoms are abundant with good preservation only in th e uppermost part of Site U1551. Then, they decrease in abundance with moderate to poor preservation from the seafloor to 36.9 mbsf, followed by an interval without diatoms from 36.9 to 61.2 2 mbsf. Diatoms vary from common to rare with moderate to poor preservation from 71 to 108.2 8 mbsf, and they are barren at the bottom of Hole U1551A. Diatoms are abundant but poorly preserved in a spot sample from 119.0 mbsf at the bottom of Hole U1551A. The occurrence of $E$ . huxleyi from the seafloor to the bottom of Hole U1551A dates the entire sediment sequence t o (Holocene–)late–middle Pleistocene, or younger than $0.29\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Hole $\mathrm{U}1551\mathrm{A}=0{-}119.01$ mbsf). This age assignment is consistent with the absence of $P_{\star}$ lacunosa $\mathrm{(LAD=0.44\;Ma)}$ ) and ${\cal F}$ reinholdii $\left(\mathrm{LAD}\ =\ 0.62\,\ \mathrm{Ma}\right)$ in all examined samples. The estimated average sedimentation rate i s ${>}410.4\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{My}$ $(>41.04\,\mathrm{cm/ky})$ .

# 4.6.3.4. Paleomagnetism  

AF demagnetization up to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ was carried out with the SRM on all sediment archive-half cor e sections from Hole U1551A (Cores 1H–19F). The drilling-induced overprint was successfull y removed from APC and HLAPC cores (from the seafloor to ${\sim}120~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ) upon demagnetization. Inclination values after demagnetization at $20~\mathrm{mT}$ cluster around $47^{\circ}$ , which is comparable to th e expected GAD inclination at the latitude of the site (45.8°). A detailed analysis of the remanence o f discrete samples from Hole U1551A shows that the drilling-induced overprint is removed by 1 0 mT, and the ChRM is in accordance with the SRM measurements. Thus, Hole U1551A cores wer e assigned to the normal Brunhes Chron C1n (younger than $0.78\ \mathrm{Ma}_{\prime}$ ). Sedimentary discrete samples taken in Hole U1551A predominantly show prolate behavior throughout the hole, with th e $K_{\mathrm{max}}$ principal axis of AMS distributed in the horizontal plane. No paleomagnetic measurement s were implemented in Hole U1551B.  

# 4.6.3.5. Inorganic geochemistry  

In Holes U1551A and U1551B, a total of 18 IW samples were taken from all sediment lithologie s except for unconsolidated sands. It has been challenging to decipher the IW properties because o f the limited number of collected IW samples as a consequence of the abundance of sand. However, as demonstrated by the nearly complete sulfate depletion that coincides with a concentration pea k for dissolved sulfide, the SMTZ is located at ${\sim}25$ mbsf. Concentration maxima for alkalinit y (around $32\;\mathrm{mM})$ ) at the SMTZ and for ammonium $\left(6\;\mathrm{mM}\right)$ below the SMTZ around 35–40 mbs f are the lowest found during this expedition with the exception of those within Ringvent. These lo w concentrations suggest decreased microbal organic matter remineralization in terrestriall y impacted sediments. Authigenic carbonate precipitation was observed visually, and the precipitation depth coincides with a sharp decrease in $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ concentrations.  

# 4.6.3.6. Organic geochemistry  

At Site U1551, organic geochemists sampled and analyzed gas and solid-phase samples to examin e whether the terrigenous influence at this site generates specific organic geochemical signatures. I n Hole U1551A, one headspace gas sample was analyzed per $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ advance for routine hydrocarbo n safety monitoring, and the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents of particulate sediment wer e characterized. In Hole U1551B, hydrocarbon analyses on headspace gas were performed at hig h resolution (two per $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of core), $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO contents were measured, and carbon, nitrogen, an d sulfur contents of sediment were characterized. Hydrocarbon gases are detectable below ${\sim}30$ mbs f and are primarily composed of methane and ethane. $C_{3}-C_{6}$ hydrocarbons were detected in only  a few intervals at very low concentrations. Gas concentration with depth is strongly influenced b y the presence of sand. From elemental analysis, we infer that the primary source of organic matte r in organic-rich intervals is marine in origin. The presence of mineral nitrogen in the organic-poo r levels prevents interpreting the $C/\Nu$ values in terms of organic source. $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO are present a t nanomolar concentration levels and exhibit no trend with depth.  

# 4.6.3.7. Microbiology  

Site U1551 is located on the southeastern flanking region of Guaymas Basin in an area of low hea t flow and is influenced by terrigenous sedimentation derived from the Yaqui River, which drain s the Sierra Madre Occidental and coastal Sonora. Consequently, this site presents an opportunit y for microbiologists to examine microbial abundance and community structure in terrestria l organic carbon–enriched sediments with more moderate temperature gradients compared to th e other sites drilled during Expedition 385. Syringe samples for cell counts, 3-D structural imaging, and RNA analyses were taken on the core receiving platform, preserved or frozen, and stored fo r further analyses. Whole-round core samples were either stored in a $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer or temporaril y stored in a $4^{\circ}{-}8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ cold room and processed further for shore-based analyses, as described for Sit e U1545. Samples for PFT measurements were taken on the core receiving platform by syringe a t five distinct horizons. Cell abundance for selected samples was determined by direct countin g with an epifluorescence microscope. Cell abundance was $1.1\times10^{6}$ cells $\scriptstyle\mathbf{Cm}^{3}$ in bottom seawate r and $0.9~\times~10^{9}$ cells $^{\prime}\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in seafloor sediments. Below the seafloor, cell abundance graduall y decreased to $6.9\times10^{6}$ cells $\mathbf{\omega}^{\prime}\mathbf{cm}^{3}$ at approximately 39 mbsf but remained above the detection limi t of the protocol that we used for shipboard measurements at this deepest sampling depth in Hol e U1551B.  

# 4.6.3.8. Petrophysics  

Physical properties at Site U1551 were measured on whole-round and working-half sections. Tw o holes were cored: Hole U1551A to ${\sim}120$ mbsf and Hole U1551B to ${\sim}49$ mbsf. The acquired dat a were compared between holes for lithostratigraphic characterization and correlation of cor e description information with the physical properties data. Four in situ formation temperatur e measurements were made with the APCT-3 tool to calculate geothermal gradient $({\sim}100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km})$ and heat flow $({\sim}108\,\mathrm{\mW/m^{2}})$ . All petrophysical parameters consistently identify four distinc t depth intervals that correspond to alternation of diatom ooze and silty sand-dominated lithology: from the seafloor to 15 mbsf, between ${\sim}15$ and ${\sim}65\$ mbsf, from ${\sim}67\$ to 92 mbsf, and below 92 mbsf. Shear strength consistently increases with depth, coinciding with higher values in compressiv e strength. Porosity and density values derived from MAD measurements show a strong negativ e correlation at all depths. The other measured physical properties (density, NGR, MS, and $P$ -wav e velocity) show a positive correlation with depth that is in accordance with the corresponding presence of diatom ooze, clay, and sand beds.  

# 4.7. Site U1552  

# 4.7.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1552 (proposed Site GUAYM-10B) is located ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{km}$ northwest of the northern axial grabe n in Guaymas Basin (Figure F17), proximal to the Sonora margin (Figure F1). The site is adjacent t o a mostly buried mound that sits atop a pipe-like, acoustically blanked zone that was observed i n Seismic Line SO-112 (Figure F17), extending toward the edge of an interpreted sill intrusion a t ${\sim}700$ mbsf. Cold-seep seafloor communities are known to exist in the area above the edges of th e interpreted deep sill. The mound structure is similar to the surficial mound near Site U1549, where gas hydrate is present at the seafloor, and it was thus expected that massive gas hydrat e would be sampled in Hole U1552A, which is situated directly adjacent to the mostly burie d mound. Like Site U1549, the association of a relatively deep sill, gas hydrates, and nearby seafloo r communities connects multiple components of the carbon budget in a sediment deposition system influenced by a deep sill. Therefore, the primary objectives for Site U1552 were to characterize the physical, chemical, and microbial properties of this environment and to assess (1) th e influence of the deep sill on IW chemistry and gas hydrate stability, (2) the role of gas hydrate as  a carbon-storage buffer, (3) the utilization of permeable pathways between the sill and the seafloo r for the transport of deep thermogenic gas, and (4) the impact of lateral gradients away from th e pipe structure on microbial life.

Hole s U1552A and U1552B were drilled just $5~\mathsf{m}$ apart from each other, so their locations are not distinguishable at the give n scale.

Contour lines $=1~\mathsf{m}$ .  

# 4.7.2. Operations  

We cored three holes at Site U1552. Hole U1552A is located at $27^{\circ}33.2906\mathrm{\,N}$ , $111^{\circ}32.9665^{\prime}\mathbb{W}$ in  a water depth of $1841.6\;\mathrm{m}$ . In Hole U1552A, we used the APC system to advance from the seafloo r to a final depth of 107.5 mbsf with a recovery of $73.9\;\mathrm{m}$ $(69\%)$ . We made formation temperatur e measurements at several depths with the APCT-3 tool. In Hole U1552B, located at $27^{\circ}33.2885\,\mathrm{N},$ $111^{\circ}32.9640^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in a water depth of $1841.1\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{~\!~}}$ , APC coring penetrated from the seafloor to a fina l depth of 55.0 mbsf and recovered $40.0\,\mathrm{m}\left(73\%\right)$ . Hole U1552B was dedicated to extensive microbia l and biogeochemical sampling that required the deployment of PFTs downhole on all cores t o monitor drilling fluid (seawater) contamination. Few cores from Holes U1552A and U1552 B recovered gas hydrates. In Hole U1552C, located at $27^{\circ}33.2181\mathrm{\,N}$ , $111^{\circ}32.8557^{\prime}\mathbb{W}$ in a water dept h of $1844.3\;\mathrm{m}$ , we deployed the APC system. Cores penetrated from the seafloor to a final depth o f 99.3 mbsf and recovered $78.3~\mathrm{m}$ $(79\%)$ . A total of $32.6~\mathrm{h}$ , or 1.4 days, were spent at Site U1552. Cores, penetration depths, core recovery, and operations schedule for all holes of Site U1552 ar e provided in Table T1.  

# 4.7.3. Principal results  

# 4.7.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The deepest hole (Hole U1552A) recovered a $105.2~\mathrm{m}$ thick succession of sediments constitutin g Lithostratigraphic Unit I (Figure F18). The lithologies at this site are mainly diatom clay, silty clay, and sandy silt, alternating at vertical scales of meters. This alternation occurs throughout th e recovered section without any specific trend or clustering of one lithology with respect to the others. Hence, only one lithostratigraphic unit was identified. Holes U1552A and U1552C have a hig h level of correlation observed at the scale of a single bed. The most traceable of these beds are dominated by coarse-grained siliciclastic deposits (sand and silt). The thickest beds $(\sim\!5\,\textrm{m})$ exhibi t scoured bases and normally graded sand that fines upward into clayey silt to silty clay. The mai n biogenic components in the sediment are siliceous diatoms with rare radiolarians and silicoflagellates. The silt to sand fraction mainly consists of feldspar and lithic fragments with lesse r quartz, micaceous, and dense minerals. Foraminifers also are a significant component in severa l beds. Overall, calcareous nannofossils and foraminifers are present throughout the recovered sediments, along with organic matter and plant debris. Authigenic carbonates occur only in the uppe r part of the site as disseminated micrite (micrometer-sized authigenic carbonate particles) or a s cements in small, sandy concretions. Fossil bivalves, belonging to the Lucinidae family, wer e observed at the uppermost part of all three holes. Holes U1552A–U1552C recovered gas hydrate s from ${\sim}22{-}32$ mbsf that decomposed quickly after the cores arrived on deck. As a consequence o f hydrate dissociation and gas expansion, the sediments were often disturbed. Thus, most cores displayed gas expansion cracks and voids. Complex structures were observed in Hole U1552C, including laminated diatom clay intervals that are crosscut by gray clayey silt at high angle contacts, and which locally extend down the core for as much as $^{1\,}\mathbf{m}$ .

# 4.7.3.2. Structural geology  

Coring at Site U1552 was intended to constrain differences in seismic reflection stratigraphy tha t were seen on either side of a seafloor mound. In the three holes cored, the sequence has beds tha t are generally horizontal, with no significant tilt domains or folded strata. However, gas hydrate s that disturbed the sediments were found between ${\sim}22$ and ${\sim}32$ mbsf in all three holes at Sit e U1552. Overall, Hole U1552C revealed much more deformation than the other two holes, showin g evidence for considerable injection and mobilization of sand along a high-angle conduit or clasti c dike that continues through two sections of core. In some places, the clastic dike occupies a preexisting fault plane. The remobilization of sand indicates that a substantial volume of sedimen t may have been lost from below. Other oblique faults and fractures were found in Hole U1552C a t depths below the clastic dike, and we attribute these to mechanical instability caused by the presence of gas hydrates.  

# 4.7.3.3. Biostratigraphy  

At Site U1552, calcareous nannofossils are well preserved with abundant to common occurrenc e throughout the entire sedimentary sequence, and marine diatoms are dominant/abundant to common with good/moderate preservation. No biostratigraphic datum was defined in the successio n from the (Holocene? to) late to middle Pleistocene. The occurrence of calcareous nannofossil $E$ . huxleyi at the bottom of both holes dates the entire sediment sequence to (Holocene–)late– middle Pleistocene, or younger than $0.29\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . This age assignment is consistent with the absenc e of $P_{\cdot}$ lacunosa $\mathrm{(LAD=0.44\Ma)}$ and $F$ reinholdii $\mathrm{(LAD=0.62\Ma)}$ ) in all examined samples. Th e estimated average sedimentation rate is >362.6 m/My $(>36.26\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ ).  

# 4.7.3.4. Paleomagnetism  

AF demagnetization up to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ was conducted with the SRM on all sediment archive-half cor e sections from Hole U1552A (Cores 1H–12H) and Hole U1552C (Cores 1H–11H). A small drillinginduced overprint was successfully removed following demagnetization. Inclination values afte r demagnetization at $20\,\mathrm{mT}$ cluster around $40^{\circ}$ and $43^{\circ}$ for Holes U1552A and U1552C, respectively, which is slightly lower than the expected GAD inclination at the latitude of the site $(\sim\!46.2^{\circ})$ . Onl y the NRM of archive-half sections in Hole U1552B (Cores 1H–6H) was measured. A detaile d analysis of the remanence of discrete samples from Holes U1552A and U1552C shows that th e drilling-induced overprint was removed by $5~\mathrm{mT}$ and the ChRM is in accordance with the SR M measurements. Thus, all Site U1552 cores were assigned to the normal Brunhes Chron C1 n (younger than $0.78\;\mathrm{Ma}_{}^{}$ ). The AMS of discrete sediment samples is characterized by a mixture o f prolate and oblate behavior throughout Hole U1552A.  

# 4.7.3.5. Inorganic geochemistry  

A total of 31 IW samples were collected from the sedimentary succession at Site U1552. Based o n the sulfate profile and a slight increase of methane, the SMTZ is estimated at 10 mbsf, one of th e shallowest SMTZs encountered during this expedition. Concentrations of ammonium exceed 3 5 $\mathrm{mM}$ at 60 mbsf, and alkalinity remains around $150\;\mathrm{mM}$ below 30 mbsf and peaks at $175\;\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; thes e values are the highest recorded at any of the Expedition 385 sites. Salinity and $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ concentration s were measured on gas hydrate–bound water from Hole U1552C. Salinity values of $2~\mathrm{mM}$ and $C1^{-}$ values of $10.5~\mathrm{mM}$ are both depleted compared to seawater (salinity $=35~\mathrm{mM}$ ; $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}\,=\,559~\mathrm{mM},$ ). Thus, the dissociation of gas hydrate could cause anomalies in the retrieved IW as observed in th e ${\sim}500\ m\ M\,\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ concentration at 25 mbsf from Hole U1552C. Below the SMTZ, many cation concentrations $(\mathrm{K}^{+},\mathrm{M}\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ , $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ , etc.) increase, except the $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ concentration.  

# 4.7.3.6. Organic geochemistry  

At Site U1552, organic geochemists sampled and analyzed gas samples. In Hole U1552A, one t o two headspace gas samples were analyzed per $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ advance for routine hydrocarbon safety monitoring, and void gases were quantified and sampled for hydrocarbon content. In Hole U1552B, hydrocarbon analyses on headspace gas were performed, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO contents in headspace vial s were measured, and void gases were quantified and sampled for hydrocarbons, $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ , and CO contents. In Hole U1552C, hydrocarbon analyses on headspace gas were performed and void gase s were quantified and sampled for hydrocarbon, $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ and CO contents as well as for shore-base d analyses. Because time was running out at the conclusion of Expedition 385, no Site U1552 sediment samples were analyzed for carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur contents. This data set will be acquire d via shore-based analysis and published as a separate data report. Site U1552 featured the presenc e of gas hydrates in the sediment column between 9 and 27 mbsf. Maximum methane concentrations in headspace gas were detected in this depth interval. $C_{2}-C_{6}$ hydrocarbons were detectabl e at depths below ${\sim}25$ mbsf without a clear trend downhole. The abundance of dissolved gas in th e sediment was marked by an abundance of voids in the cores, which could represent more tha n $100\%$ of the sediment recovery. Methane was dominant in these voids. $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO were detecte d in the void gases, but showed no clear trend downhole.  

# 4.7.3.7. Microbiology  

Site U1552 provided access to hydrate-rich sediments overlying cooler, deep sills on the norther n flank of Guaymas Basin near the transition to the Sonora margin. This site presented an opportunity for microbiologists to examine microbial abundance and community structure change s throughout the gas hydrate stability zone in the sediment. Syringe samples for cell counts, 3- D structural imaging, and RNA analyses were taken on the core receiving platform, preserved o r frozen, and stored for further analyses. Whole-round core samples were either stored in a $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer or temporarily stored in a $4^{\circ}{-}8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ cold room and processed further for shore-based analyses, as described for Site U1545. Cell abundance for selected samples was determined by direc t counting with an epifluorescence microscope. Cell abundance was $6.6\times10^{6}$ cells $^\prime\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in botto m seawater and $1.2\times10^{9}$ cells $I_{\mathrm{Cm}^{3}}$ in seafloor sediments. Below the seafloor, cell abundance gradually decreased to $8.1\,\times\,10^{6}\;\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at approximately 47 mbsf but remained above the detectio n limit of the protocol that we used for shipboard measurements at this deepest sample obtaine d from Hole U1552B.  

# 4.7.3.8. Petrophysics  

Physical properties were measured on whole-round and split core sections. The acquired dat a were compared between Holes U1552A and U1552C for lithostratigraphic characterization an d correlation of core description information with physical properties data. Seven in situ formatio n temperature measurements were taken with the APCT-3 tool to calculate the geothermal gradien t $(262^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km})$ and heat flow $(222\mathrm{{\mW/m^{2}}})$ . Two different intervals were identified in all petrophysical parameters. From the seafloor to ${\sim}12$ mbsf and at 18–87 mbsf, density, NGR, and MS ar e mainly constant. Peaks observed at ${\sim}18$ , ${\sim}58$ , and ${\sim}93$ mbsf show increases in density, NGR, an d MS values and decreases in porosity and strength values. Porosity measured on discrete MA D samples generally outlines a trend that mirrors the bulk density measurements. The shear strengt h regularly increases with depth. For $P$ -wave velocity, values from 12 mbsf to the bottom of bot h Holes U1552A and U1552C predominantly show an erratic pattern typically related to voids an d cracks in the cores.  

# 5. Preliminary scientific assessment  

# 5.1. Fundamental design of Expedition 385  

Expedition 385 drilled sequences of marine sediments and mafic sills in Guaymas Basin to explor e how carbon cycling within a young sedimentary rift basin is influenced by the interacting physical, chemical, and biological processes that accompany sill intrusion into organic-rich sediments.  

Magmatic emplacement in Guaymas Basin is not limited to the spreading center, as at mos t mature mid-ocean-ridge (MOR) systems, but it extends tens of kilometers away from the divergent plate boundary, providing a diversity of sedimentary settings influenced by sill intrusion. Ou r drill sites followed a northwest–southeast transect across Guaymas Basin designed to captur e some of this diversity, including contrasting sediment depositional regimes, sediment type, sil l intrusion depth, and sill intrusion age. Sites U1545 and U1546, ${\sim}1\,\mathrm{km}$ from each other, share th e same sequence of sediment and sedimentation history, but a ${\sim}70\;\mathrm{m}$ thick igneous sill has intrude d the sediments beneath Site U1546, whereas Site U1545 is undisturbed, thus enabling, throug h comparison of cores from the two sites, direct inferences on the influence of sill intrusion on sedimentary carbon, poor water chemistry, microbial habitat, and other topics of interest to this expedition. Sites U1547 and U1548 targeted a shallow, “warm,” active, and off-axis sill system withi n predominantly pelagic sediments. Sites U1549 and U1552 were aimed at cold-seep systems apparently driven by conduits inherited from older sills, now deeply buried by hemipelagic sediments. Site U1550 targeted sills emplaced within the northern axial graben that are subjected to a complex interaction of tectonics and hemipelagic sedimentation. The southernmost Site U1551 provided an opportunity to drill a very large, deeply buried bowl-shaped sill intruded into primaril y terrigenous mass-gravity flow sediment deposits.  

The drilling program at each site was designed to accommodate multidisciplinary drilling objectives by generally combining Hole A, which was dedicated to comprehensive core description, sedimentology, thermal measurements, and initial geochemistry, with Hole B, which was subjected to extensive microbiological and (bio)geochemical sampling. Whenever possible, APC o r HLAPC coring was used, and we transitioned to XCB coring only when necessary to penetrat e harder sediment formations and the sediment/sill contact zones. The RCB system was used for th e sill intrusions to remarkable effect, providing a comparatively high core recovery through thes e igneous sections.  

# 5.2. Site overview  

# 5.2.1. Sites U1545 and U1546  

The first sites drilled were Sites U1545 and U1546, ${\sim}52~\mathrm{km}$ northwest of the axial graben of th e northern trough. These two sites were high priority because their comparison provides an idea l opportunity to quantitatively assess the influence of sill intrusion on sediments. The two sites ar e separated by only ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{km}$ and thus contain nearly identical sedimentary strata, but they differ i n that the upper ${\sim}480\;\mathrm{m}$ of these sediments at Site U1545 are undisturbed by sill intrusion, wherea s at Site U1546, the same sedimentary sequence has been intruded by a large sill $(\sim\!355\!-\!430~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ). The presumed paleosurface marking the intrusion event provides a reliable age of maximum $\mathord{\sim}100$ ka, making the sill young enough to not have been affected by postemplacement tectonic processes but old enough to have completely cooled to the point where hydrothermalism is no longe r present. These sites are also ideal for developing an age model and sedimentological framewor k for Guaymas Basin, owing to the near-continuous record of pelagic sediment accumulation to th e total drilled depths $(>\!500\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) and to the lack of significant unconformities associated with tectonic or mass-wasting processes. Therefore, we drilled multiple holes at both sites and cored th e complete sediment and sill sequence with high recovery using mainly APC or HLAPC corin g within sediments and RCB coring within sills. We obtained high-quality cores well suited fo r (bio)geochemistry and microbiology sampling, including our best sediment record below a majo r sill recovered from Site U1546. We also made multiple temperature measurements at each site, enabling a very precise calculation of the thermal gradients. We reached the upper temperatur e limit of the available measurement tools $(\sim\!80^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ at each site, demonstrating that geothermal gradients are high to a great distance from the plate boundary.  

# 5.2.2. Sites U1547 and U1548  

Sites U1547 and U1548 are situated inside and peripheral to the circular hydrothermal moun d structure of Ringvent, respectively. The original intent was to recover sediments overlying  a hydrothermally active, shallow sill and thereby explore the dynamics of hydrothermal circulatio n and the associated imprint on sediment diagenesis and microbiology. This plan was implemente d but soon took a backseat to drilling into the underlying sill. The Ringvent sill at Site U1547 developed into a defining target of this expedition. Its unexpected dimensions and texturally highl y variable basaltic lithology—with abundant vesicles, several generations of mineralized veins an d brecciation associated with numerous sediment contacts—contrasts with the simpler and rathe r uniform structure of the singular massive basaltic-doleritic-gabbroic sill of Site U1546. The microbiology and organic geochemistry laboratories adapted their sediment-focused research program s and sampled the Ringvent sill for gas and solid-phase analyses, microbial cultivations, and gen e and biomarker studies, whereas the petrophysics group examined the Ringvent sills’ unusual morphologies and thermal properties. As a result, Ringvent Sites U1547 and U1548 catalyzed an integrated sediment-sill research program that pulled together science party members from al l disciplines.  

# 5.2.3. Sites U1549 and U1552  

Site U1549 originally targeted a well-studied, active methane seep site associated with an underlying sill (Teske et al., 2021). To avoid drilling into shallow gas accumulations that surrounded th e seep area, the site was moved and then served as a deep-basin off-axis reference site proximal t o the Sonora margin that is unaffected by advective flux driven by a deeper sill. Site U1549 provide s an instructive comparison to alternate Site U1552. Site U1552 is located proximal to the base o f the Sonora margin and targeted the vicinity of a hydrate-rich methane seep situated directly abov e a seismically imaged conduit extending upward from a deep sill with an intrusion age likely muc h older than the sill at Site U1546. Both Sites U1549 and U1552 recovered a similar sedimentar y sequence consisting of both marine sediments and sandy mass-gravity flow layers. Comparison o f these sites provides several notable features. Massive gas hydrate was recovered in Site U155 2 cores but not in Site U1549 cores, although disseminated hydrate may be present at Site U1549; hydrate recovery at Site U1552 may reflect greater proximity of the hole to the central methan e conduit of this cold seep location. Interestingly, the thermal gradient at Site U1552 is substantiall y steeper than at Site U1549. The IW chemistry differs between the two sites, including notabl y higher Mg content in the IW of Site U1552 cores, which showed concentrations substantiall y greater than seawater. These observations suggest deeply buried sills can promote advective flu x of heat and chemical compounds that are relevant to carbon cycling long after sill emplacement.  

# 5.2.4. Site U1550  

Site U1550, located in the northern axial trough of Guaymas Basin, was intended to be the “hydrothermal” representative along the transect, based on the unspoken assumption that an axial sit e should experience higher heat flow and higher in situ temperatures than off-axis sites. Site U155 0 was drilled in the immediate vicinity of Site 481 from DSDP Leg 64, and it recovered short sil l sections with veined structures and fractured morphology that resemble sill cores obtained at thi s location during Leg 64. Site 481 was also the only site where thermal measurements were availabl e (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1982). However, because all Expedition 385 sites had larger therma l gradients than expected, this site turned out to be the coldest, demonstrating that an axial locatio n is by no means an accurate predictor of hydrothermal heat flow. The recovered sedimentary column was dominated by event beds that demonstrate the influence of sediment slumping an d mass-gravity flows on sedimentation within the axial trough.  

# 5.2.5. Site U1551  

Site U1551, located ${\sim}29~\mathrm{km}$ southeast of the axial trough, targeted large, deeply buried, bowlshaped sills intruded into dominantly terrigenous sediments deposited as mass-gravity flows. Thi s end-member–sill-sediment system is important because it is representative of the sill system s emplaced during large igneous events and implicated in global scale catastrophes. It is als o important because metals, which are more dominant in terrigenous sediments, are believed t o facilitate pyrolysis and thus impact all aspects of carbon cycling driven by sill intrusion. However, thick layers of loose sands of these mass-flow sediments destabilized the holes and the site had t o be abandoned prematurely after establishing two relatively shallow holes. Although the deep sill s could not be reached, Site U1551, the first scientific drilling site in southeastern Guaymas Basin, yielded new insights into sediment flow and event-bed formation and highlighted the strong contrasts in sedimentary environments between northwestern and southeastern Guaymas Basin.  

# 5.2.6. Summary  

To summarize, a major scientific focus of this expedition will be the comparison of massively sedimented Sites U1545 and U1546 on the northwestern end of Guaymas Basin, both successfull y drilled and recovered to depths exceeding $500\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{~}}$ , with Ringvent Sites U1547 and U1548, wher e drilling penetrated a massive sill of previously unseen proportions (potentially consisting of distinct intrusions sheets) and its shallow cover of biogenic and hemipelagic sediment with authigenic mineral precipitates. The two northwestern Sites U1545 and U1546 also provide an excellen t opportunity to evaluate the consequences of a major sill intrusion into the same sedimentar y sequence. The closely spaced holes of Ringvent Sites U1547 and U1548 amount to a finely resolve d transect from the interior to the periphery of Ringvent, the only time in IODP history that a majo r sill and its impact on sediment lithology and geochemistry have been examined in such detail. I n addition, results obtained from sites closer to the Sonora margin (Sites U1549 and U1552), in th e northern axial trough (Site U1550), and on the southeastern flanking region (Site U1551) wil l explore the influence of terrigenous sedimentation, gas hydrate occurrence, and cooler formatio n temperatures in different combinations on the deportment of sedimentary carbon in such divers e depositional settings.  

# 5.3. Comparison of DSDP Leg 64 and IODP Expedition 385  

The scientific objectives of Expedition 385 were similar to those of Leg 64, although in the fina l analysis, the overlap in scientific outcomes turned out to be less than expected. Both expedition s focused on the interaction of sills with sediments and the geochemical consequences of sil l emplacement, with actual overlap at axial Sites 481 and U1550. However, the contexts of the tw o expeditions were very different, and the overlap in site selection and scientific outcomes is actuall y limited. A key science objective of Leg 64 was understanding MOR magmatism in the presence o f sediments. Leg 64 produced remarkable scientific results describing the influence of sill intrusio n on sediments and organic compounds within the high-permeability axial trough environment. A t that time, and until very recently, it was believed that all MOR magmatism was focused at the plat e boundary, so there was no reason to imagine that a large variety of sill-sediment systems coul d actually be present in the off-axis environment of Guaymas Basin (Lizarralde et al., 2011), muc h less to explore how carbon cycling may vary among those settings. Whereas Leg 64 focused exclusively on (near-)axial trough sill-sediments systems, Expedition 385 expanded across the basin an d provided excellent records of the sedimented slopes and rift basin floor. It explored the contrast s between different settings, including buried cool sills in thermal equilibrium with surroundin g sediments (Site U1546), shallow hot sills that still function as a present-day heat source for hydrothermal fluid circulation and associated mineral precipitation and organic matter alteration (Site s U1547 and U1548), and relic systems that still promote advective flow and support cold-seep seafloor communities (Sites U1549 and U1552). Organic and inorganic geochemical profiles fo r Expedition 385 were generally more finely resolved, and once shore-based analyses are completed, they will include a wider spectrum of ions and hydrocarbons. Today, the greater sensitivity an d wider range of stable ion analysis, coupled with high-powered analytical chemistry, provides a versatile toolbox to constrain transformations and origins of specific molecules. Leg 64 pioneere d microbiological studies of the sedimentary subsurface with a cultivation survey of methanogen s using hydrogen and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ as substrates (Oremland et al., 1982). Cultivations, activity assays, metabolic rate measurements, DNA sequencing, genomics, and biomarker studies of the deep biosphere have taken over Expedition 385 to a large extent. Most of these techniques were no t available or were in their infancy 40 y ago. However, these technical refinements do not change th e fact that Leg 64 provided the fundamental outlines for understanding the Guaymas Basin subsurface, regardless of whether some of these outlines require adjustments in the near future.  

# 5.4. Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition results address research questions in several broad categories that are described in th e expedition’s Scientific Prospectus in the context of the major IODP scientific themes (Teske et al., 2018). At the risk of unduly simplifying this complex network of multidisciplinary research questions and hypotheses, we focus here on the central motivating question of this expedition: to wha t extent do sill emplacement and associated hydrothermal activity retain or mobilize subsurfac e sedimentary carbon, and is this process modulated by microbial activity? The framing of this basi c question was shaped on the one hand by current hypotheses that posit dramatic thermogenic carbon release from sediments in response to sill intrusion and, on the other hand, by the dominan t influence of microbially mediated transformations on the fate of carbon within the upper ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ of marine sediments. Expedition 385 results shed new light on aspects of both of these linked processes.  

A key question related to the purely thermal impacts of sill intrusion on sedimentary carbon follows: does sill emplacement within successions of organic-rich sediments transform and mobiliz e buried organic matter within a broad thermal alteration zone surrounding the sill, with substantially reduced sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) content near the sill and increased hydrocarbon concentrations above the sill? Based on shipboard data sets, the answer to this question i s “less than expected” for the two types of sill/sediment settings studied at Sites U1546 and U1547. At those sites, decreasing TOC and increasing hydrocarbon concentrations are limited to a relatively narrow contact aureole, but dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) precipitation begins as soli d carbonates at the sill contact zone and extends far into the overlying sediment where abundan t micrites are observed. Reduced sedimentary TOC concentrations were observed only in ver y close proximity to the sill/sediment contact. This contact is often marked by a solid layer of carbonates on top of the sills, suggesting either remineralization and precipitation of local sedimentary organic matter upon sill emplacement or authigenic precipitation of pore water alkalinity. Methane and volatile alkane concentrations increase substantially in close proximity to a sill an d remain high within the porous rock throughout the sill, suggesting the possibility that the fairl y narrow “hydrocarbon halo” that blurs into the surrounding sediment has a component that originates in the sill itself. The question whether the sill functions as a passive storage medium tha t returns previously adsorbed hydrocarbons, or acts as a hydrocarbon-generating net source, remains to be resolved.  

More than hydrocarbons, small-scale authigenic carbonate particles (micrite) are disseminate d over wide intervals in the sediment column. Sill intrusions could impact the formation of carbonates in several ways. They may make methane more available for microbially mediated increase d alkalinity; they may provide cations needed to form carbonate, in particular $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ , which ma y explain the observed abundance of dolomite; and they create steeper thermal gradients that ma y accelerate the diagenetic and possibly microbially catalyzed reactions that contribute to micrit e formation, pushing the micrite-forming zone upward in the sediment column.  

Expedition 385 results of cored sills themselves suggest an entirely new and exciting hypothesis: sills are not just a passive medium for heat transfer to the surrounding sediment and concomitan t thermal alteration of sedimentary organic matter; instead, the sill matrix itself plays a chemica l role as a precipitation zone and storage medium for carbon. Consistent observations of calcit e precipitation in vesicles and veins in host sills suggest that sills catalyze carbon precipitation an d thus carbon sequestration within the sill itself. The carbon source remains to be identified; it ma y be sediment-bound pore water or seawater entrapped during sill emplacement or circulatin g through the porous sill, or perhaps it is of a more juvenile (magmatic) origin. Parallel observation s of large amounts of methane in porous sill host rock indicate a major carbon reservoir and sugges t that sills may act as a methane capacitor, with limited diffusion into adjacent sediment. Th e sources of the sill-hosted pore space methane—microbial production from DIC and $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ methanogenic degradation of LMW organic compounds, or hydrothermal reactions without direct microbial participation—remain to be identified. Calcite and methane represent the opposite redo x extremes of carbon, but the sill host rock also needs to be examined closely for chemically intermediate carbon forms, such as graphite, to complete the carbon inventory.  

Carbon sources and transformation pathways in the subseafloor biosphere are often microbiall y mediated, which leads to specific microbiological research questions. How does the therma l impact of emplaced sills influence microbial diagenetic reactions, for example ammonia or alkalinity generation from organic matter decomposition or sulfate depletion by LMW-oxidizin g sulfate-reducing microorganisms? Is there a connection between geothermal gradient and anaerobic metabolism? Metabolic acceleration could be a direct thermal response or indirectly triggered when warmer temperatures help to release LMW compounds from complex, buried organi c matter. On the other hand, heat stress could reduce microbial activity, as suggested by the muchreduced alkalinity and ammonia concentrations at the comparatively hot Ringvent sites, compare d to higher concentrations at the cooler northwestern sites and cold seep sites. Sulfate depletion a t the hot Ringvent sites could result from abiotic sulfate reduction at the hot sill–sediment interface, contrasting with microbial sulfate reduction and depletion at cooler sediment-hosted SMTZs a t other sites. Interestingly, shipboard cell counts show that microbial cell numbers in the sediment s are strongly affected by the local thermal gradient and decrease rapidly toward greater depths; th e slope of declining cell numbers appears to be steeper at the hot Ringvent sites compared to othe r sites. Cell counts in the upper sediment column remain at least near or above cell counts for passive continental margins without hydrothermal activity. Thus, the expedition results place th e general microbial questions that populated the proposal (thermal and chemical limits of life, limit s of specific metabolic pathways, etc.) into a specific hypothesis-generating context that will stimulate and guide multidisciplinary postexpedition research.  

The generally high quality and high degree of completeness of the acquired data sets open u p opportunities for interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary collaborations on studies that will kee p producing results and new insights far into the future. For example, it will be possible for the firs t time in scientific ocean drilling history to systematically explore correlations of cell abundance, community composition, and activity with geothermal gradients within the relevant thermal rang e (as high as ${\sim}80^{\circ}{-}100^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and over a wide range of lithologic and geochemical conditions usin g multiple sites and holes from the same region. Another area of highly promising data integratio n will be the combined lithology and geochemistry of the sediment–sill transition. Multiple examples were recovered during Expedition 385, where previously only a single transition (the top o f the major sill in Hole 481A at ${\sim}170\;\mathrm{m}$ subbottom depth) was available in any reasonable degree o f completeness. The mineralogy, geochemistry, and microbiology of the massive sills themselves ar e now within reach for individual studies as well as for collaborative ventures because the shipboar d microbiology group readjusted their originally sediment-focused sampling program to cover th e interior of sills as well. The hydrothermal influence on mineral dissolution, authigenic minera l precipitation, and mineral transformations can be assessed in multiple sediment columns wher e suitable thermal gradient information, high sediment recovery, and high-quality analysis of th e sediment composition and mineral phases coincide.
