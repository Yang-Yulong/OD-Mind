# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 36 0 was the first leg of Phase I of the SloMo (shorthand for “The natur e of the lower crust and Moho at slower spreading ridges”) Project,  a multiphase drilling program that proposes to drill through the outermost of the global seismic velocity discontinuities, the Mohorovičić seismic discontinuity (Moho). The Moho corresponds to  a compressional wave velocity increase, typically at ${\sim}7~\mathrm{km}$ beneat h the oceans, and has generally been regarded as the boundary between crust and mantle. An alternative model, that the Moho is  a hydration front in the mantle, has recently gained credence upo n the discovery of abundant partially serpentinized peridotite on th e seafloor and on the walls of fracture zones, such as at Atlantis Bank, an 11–13 My old elevated oceanic core complex massif adjacent t o the Atlantis II Transform on the Southwest Indian Ridge.  

Hole U1473A was drilled on the summit of Atlantis Bank durin g IODP Expedition 360, $1{-}2\,\mathrm{km}$ away from two previous Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) holes: Hole 735B (drilled during ODP Leg 11 8 in 1987 and ODP Leg 176 in 1997) and Hole 1105A (drilled durin g ODP Leg 179 in 1998). A mantle peridotite/gabbro contact has bee n traced by dredging and diving along the transform wall for $40\;\mathrm{km}$ . The contact is located at ${\sim}4200\mathrm{~m~}$ depth at the drill sites but shoal s considerably $20\;\mathrm{km}$ to the south, where it was observed in outcro p at $2563\mathrm{~m~}$ depth. Moho reflections have, however, been found a t ${\sim}5{-}6~\mathrm{km}$ beneath Atlantis Bank and $<\!4\;\mathrm{km}$ beneath the transfor m wall, leading to the suggestion that the seismic discontinuity ma y not represent the crust/mantle boundary but rather an alteratio n (serpentinization) front. This then raises the interesting possibilit y that a whole new planetary biosphere may thrive due to methanogenesis associated with serpentinization. The SloMo Project seek s to test these two hypotheses at Atlantis Bank and evaluate carbo n sequestration in the lower crust and uppermost mantle.  

A primary objective of SloMo Leg 1 was to explore the latera l variability of the stratigraphy established in Hole 735B. Compariso n of Hole U1473A with Holes 735B and 1105A allows us to demonstrate a continuity of process and complex interplay of magmatic accretion and steady-state detachment faulting over a time period o f ${\sim}128\ \mathrm{ky}.$ . Preliminary assessment indicates that these sections o f lower crust are constructed by repeated cycles of intrusion, represented in Hole U1473A by approximately three upwardly differentiated hundreds of meter–scale bodies of olivine gabbro broadl y similar to those encountered in the deeper parts of Hole 735B.  

Specific aims of Expedition 360 focused on gaining an understanding of how magmatism and tectonism interact in accommodating seafloor spreading, how magnetic reversal boundaries ar e expressed in the lower crust, assessing the role of the lower crus t and shallow mantle in the global carbon cycle, and constraining th e extent and nature of life at deep levels within the ocean lithosphere.  

# Summary  

and Wrinch and Jeffreys (1923), the Moho has generally been regarded as the boundary between crust and mantle; however, an alternative model, that the Moho is a hydration front in the mantl e (Hess, 1960, 1962), has recently gained credence upon the discover y of abundant partially serpentinized peridotite on the seafloor an d on the walls of fracture zones. One such location is Atlantis Bank, an 11–13 My old elevated oceanic core complex massif adjacent t o the Atlantis II Transform on the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR).  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 36 0 was the first leg of Phase I of the SloMo (shorthand for “The natur e of the lower crust and Moho at slower spreading ridges”) Project,  a multiphase drilling program that proposes to drill through the outermost of the global seismic velocity discontinuities, the Mohorovičić seismic discontinuity (Moho). The Moho corresponds to  a compressional wave velocity increase from ${\sim}6.7~\mathrm{km/s}$ to betwee n 7.6 and $8.6~\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ , typically at ${\sim}7~\mathrm{km}$ beneath the oceans. Since th e work of Adams and Coker (1906), Adams and Williamson (1923),  

IODP Hole U1473A was drilled on the summit of Atlantis Ban k during Expedition 360, $1{-}2\ \mathrm{km}$ away from two previous Ocea n Drilling Program (ODP) holes: Hole 735B (drilled during ODP Le g 118 in 1987 and ODP Leg 176 in 1997) and Hole 1105A (ODP Le g 179 in 1998). A mantle peridotite/gabbro contact has been trace d for $15~\mathrm{km}$ at ${\sim}4200\mathrm{~m~}$ depth along the transform wall ${\sim}11.5~\mathrm{km}$ t o the west. Moho reflections have, however, been found at ${\sim}5–6\ \mathrm{km}$ beneath Atlantis Bank, leading to the suggestion that the seismi c discontinuity may not represent the crust/mantle boundary bu t rather an alteration (serpentinization) front (Muller et al., 2000). This raises the interesting possibility that a whole new planetar y biosphere may thrive due to methanogenesis associated with serpentinization. The SloMo Project seeks to test these two hypothese s at Atlantis Bank and evaluate carbon sequestration in the lowe r crust and uppermost mantle.  

Located on the north-central part of Atlantis Bank, $2.2\ \mathrm{km}$ north-northeast of Hole 735B, Hole U1473A was drilled 789.7 meters below seafloor (mbsf) into massive gabbro cut by isolated dikes. The shallower part of the hole has been affected by faulting: in th e upper $469\mathrm{~m~}$ , seven distinct fault systems were encountered, ranging from $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ thick cataclasite bands to a $50\textrm{m}$ thick carbonateveined chlorite-rich fault zone. Over this interval, we obtained $44\%$ recovery under relatively poor drilling conditions. From 469 mbsf t o the bottom of the hole, however, drilling conditions were excellent, similar to Hole 735B, with $96\%$ recovery in the lowermost $212\textrm{m}$ interval cored (577.5 to 789.7 mbsf). Hole U1473A is the deepes t hole ever drilled from the seafloor into ocean crust during a single  2 month expedition. The hole is in good condition overall and, afte r minor remediation (including the fishing of a piece of steel droppe d in the bottom of the hole during logging at the end of Expeditio n 360), can be reoccupied during SloMo Leg 2.  

A primary objective of SloMo Leg 1 was to explore the latera l variability of the stratigraphy established in Hole 735B. Compariso n of Hole U1473A with Holes 735B (Dick et al., 2000) and 1105A (Casey et al., 2007) allows us to demonstrate a continuity of process an d complex interplay of magmatic accretion and steady-state detachment faulting over a time period of ${\sim}128\,\mathrm{k}!$ y. Preliminary assessmen t indicates that these sections of lower crust are constructed by repeated cycles of intrusion, represented in Hole U1473A by approximately three upwardly differentiated hundreds of meter–scal e bodies of olivine gabbro broadly similar to those encountered in th e deeper parts $(>\!500\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ of Hole 735B.  

The gabbro bodies in Hole U1473A are transposed by intens e locally pervasive ductile deformation, with extensive intervals o f sheared porphyroclastic to ultramylonitic gabbro (often Fe-Ti oxid e rich) forming a $600\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick crystal-plastic shear zone. Notably, shear sense is both normal and reversed in the upper section of th e hole but predominantly reversed in the lower part. Similar relationships are also seen in Hole 735B; all are probably a response of th e Atlantis Bank oceanic core complex to flexure during exhumation. Deformation is noticeably less intense toward the bottom of Hol e U1473A, with primary subophitic igneous textures often well preserved in the lowermost $200\;\mathrm{m}$ . Overall, the presence of such extensive crystal-plastic deformation in Hole U1473A and elsewhere a t Atlantis Bank demonstrates that magmatic accretion took place in  a highly dynamic environment, beginning while the gabbros wer e partially molten and continuing as they cooled and were exhume d tectonically from beneath the rift valley floor.  

The average composition for Hole U1473A is very similar t o Hole 735B, with $\mathrm{Mg}^{\#}$ of 71 and $0.7\mathrm{\wt}\%\mathrm{\TiO}_{2}$ . However, $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ contents averaging $1.0\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ , even in petrographically fresh samples, ar e much higher than expected for pristine gabbro cumulates. Most o f the gabbros drilled in Hole U1473A are olivine gabbro, with lesse r but still significant proportions of gabbro and oxide-bearing gabbro. The relationship between these rock types is complex and range s from simple interlocking igneous contacts between undeforme d gabbros with subparallel coarse to pegmatitic oxide gabbro layers, to isolated patches of oxide- and pyroxene-rich gabbro intercalate d with the olivine gabbro, to oxide concentrations that indicate loca l migration of late Fe-Ti oxide-rich melts along active shear zones. The  Fe-Ti–rich  oxide  gabbro  and  gabbronorite  occurrences, whether in layers and patches or within shear zones, appear to hav e crystallized from evolved interstitial melt compacted out of the olivine gabbro cumulates and record the migration of these melt s through the section. Evidence for percolation of more primitiv e melts through the section is also ubiquitous, with fine-grained microgabbros intruding or replacing the coarse olivine gabbro. Approximately $1.5\%$ of the section consists of late magmatic felsi c veins, ranging in composition from diorite to trondhjemite. Thes e may represent the final stages of fractionation of the melts intrude d to form the gabbros or may instead be produced by reheating an d partial anatexis of the section by successive intrusive events. Severa l diabase dikes intruded gabbros that had been altered under granulite to greenschist facies conditions. These include granoblasti c hornblende diabase dikes that may have partially melted the crystalplastically deformed gabbro host to form trondhjemite. Overall, th e bulk of the gabbros are too fractionated to be in equilibrium wit h the mid-ocean-ridge basalt (MORB) hanging wall, reflecting a complex evolution beyond initial intrusion of basaltic melt.  

The Hole U1473A section has undergone static hydrotherma l alteration, extensive recrystallization associated with crystal-plasti c deformation, and alteration associated with veining and with lat e cataclastic deformation. Static alteration occurs throughout th e hole, ranging from $-3\%$ to $90\%$ , with locally intense veining an d characterized by colorless amphibole, talc, serpentine, and cla y minerals after olivine; however, away from fault zones, much of th e section is very fresh. Formation of near-ubiquitous brown hornblende and secondary clinopyroxene reflect near-solidus conditions,  whereas  other  assemblages  reflect  amphibolite  t o subgreenschist facies. Clay minerals are the last alteration products, reflecting temperatures $<\!150^{\circ}C$ . Amphibolite facies alteration an d overprinting clay mineral formation are significant largely at shallow depths, whereas intervals displaying greenschist facies alteration are found sporadically throughout the hole. Carbonate with o r without clay and oxidative reddish clay replacement of olivine i s also more conspicuous in intervals disturbed by faulting, wherea s deeper in the hole microveins filled with chlorite, with or withou t amphibole, are more typical.  

Felsic veins in Hole U1473A often have high abundances of secondary sulfides and clay minerals as well as replacement of primar y plagioclase by albitic and occasionally secondary quartz, showin g that these were pathways for large volumes of hydrothermal fluids. This observation was also made for Hole 735B. A key similarity between Holes U1473A, 735B, and 1105A is the occurrence of amphibole veins, which is largely limited to the shallower sections of th e holes.  

Specific objectives of SloMo Leg 1 included drilling through  a magnetic reversal that was projected to lie several hundred meter s below seafloor at Site U1473: from reversely polarized at the surfac e to normally polarized at depth. Virtually all intervals drilled in Hol e U1473A have positive inclinations, indicating, in the Souther n Hemisphere, a reversed polarity magnetization that places the hol e within geomagnetic polarity Chron C5r.3r, as in Hole 735B. Magnetizations are sufficient to account for the observed sea-surfac e anomalies at Atlantis Bank. A clear reversal boundary was no t reached during Expedition 360; however, thermal demagnetizatio n revealed characteristic remanence with negative inclination (normal polarity) in narrow altered intervals in the lower part of th e hole, leading us to suggest that we are entering a reversal transitio n near the bottom of Hole U1473A. Three intervals with statisticall y significant differences in inclination downhole may document differential block rotations due to faulting.  

# Background and objectives  

Expedition 360 constituted the first leg of the multiphase SloM o Project that aims ultimately to drill through the Moho seismic discontinuity at Atlantis Bank at the ultraslow-spreading SWIR (Figur e F1). By penetrating this fundamental seismological boundary, th e SloMo Project will test the hypothesis that the Moho, at least a t slow- and ultraslow-spreading ridges, represents an alteratio n boundary such as the lower limit of mantle lithosphere serpentinization rather than the igneous crust–mantle transition (Figure F2) . If the latter, the igneous crust/mantle boundary could lie at an y depth above the seismic boundary.  

The site chosen for this deep drill hole is Atlantis Bank, an elevated flat-topped massif at ${\sim}700\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth on the east flank o f the north-south–trending Atlantis II Transform (Figure F3) (Dic k et al., 1991b). The Moho here lies at ${\sim}5.5~\mathrm{km}$ below the platfor m summit (Figure F4) (Muller et al., 2000). The principal aim of Expedition 360 was to drill as deep as possible through lower crustal gabbro and to leave a hole open and ready to be deepened durin g subsequent expeditions. A target depth of 1300 mbsf was originall y estimated, derived from prior experience of drilling conditions a t Atlantis Bank and assuming a nominal 4 days contingency time fo r weather and operational issues; however, this depth was no t achieved largely because the number of days available to us for coring during Expedition 360 was substantially less than planned (se e Operations).  

On the basis of local geological knowledge from site survey investigations, it was thought unlikely that the igneous crust/mantl e boundary would be encountered or a significant amount of peridotite recovered during Expedition 360 itself. The aim of future SloM o expeditions is to reoccupy and deepen the hole with the overall goal of penetrating the crust–mantle transition, which is believed to b e as much as ${\sim}2.5~\mathrm{km}$ above the Moho (see below). Additional drilling, potentially using the riser D/V Chikyu, is likely to be necessar y to penetrate the Moho itself at $\sim\!5\,\mathrm{km}$ below seafloor (Figure F4).  

The SloMo Project is not simply focused on the ultimate goal o f drilling the crust/mantle boundary; equally important is what w e learn on each step of the journey on the way. By recovering a substantial section of the igneous lower crust at Atlantis Bank, Expedition 360 was designed to address specific key challenges set out i n the IODP Science Plan 2013–2023 (http://www.iodp.org/scienceplan-for-2013-2023). This document, representing the consensu s of the global ocean drilling community, posits that in order to understand the inherent connections between the Earth’s interior an d its surface environment we must address fundamental question s about basic plate tectonic processes. Central among these question s are how seafloor spreading and mantle melting lead to the creatio n of oceanic lithosphere at mid-ocean ridges, and what controls th e architecture of the ocean crust thus formed (IODP Science Pla n Challenge 9). Constraining the composition, diversity, and architecture of the lower ocean crust and shallow mantle is critical to understanding the global geochemical cycle, particularly the exchange o f heat, mass, and volatiles between the Earth’s interior, oceans, an d atmosphere.  

At  slow-  and  ultraslow-spreading  ridges,  the  lower  crus t uniquely preserves that critical link where magmatic and tectoni c processes directly reflect plate dynamics, melt input, and the mantl e flow pattern. We now know that at such ridges a substantial portio n of plate spreading is accommodated in the lower crust by tectoni c extension due to faulting and, in places, ductile deformation (e.g., Mutter and Karson, 1992). Large-offset “detachment” normal fault s exert a strong control on melt distribution and transport in th e lower crust and delivery to the seafloor. This is in marked contras t to fast-spreading ridges, where it is accepted that the crust principally undergoes magmatic accretion by the injection of melt into th e lower crust, diking, and eruption of magmas on the seafloor; thus, rollover and corner flow by ductile flow accompanying mantle upwelling and plate spreading is believed to be mostly limited to th e mantle. However, at slower spreading ridges, which are cooler an d support only ephemeral magma chambers, the lower crust can potentially support a shear stress. As a consequence, with lower rate s of magma supply and colder, stronger lithosphere formed directl y beneath the ridge axis, slower spreading ridges have very differen t morphologies and crustal architectures. Thus, as stated in IOD P Initial Science Plan Challenge 9, a full picture of crustal architectur e and accretion can only be drawn if both fast- and slow-spreadin g environments are addressed.  

Specific aims of Expedition 360, the first leg of Phase I of th e SloMo Project, therefore focused on gaining an understanding o f how magmatism and tectonism interact in accommodating seafloo r spreading, how magnetic reversal boundaries are expressed in th e lower crust, assessing the role of the lower crust and shallow mantl e in the global carbon cycle, and constraining the extent and nature o f life at deep levels within the ocean lithosphere. These are explaine d further in Scientific objectives below.  

# Geological setting  

The SWIR with a full spreading rate of $14\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ lies at the slo w end of the mid-ocean-ridge spreading-rate spectrum. The ridg e trends approximately southwest–northeast for most of its length, spreading almost due north–south. Between ${\sim}52^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ and $60^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ , it i s offset by a series of closely spaced long-offset transform faults. On e of these, the Atlantis II Transform at $57^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ (Fisher and Sclater, 1983), offsets the SWIR sinistrally by $200~\mathrm{km}$ (Dick et al., 1991b) (Figur e F1). Between this transform and the Novara Transform ${\sim}140\,\mathrm{km}$ t o the east, the spreading axis is divided into two segments, AN-1 an d AN-2, separated by a $17~\mathrm{km}$ offset nontransform discontinuity a t $57^{\circ}20^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ and $57^{\circ}54^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ (Mendel et al., 1997; Hosford et al., 2003; Baines et al., 2007). The spreading rate here is asymmetric: at th e short westerly Segment AN-1 adjacent to the northern ridge/transform intersection of the Atlantis II Transform, magnetic anomalie s reveal rates of $8.5\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ to the south and $5.5\:\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ to the north, an d the transform has been lengthening by $3\;\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ for at least the pas t  

20 My (Dick et al., 1991b; Hosford et al., 2003; Baines et al., 2007). At ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , a $10^{\circ}$ counterclockwise change in regional spreading direction put the Atlantis II Transform into transtension for a perio d of ${\sim}12$ My (Dick et al., 1991b, Hosford et al., 2003; Baines et al., 2007, 2008).  

Immediately to the east of the Atlantis II Transform, parallel t o it and on a flow line directly south of spreading Segment AN-1, is a n elevated transverse ridge (Figure F1). It consists of a series of uplifted blocks connected by saddles that rise to as little as 700 meter s below sea level (mbsl) (Dick et al., 1991b). Atlantis Bank $\left(32^{\circ}43^{\prime}\mathrm{S},\right.$ $57^{\circ}17^{\prime}\mathrm{E})$ forms the shallowest and northernmost portion of thi s ridge, $95\,\mathrm{km}$ south of the SWIR axis (Figures F1, F3). The bank consists of a raised dome ${\sim}40~\mathrm{km}$ long by ${\sim}30~\mathrm{km}$ wide, rising fro m $5700\;\mathrm{m}$ at the base of the transform wall to $700\,\mathrm{m}$ on a ${\sim}25\,\mathrm{km^{2}}$ flattopped wave-cut platform at its crest and then drops to $4300\;\mathrm{m}$ o n its eastern flank across two prominent transform-parallel east-dipping normal faults (Dick et al., 1991b; Baines et al., 2003; Hosford e t al., 2003).  

Site surveys of the Atlantis Bank area have included multibeam , magnetics, and gravity surveys, as well as rock sampling using seabed rock coring, a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), submersibl e dives, and dredging (Dick et al., 1991b; MacLeod et al., 1998; Arai e t al., 2000; Kinoshita et al., 1999; Matsumoto et al., 2002). A high-resolution bathymetric map of the ${\sim}25~\mathrm{km^{2}}$ summit region compile d from narrow-beam echo soundings (Dick et al., 1999) shows th e platform consists of a broadly flat surface ranging from $\mathord{\sim}750$ to 68 9 m water depth (Figure F5). ROV survey results show the central pavement to be bare rock, locally knobbly igneous outcrop (largel y gabbro) surrounded on its periphery and locally on its surface b y limestone, in some places ripple marked, and carbonate-cemente d pebble conglomerate. Morphologically the platform is interprete d as a set of partially eroded sea stacks surrounded by beach gravel and limestone pavement (see below).  

Hole 735B is located at the southwest corner of the flat surfac e of the Atlantis Bank platform $32^{\circ}43.395^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $57^{\circ}15.959^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ , $731\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth) (Figures F3, F5). During Legs 118 and 176, the hole wa s drilled to a total of 1508 mbsf with $87\%$ core recovery, all in gabbr o (sensu lato) ${\sim}11$ Ma in age (Robinson, Von Herzen, et al., 1989; Dic k et al., 2000). Further operations during Leg 179 drilled the $158\,\mathrm{~m~}$ deep Hole 1105A in the center of the platform $\langle32^{\circ}43.13^{\prime}\mathrm{S},$ $57^{\circ}16.65^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; Pettigrew, Casey, Miller, et al., 1999), also in gabbro an d with similar overall core recovery rates.  

Employing the British Geological Survey’s $5\,\textrm{m}$ diamond roc k drill and $^{1\textrm{m}}$ “BRIDGE”-oriented corer during site survey Cruis e JR31 on the RRS James Clark Ross, MacLeod et al. (1998) drilled 4 2 successful cores on the surface of this platform region, recoverin g igneous rocks in 33 of them (Figure F5). The cores reveal continuous gabbro outcrop on the platform surface, with diabase at two locations  and  serpentinized  peridotite  along  with  pillow-basal t breccia drilled at its southern tip. The two lattermost occur wher e the flat platform narrows into a north–south spine $(32^{\circ}44.5^{\prime}\mathrm{S})$ . Many of the gabbroic rocks in the shallow drill cores and seen i n ROPOS ROV images from the surface of the platform are mylonitic, displaying intense crystal-plastic deformation with shallow fabrics. In Hole 735B, crystal-plastic deformation of oxide gabbro and olivine gabbro was likewise found to be strong in the uppermost $500\;\mathrm{m}$ but diminished markedly downsection (Robinson, Von Herzen, e t al., 1989; Cannat et al., 1991; Dick et al., 1991a; Miranda and John, 2010). Considered together, it is apparent that the upper surface o f Atlantis Bank represents a detachment fault damage zone representing a high-temperature “plutonic growth fault” active durin g the accretion of the gabbroic lower crust and responsible for its exhumation. This “hot” detachment must have rooted at the top of  a continuously replenished crystal mush zone close to the midpoin t of the AN-1 spreading ridge (Dick et al., 1991a, 2000; Natland an d Dick, 2001, 2002). Numerous inliers of dikes intercalated with gabbro occur across the eastern side of the bank (Figure F3), demonstrating that the detachment footwall passed through the zone o f active diking beneath the rift valley (Dick et al., 2008). Magneti c anomalies hosted within the gabbro massif indicate an age fro m 10.7 to $14.5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Dick et al., 1991b; Allerton and Tivey, 2001; Hosford et al., 2003); hence emplacement of gabbro into the footwall o f a single detachment fault must have been continuous for ${\geq}3.74$ My, accruing a total slip of at least $38.9\,\mathrm{km}$ (e.g., Baines et al., 2007). Inclinations of paleomagnetic remanence directions from Holes 735 B and 1105A and JR31 seabed drill cores are consistently ${\sim}20^{\circ}$ steepe r than expected for the latitude of Atlantis Bank and are interprete d as indicating a southward tilt of this magnitude subsequent to cooling of the section through the Curie temperature of magnetit e $(580^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ (Kikawa and Pariso, 1991; Dick, Natland, Miller, et al., 1999; Pettigrew, Casey, Miller, et al., 1999; Allerton and Tivey, 2001).  

Submersible observations at Atlantis Bank (Kinoshita et al., 1999; Matsumoto et al., 2002) show that the detachment fault surface is preserved over large regions in the deeper waters on bot h sides of the platform. The damage zone and underlying gabbro ar e well exposed by high-angle normal faulting on the eastern side o f the complex and in headwalls of large landslips on the wester n flank. Here, lower temperature fault rocks are present in addition t o the amphibolite facies mylonite. These chloritized and weathere d fault gouge and talc-serpentine schists, preserved locally on th e fault surface (Dick et al., 2001; Miranda and John, 2010), are ver y similar to fault rocks found on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge core complexes (e.g., MacLeod et al., 2002; Escartín et al., 2003, Schroede r and John, 2004; Dick et al., 2008).  

The absence of the low-temperature fault rocks on the flat surface of the Atlantis Bank platform compared to its flanks suggest s they have been removed, a deduction entirely consistent with th e long-held supposition (Dick et al., 1991b; Palmiotto et al., 2013) tha t Atlantis Bank was once an ocean island, and its flat top results fro m erosion at sea level followed by subsidence to its present level. Shallow drilling and dredging on the summit and uppermost flanks o f the Atlantis Bank platform have amply verified this supposition. Indurated carbonates were drilled at 24 sites from the periphery of th e platform and were also recovered in dredges from its flanks (MacLeod et al., 1998, 2000; Palmiotto et al., 2013). Although some (recent) carbonate sand was recovered, most of the sediments ar e indurated bioclastic limestone (skeletal packstone to wackestone; MacLeod et al., 2000) of Miocene to Pleistocene age (Palmiotto e t al., 2013). The sediments contain abundant macrofauna, primaril y bryozoans, mollusks, algal nodules, and echinoids, but also som e solitary corals. Benthic and, in some instances, large planktonic foraminifers are common. Whereas Palmiotto et al. (2013) suggest  a water depth of ${\sim}100{-}200\,\mathrm{~m~}$ based upon assemblages in dredge d carbonates from the flanks of the platform, green algal (dasyclad ) assemblages in drill cores from the platform summit (G. Della Port a and V.P. Wright, pers. comm., 1999; MacLeod et al., 2000) indicat e water depths at wave base or shallower, demonstrating that the platform was at sea level and probably above. How much material ha s been removed by subaerial erosion is not known, potentially $^{100-}$ $200\mathrm{~m~}$ with reference to the inferred thickness of the detachmen t fault damage zone. ROV observations of steep sides up to $10\;\mathrm{m},$ , locally even $50\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , at the gabbro pavement flanks on the platfor m summit may represent coastal cliffs and small sea stacks resultin g from the dispersal of wave energy on the flanks of the island durin g erosion.  

The Atlantis II Transform transverse ridge, on which Atlanti s Bank lies, is clearly analogous to oceanic core complex massif s found on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (e.g., Cann et al., 1997; Tucholke e t al., 1998; MacLeod et al., 2002, 2009; Smith et al., 2006; Dick et al., 2008), although here, as elsewhere along the SWIR (Cannat et al., 2006; Sauter et al., 2013), the prominent spreading direction–parallel corrugations that are characteristic of the flat surfaces of the Atlantic oceanic core complexes are not so obvious and are potentiall y present only on the down-dropped terrace on the eastern side of Atlantis Bank (Figures F1, F3); furthermore, the Atlantis II Transfor m transverse ridge was clearly uplifted far above the surrounding seafloor. Whereas flexural uplift of detachment fault footwalls to for m oceanic core complexes is typically $1\pm0.5\,\mathrm{km}$ relative to surrounding seafloor of similar age (Tucholke et al., 1998; Lavier et al., 1999), the Atlantis II transverse ridge has been uplifted by $3\,\mathrm{km}$ (Baines e t al., 2003). Dick et al. (1991a) and Baines et al. (2003) propose tha t the original detachment-related uplift at the ridge/transform intersection was accentuated by an additional phase of flexural uplift, imparted upon the transform in response to the change of spreading direction on the SWIR at $19.5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , and accommodated by th e reactivation as normal faults of originally transform-related north– south structures.  

One consequence of the Atlantis II transverse ridge relative uplift is that the crust/mantle boundary, as mapped by dredging an d submersible traverses, is exposed along its western wall for a distance of nearly $40\;\mathrm{km}$ (Figure F3). This boundary was encountere d at several locations during Shinkai 6500 dives in landslip headwall s and debris slopes. The boundary lies at ${\sim}4660\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth wes t of the drill sites but shoals considerably $20\,\mathrm{km}$ to the south, where i t was located in outcrop by a Shinkai 6500 dive at $2563\,\mathrm{m}$ water dept h (Kinoshita et al., 1999; Matsumoto et al., 2002). Upslope to the eas t of these dives, Dives 467 and 459 crested the landslip headwalls an d encountered the more gently sloping detachment fault footwall a t 3000 and $1755\ \mathrm{m},$ respectively, potentially indicating gabbro laye r thicknesses as little as 1500 and $2895\;\mathrm{m}$ . Elsewhere along the western flank of Atlantis Bank, serpentinized peridotite was recovere d in dredges from as shallow as $2000\ \mathrm{m}$ water depth (Dredge JR31- DR8), though in other nearby places only at $>\!3000\;\mathrm{m}$ depth. At th e southern end of the platform summit itself, serpentinized harzburgite was drilled at a water depth of $839\;\mathrm{m}$ (Site JR31-BGS12). Highl y altered peridotite sampled at several locations above the peridotite/gabbro contact on the transform wall consists largely of talcserpentine schist that likely overlies the gabbro massif. This and th e presence of serpentinized peridotite pebbles in sedimentary (beach ) conglomerates lying on gabbro near the edge of the platform suggest that a discontinuous talc-serpentine sheet was intruded alon g the detachment fault from where the fault cut massive peridotite i n the transform fault zone (Dick et al., 2001). This sheet is now preserved locally on the detachment surface. The serpentinite drilled a t Site JR31-BGS12 on the southern end of the platform, however, i s relatively massive harzburgite with well-preserved pseudomorph s of pyroxene. Possible origins of this particular serpentinite outcro p include a peridotite screen in gabbro similar to those drilled at Atlantis Massif in Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Hole U1309 D (Blackman, Ildefonse, John, Ohara, Miller, MacLeod, and the Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006), an enclave of less deformed and altered serpentinized peridotite in the original detachment fault shea r zone, or juxtaposition via a north-dipping ridge-parallel normal fault that demarcates the southernmost end of the flat platform a t $32^{\circ}44.4^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ .  

A wide-angle seismic refraction survey of the Atlantis II Transform region found the Moho at $5\,\pm\,1\,\,\mathrm{km}$ beneath Atlantis Ban k (Muller et al., 1997, 2000; Minshull et al., 1998) (Figure F4). The direct geological constraints outlined above offer strong support t o the inference that the Moho cannot represent the (petrological ) crust/mantle boundary in this region. Whereas Muller, Minshull, and colleagues also concluded that it could be a serpentinizatio n front, they based this conclusion on the geochemical argument tha t the igneous crustal thickness there was originally ${\sim}4~\mathrm{km}$ (base d upon rare earth element inversions), and with the basaltic carapac e removed by detachment faulting, the remainder was likely to be ${\sim}2$ to $2.5~\mathrm{km}$ thick. However, they admit this interpretation is nonunique, primarily because of the overlap in $P$ -wave seismic velocit y between gabbro and ${\sim}20\%{-}40\%$ partially serpentinized peridotit e (e.g., Miller and Christensen, 1997).  

At what level is the (petrological) crust/mantle boundary likel y to lie beneath Atlantis Bank? Projecting the detachment surface t o the locations of the traversed crust/mantle boundary describe d above indicates that the crustal thickness at these points prior t o mass wasting on the transform wall was significantly $<3\ \mathrm{km},$ whereas the depth to the Moho below the transform wall remain s approximately constant (Figure F4). Given that the elevated cor e complex massif is produced by flexure during uplift into the riftmountains because of a spreading direction change (Baines et al., 2003), it seems reasonable to conclude that the mapped boundary i s most likely to project approximately subhorizontally or even be elevated beneath the center of Atlantis Bank, consistent with the igneous crustal thickness of $2{-}2.5\ \mathrm{km}$ suggested by Minshull et al. (1998).  

# Scientific objectives  

Previous ODP operations at Atlantis Bank drilled $1508\mathrm{~m~}$ dee p Hole 735B and $158~\mathrm{m}$ deep Hole 1105A. Both holes recovered lon g sections of gabbro, consisting largely of olivine gabbro, subordinat e amounts of oxide gabbro, and minor troctolite and leucocratic vein s (Dick et al., 1991a, 2000; Pettigrew, Casey, Miller, et al., 1999). O n the basis of our previous site survey, we selected Site AtBk6, locate d on the northern edge of the Atlantis Bank platform $1.4\;\mathrm{km}$ north o f Hole 1105A and $2.2\;\mathrm{km}$ north-northeast of Hole 735B, as the mos t suitable location for a deep-penetration drill site (Figures F3, F5).  

Three contingency sites identified at Atlantis Bank were Sit e AtBk4 (serpentinized peridotite Site JR31-BR12) at the souther n end of the platform, Site AtBk5 in gabbro at the northern edge of th e platform, and Site AtBk2 in gabbro and dikes at $1700\;\mathrm{m}$ water dept h on the down-dropped terrace east of the main elevated platfor m (Figures F3, F5). These sites were envisaged not as alternatives t o the deep-penetration site but as single-bit spud-ins in case weathe r conditions were not sufficiently calm to allow the hard rock reentr y system to be deployed at the beginning of the cruise.  

Drilling at our principal Site AtBk6 (now Site U1473) during Expedition 360, in lithologies similar to those at previous drill Site s 735 and 1105, was designed to allow us to tackle a number of specific science questions (see below).  

# 1. What is the igneous stratigraphy of the lower ocean crust?  

Analysis of drilling results in Hole U1473A should allow us t o determine the extent to which the igneous, metamorphic, an d structural stratigraphy found in Holes 735B and 1105A is laterall y continuous across the wave-cut platform on Atlantis Bank. In combination with Holes 735B and 1105A and the existing surface mapping, new drilling should provide a 3-D and possibly 4-D view of th e lateral continuity and evolution of the lower crust and its emplacement process.  

# 2. How much mantle is incorporated into the lower crust?  

An unanticipated finding in cores from Hole U1309D at the Atlantis Massif on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge was the incorporation o f significant volumes of hybridized mantle peridotite within the gabbro section (Blackman et al., 2011; Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006; Drouin et al., 2009). Comparable screens of mantle rock wer e not found in either Holes 735B or 1105A. Does this reflect a profound difference between the two different mid-ocean ridges, perhaps due to different magma budgets or accretion mechanisms, o r is it simply happenstance that they were not encountered durin g previous drilling at Atlantis Bank?  

# 3. What are the modes of melt transport into and through the lower crust?  

Several different modes of melt delivery and transport were proposed on the basis of observations from Hole 735B cores. Thes e modes include small intrusive cumulate bodies, larger intrusiv e units on the scale of hundreds of meters, anastomosing channel s produced by focused flow and melt-rock reaction, and compactio n of late iron titanium–rich melts into shear zones where they hybridized olivine gabbro to iron titanium oxide–rich gabbro and gabbronorite. The continuity and scale of these features cannot b e determined from a single deep hole. Results of Expedition 360 drilling should further document the extent and proportion of these features in a younger section of the massif.  

# 4. How does the lower crust shape the composition of MORB?  

The complex stratigraphies found in Holes 735B and U1309 D differ in significant ways. What common factors, however, influenc e the composition of MORB? As in Hole 735B, recent work on gabbroic sections from the East Pacific Rise shows that the lower crus t acted as a reactive porous filter homogenizing diverse melts tha t were intruded into it and modifying their trace element content s prior to their eruption to the seafloor (Lissenberg et al., 2013). T o what extent does this processes operate uniformly at slower spreading rates?  

# 5. What is the strain distribution in the lower crust during asymmetric seafloor spreading?  

Asymmetric spreading produced by detachment faulting is no w recognized as one of three major accretionary modes at slowspreading ridges (symmetric, asymmetric, and amagmatic rifting). Although each of these is important, little is known of how magmatism and tectonism interact, and hence how lower crustal accretio n differs in these environments. To date we have been able to determine strain distributions with depth in two deep holes (Holes 735 B and U1309D) in two different oceanic core complexes (Atlanti s Bank on the SWIR and Atlantis Massif on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge ) and found them to differ significantly: far more intense crystal-plastic deformation is found in the upper $500\mathrm{~m~}$ of Hole 735B than i n Hole U1309D (Figure F6). We cannot assess the nature, extent, an d role played by high-temperature deformation during lower crustal accretion with isolated 1-D sections. Offsetting and drilling north o f Hole 735B will allow us to determine the continuity of strain distribution from Holes 735B and 1105A across the Atlantis Bank cor e complex and thereby assess the role and broader significance of synmagmatic deformation in this tectonic environment.  

# 6. What is the nature of magnetic anomalies?  

An important goal of Expedition 360 was to drill through a magnetic reversal boundary in oceanic crust for the first time and to determine what controls magnetic anomalies in plutonic rocks.  

Magnetic anomaly “stripes” are detectable across the Atlantis I I transverse ridge, including Atlantis Bank and its wave-cut platfor m (Dick et al., 1991b; Allerton and Tivey, 2001; Hosford et al., 2003; Baines et al., 2007, 2008). Whereas most of the platform is reversel y magnetized, as are the gabbro intervals of Holes 735B and 1105 A (Kikawa and Pariso, 1991), a narrow normally polarized zone $\sim\!2\,\mathrm{km}$ wide is present near its northern end. This zone is equated to anomaly Chron C5r.2n (11.592–11.647 Ma; Allerton and Tivey, 2001; Baines et al., 2008) (Figure F7). The zone is detectable on sea-surface (Dick et al., 1991b; Hosford et al., 2003) and deep-towed magnetic profiles (Allerton and Tivey, 2001), as well as in the JR3 1 seabed drill cores; however, the precise location of the boundary i n each case is slightly offset. Because the sea-surface magnetizatio n signal is derived from a much greater volume of rock than the nearbottom signal in the cores, Allerton and Tivey (2001) deduced fro m the sense of offset that the magnetic anomaly boundaries are inclined. They modeled the southern limit of the anomaly as a plana r boundary dipping ${\sim}25^{\circ}$ toward the south, suggesting that the surface represented either an isotherm corresponding to the Curi e point or the edge of an intrusion. Alternatively, the form of th e southern edge of the anomaly may have been modified by faulting: extensive brittle deformation and cataclasis is observed in shallo w drill cores from the location of the southern reversal boundary, possibly corresponding to a north-dipping east-west–striking norma l fault at the kink/narrowing of the platform summit at $32^{\circ}41.8^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ . I f so, the reversal boundary is likely to dip more steeply than the $25^{\circ}$ proposed by Allerton and Tivey (2001). For this reason, Hol e U1473A was sited at the northern end of the main platform, jus t south of this normal fault, to encounter the reversal boundary at a s a shallow a depth as possible.  

# 7. What is the role of the lower crust and shallow mantle in the global carbon cycle?  

Serpentinization and weathering of ultramafic rocks as well a s alteration of basalts are known, under the right conditions, to caus e the formation of carbonates. Such carbonates are present in th e form of extensive veining in serpentinized peridotite at the souther n edge  of the  Atlantis  Bank  platform (shallow  drill Site  JR31- BGS12/contingency drill Site AtBk4) and in partially serpentinize d and weathered peridotite from the southern transform wall a t $32^{\circ}50^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ (Kaiko ROV Dives 173 and 174).  

The extent of these reactions in the lower crust is to date largel y unknown. We do not expect that carbon sequestration will be a significant process in the lower ocean crust based on Holes 735B an d U1309D; however, the possibility exists that Expedition 360 ma y penetrate the base of the lower ocean crust, and thus offer the firs t opportunity to determine if carbon sequestration is significant i n the mantle below it.  

# 8. Is there life in the lower crust and hydrated mantle?  

A primary objective of the SloMo Project is to determine the microbiology of the lower crust, the potential serpentinized mantl e above the Moho, and the underlying mantle to address IODP Science Plan Challenge 6 “What are the limits of life in the subseafloor?”  

Starting in the 1990s, microbiologists accompanying ODP an d Integrated Ocean Drilling Program expeditions have documente d the presence of microbial life in deeply buried sediment and the basaltic basement (Fisk et al., 1998; Parkes et al., 1994; Mason et al., 2010). Evidence for active microbial life has been detected as dee p as 2458 mbsf (Inagaki et al., 2015), and the introduction of molecular biology into marine ecology has led to great advances in our understanding of microbial life below the seafloor (Biddle et al., 2008; Cowen et al., 2003; Inagaki et al., 2006; Mason et al., 2010; Edgcom b et al., 2011; Orsi et al., 2013a, 2013b). Much of the microbiolog y performed during ODP and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program expeditions has concentrated on sediment (e.g., ODP Leg 201 to th e Peru margin), with the notable exception of expeditions to the Jua n de Fuca Ridge (Cowen et al., 2003; Lever et al., 2013; Jungbluth et al., 2013), Atlantis Massif (Mason et al., 2010), North Pond (Orcutt e t al., 2013), and Louisville Seamounts (Sylvan et al., 2015).  

Because it was never expected that mantle rocks be encountere d during the first phase of SloMo, the aim of microbiology samplin g during Expedition 360 was to explore for evidence of microbial lif e at depth within the crystalline lower oceanic crust, about which little is known. It is nevertheless possible that indirect inferences ma y be drawn as to the likely processes at work at greater depths from  a microbial perspective from postcruise analysis of the gabbro s drilled during the expedition. Olivine-rich gabbros can host serpentinization, a process that produces hydrogen, which can serve a s an electron donor for microbial metabolism. Serpentinization ca n also be an abiotic methanogenic process through Fischer Tropsc h type reactions $\mathrm{{(CO_{2}}}$ reduction with $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ in aqueous solution; Proskurowski et al., 2008), thus potentially providing an additional source of carbon (in addition to carbon dioxide that may be present ) for life in the deep crust. Complex organic matter and lipids in serpentinites suggest microorganisms inhabit mantle rock exhumed a t the seafloor (Delacour et al., 2008; Ménez et al., 2012). In cores fro m Hole U1309D (Atlantis Massif), small subunit ribosomal RNA gen e sequence analyses indicated that heterotrophic microorganisms putatively capable of hydrocarbon oxidation are present in lowe r crustal rocks (Mason et al., 2010). Delacour et al. (2008) point ou t that organics in these systems likely have both biotic and abioti c sources. Abiotic synthesis of organics during serpentinization is  a way of providing energy to deep-seated communities, but inorgani c redox fluid-mineral reactions may also be mined directly for metabolic energy (e.g., Shock, 2009). Apart from energy constraints, th e distribution of permeability and fluid flow impose strong constraints on the presence and activity of subseafloor life that can onl y be accurately determined by drilling. During Expedition 360, microbiologists focused on exploring evidence of life using culturebased approaches, molecular analyses, and enzyme assays. Effort s were focused on rock sections showing evidence of alteration o r fracturing within all lithologies encountered.  

# Site survey  

The broad location of the deep-penetration SloMo legacy hol e that we were to drill during Expedition 360 was the north central part of Atlantis Bank, south of the inferred north-dipping fault tha t coincides with the bathymetric offset of the platform at $32^{\circ}42^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ . W e believed this location would be away from the influence of the faul t zone yet close to the (south dipping) magnetic reversal boundary w e inferred we would encounter in the subsurface; furthermore, i t would be sufficiently distant from Holes 735B and 1105A to allo w us to assess kilometer-scale variability of magmatic and tectoni c processes associated with lower crustal accretion.  

The site selected for deep drilling (proposed Site AtBk6) ha d been cored during the 1998 site survey Cruise JR31 as Site JR31- BR8, determined to be located at $32^{\circ}42.3402^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $57^{\circ}16.6910^{\prime}\mathrm{E},$ on th e basis of an acoustic transponder network deployed during Cruis e JR31 on the James Clark Ross (MacLeod et al., 1998). From a seafloor photograph taken from the BRIDGE drill camera the site wa s part of an extensive bare-rock pavement outcrop (Figure F8). Dril l Core JR31-BR8 consisted of $1.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of oxide-bearing olivine gabbronorite with a thin mylonitic shear zone.  

As soon as we reached Atlantis Bank following the transit fro m Sri Lanka, we headed directly for Site AtBk6. Once on site, an advanced piston corer (APC)/extended core barrel (XCB) bit, bit sub, drill collars, and 5 inch drill pipe assembly was made up and lowered to 668 meters below rig floor (mbrf). The subsea camera system was installed and lowered to just above the bit to conduct  a survey to select a site appropriate for drilling. The survey strateg y was to proceed in a square “spiral” pattern increasing at $10\;\mathrm{m}$ intervals away from the Site AtBk6 start point until a sufficiently fla t bare-rock spot at least $5\textrm{m}$ in diameter was located. The drill pip e and camera were raised and lowered by up to several meters as required by the seafloor morphology.  

No suitable site was found at Site AtBk6 or during the initial 5 0 $\mathrm{~m~}\times\,50\mathrm{~m~}$ survey (Figure F9); rather than the bare-rock pavemen t photographed at Site JR31-BR8, we observed white sediment plu s scattered dark (gabbro) blocks on a near-flat surface deepenin g slightly to the northwest (Figures F9, F10A–F10B). The reason fo r the disparity with what was previously observed at apparently th e exact same location is not known but probably indicates some absolute offset of some tens of meters in the navigation of the JR31 transponder survey.  

The initial $50\mathrm{~m~}\times\,50\mathrm{~m~}$ survey spiral revealed a dense boulde r field and possible outcrop at the southwestern corner of the box; accordingly, the survey was extended south and southwest by a further $50\,\mathrm{m}$ . Within this area, an irregular steep-sided outcrop of dar k gabbro was identified, north-northwest elongated, ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ wide b y ${>}60\;\mathrm{m}$ long, and rising abruptly by as much as ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{m}$ above the surrounding carbonate sediment-covered seafloor. The top of this outcrop was flat and formed either of bare gabbro exposures or else wa s covered by a thin cap of indurated carbonate. After further investigation of this flat bare-rock pavement following a total of $5.5~\mathrm{h}$ o f survey, a suitable location for Hole U1473A was found (Figur e F10E) at $32^{\circ}42.3622^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $057^{\circ}16.6880^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ $\mathrm{^710.2\mbsl)}$ ), $40\textrm{m}$ south o f the original start point.  

# Principal results Site U1473  

Hole U1473A is located at $32^{\circ}42.3622^{\prime}{\mathrm{S}}~57^{\circ}16.6880^{\prime}{\mathrm{E}}_{\mathrm{x}}$ , in 710. 2 m water depth on the north central part of Atlantis Bank, $2.2~\mathrm{km}$ north-northeast of Hole 735B and $1.4~\mathrm{km}$ north of Hole 1105A. During Expedition 360, Hole U1473A was drilled to a total depth o f 789.7 mbsf, recovering $469.4~\mathrm{m}$ of core with an average of $59\%$ recovery over the entire interval $(\mathrm{>}96\%$ over the lower $200\mathrm{~m~}$ of th e hole). This constitutes the deepest igneous rock penetration fro m the seafloor during a single R/V JOIDES Resolution expedition t o date.  

# Igneous petrology  

Hole U1473A cores are composed of a variety of gabbroic lithologies, from primitive olivine gabbros to evolved oxide-rich gabbros, cut by felsic veins $(\mathord{\sim}1.5\%$ of the total) and rare diabase dikes. Eigh t lithologic units were defined within the gabbroic sequence, primarily on the basis of changes in mineral modes, grain size, and textur e but also based on the presence and relative importance of other igneous features such as igneous layering and felsic material (Figur e F11). Magnetic susceptibility and bulk-rock geochemical variation s were also considered when defining these units.  

Primary magmatic textures of gabbros to ${\sim}400$ mbsf are mostl y erased by intense crystal-plastic deformation; when preserved, primary textures are mostly subophitic and locally granular. The mai n lithology is olivine gabbro $(76.5\%)$ , followed in abundance by disseminated-oxide gabbro $(9.5\%$ ; oxide content between $1\%$ and $2\%$ ), gabbro (sensu stricto; $5.1\%$ ), oxide gabbro $(3.7\%)$ oxide conten t $>\!5\%$ ), oxide-bearing gabbro $(3.7\%$ ; oxide content between $2\%$ an d $5\%$ ), and felsic veins $(1.5\%)$ . Oxide abundance decreases slightl y downhole, with the exception of the lowermost intervals (deepe r than ${\sim}650~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) within which a larger proportion of oxide-bearin g lithologies was recovered. Oxide-bearing gabbro and oxide gabbr o are usually characterized by strong localized crystal-plastic deformation; however, in contrast, those in the deepest part of Hol e U1473A (Unit VIII) are essentially undeformed. Formation of oxid e gabbro is most likely related to the percolation of late-stage melt s through an existing olivine gabbro framework, an inference that i s supported by the near-ubiquitous presence of interstitial brown amphibole and rims around clinopyroxene and/or olivine. When located around olivine, brown amphibole is also associated wit h orthopyroxene rims. These late-stage melt-related features are les s abundant in fresh and undeformed samples from the deeper level s of the hole. The felsic veins consist of leucodiorite, quartz diorite, diorite, trondhjemite, and rare tonalite, locally containing oxid e minerals. They tend to be concentrated in specific zones or horizons, with trondhjemite predominating deeper than 500 mbsf.  

Several diabase dikes were found at various depths in Hol e U1473A. They intrude gabbros that had experienced previous crystal-plastic deformation under conditions ranging from amphibolit e up to granulite facies. Most of the dikes have diabasic textures; however, the larger granulite facies dikes have local assemblages of granoblastic  brown  amphibole,  plagioclase,  clinopyroxene,  an d orthopyroxene near their contacts with the gabbro, reflecting recrystallization likely at $800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ or higher. Likely associated centimeter-scale dikelets may consist entirely of the granulite assemblage. From textural relationships, some dikes appear to have locally partially melted the adjacent gabbro to form the felsic veins.  

Igneous layering, defined by modal and grain size variation, i s well developed in Units II and VII (91–175 and 578–642 mbsf, respectively). Grain size variability in the layering is generally also accompanied by modal variation. In most cases, contacts betwee n different layers are subparallel to each other, though less commonl y irregular contacts are also found. The dominant olivine gabbro i s largely coarse grained but locally displays considerable variability, ranging from fine to very coarse grained. Grain size variations in olivine gabbro may be locally associated with igneous layering but ar e mainly found within irregular olivine gabbro domains with suture d contacts.  

In several respects Hole U1473A displays similarities to th e other two holes drilled at Atlantis Bank (Holes 735B and 1105A; Dick et al., 2000; Casey et al., 2007) (Figure F12). Similar igneou s processes operated in the genesis of the plutonic section as a whole. Most striking is the first-order observation that the plutonic sections in Holes 735B and U1473A are mainly composed of olivin e gabbro $(>\!75\%)$ with numerous intercalations of gabbros containin g oxides $\mathrm{\sqrt{\sim}}15\%$ of the sections). The level and volume of oxide an d disseminated-oxide gabbros vary considerably between the Atlanti s Bank drill sites. It is probable that more of the section was remove d by erosion at Site U1473 compared to Site 735, making direct correlation of the sections relative to the detachment fault surface difficult. Intensely deformed and/or oxide-rich intervals are abundan t in the upper portion of Hole 735B and decrease rapidly deeper tha n $600~\mathrm{mbsf},$ are abundant in $158~\mathrm{m}$ deep Hole 1105A, and althoug h present in Hole U1473A, occur intermittently downhole with  a larger abundance of likely related disseminated-oxide gabbro.  

Felsic rocks are also found ubiquitously across Atlantis Ban k (e.g., Baines et al., 2008) and at all three drill sites. These rocks ar e represented by veins or patches that are reported to be associate d with oxide gabbros in Hole 735B (Dick et al., 2000) and with olivin e gabbro in Hole 1105A (Casey et al., 2007) but are found cutting bot h rock types in Hole U1473A. Locally, some dike margins are invade d by felsic melts that were most likely generated by hydrous contac t metamorphism of the previously hydrothermally altered host gabbro. Other felsic veins may be the product of extreme fractionatio n of the gabbroic melts or even local anatexis of gabbros due to subsequent gabbro intrusive cycles (e.g., Koepke et al., 2004). Troctolit e and troctolitic gabbro found in Hole 735B and, in the first case, interpreted as representing injection of primitive melts into the crystallizing olivine gabbros, were not encountered in Hole U1473A.  

Another common feature of the three holes drilled at Atlanti s Bank is the occurrence of $100{-}400\;\mathrm{m}$ thick igneous lithologic unit s defined by variations in texture, grain size, mode, and geochemica l composition. These units are mirrored by variations in whole-roc k geochemical compositions, which reveal apparent upward-differentiating geochemical trends, as defined by decreases in $\mathbf{{M}}\mathbf{{g}}^{\#}.$ , Cr, an d Ni contents and increases in Y (Figure F13) (see Geochemistry below). Each of the lithologic units is in turn characterized by interna l heterogeneity in composition and texture on a meter scale, als o documented in the other gabbroic sections sampled at Atlanti s Bank. This heterogeneity was likely governed by complex interpla y between magmatic processes (new melt injections, fractional crystallization, melt-rock reaction, and late-stage melt migration) an d deformation.  

Taken as a whole, the igneous stratigraphies of Holes 735B, 1105A, and U1473A document directly comparable processes occurring in all three locations over a lateral scale of $>\!2\,\mathrm{km}$ and vertical scale of ${\ge}1.5\,\mathrm{km}$ . This leads us to suggest that this portion of th e Atlantis Bank plutonic section is relatively homogeneous laterally. Key features are (i) the occurrence of olivine gabbro as the principa l lithology; (ii) the ubiquitous presence of disseminated-oxide, oxidebearing, and oxide gabbros and their greater abundance at the shallower structural levels; and (iii) the presence of ${\sim}100{-}400\ \mathrm{m}$ thic k olivine gabbro units showing upward-differentiating geochemical trends that may represent discrete magma bodies. Whereas the different drill holes display striking similarities between each othe r overall, we do not attempt to correlate igneous units directly fro m hole to hole; instead, we prefer to emphasize the similarity in overal l igneous accretion processes.  

How applicable are the conclusions we draw from drilling at Atlantis Bank to other oceanic core complex gabbro massifs or, indeed, plutonic accretion processes at (slow-spreading) mid-ocea n ridges in general? In partial answer to this question, we may compare the igneous architecture documented at Atlantis Bank wit h that of the gabbro body drilled at Atlantis Massif, the oceanic cor e complex at $30^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Hole U1309D; Blackman et al., 2011; Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006). The mos t striking difference is related to the lithologic variability of the tw o sections. In particular, Atlantis Bank is dominated either by olivin e gabbro or oxide-bearing gabbro (only), whereas Atlantis Massi f contains a much broader range of lithologies, with a dominant lithology of gabbro (sensu stricto; Figure F12) rather than olivin e gabbro and lesser amounts of olivine gabbro and oxide gabbros. A n even more significant difference is the abundance of troctolite an d the presence of relict mantle peridotite horizons in Hole U1309D. Particularly significant are olivine-rich troctolites formed by reaction of mantle peridotite with basalt melt (e.g., Drouin et al., 2009), as well as minor dunite between the gabbro bodies, which were no t found at Atlantis Bank. These major differences in igneous stratigraphy at Atlantis Bank and Atlantis Massif demonstrate that significant variability exists in the mode of accretion and internal differentiation of magmatic bodies in the lower crust between oceanic core complexes, likely reflecting variations in magma suppl y and accompanying tectonic setting, spreading rate, and thermal regime along ocean ridges.  

# Geochemistry  

The Hole U1473A lithologies are dominated by moderatel y evolved olivine gabbro with Mg# between 82 and 66. Mg# co-varie s with other petrogenetic indicators such as Ca#, Ti, Y, Cr, and Ni. The variations in $_\mathrm{Cr}$ and Ni concentrations cannot be explained b y modal mineralogy but are attributed to the composition of pyroxene and olivine in the rock.  

Downhole variation plots show major discontinuities in Mg# , Cr, Ni, and $C a\#$ at ${\sim}60{-}90_{\cdot}$ , 300, and ${\sim}700$ mbsf (Figure F13). Th e discontinuities are interpreted as defining upwardly evolving unit s of magma intruded in individual intrusive events. The discontinuities are remarkably similar to those seen in Hole 735B (Figure F6 ) (Dick et al., 2000) and are interpreted as defining upwardly evolvin g units of magma intruded in individual events. However, oxide gabbros occur in centimeter-scale intervals throughout the section an d are significantly more evolved than the background olivine gabbro, providing evidence for the migration of late-stage melts over minimum distances of tens to hundreds of meters.  

The average composition calculated for Hole U1473A is ver y similar to that of Hole 735B, with $\mathrm{Mg}^{\#}$ of $71\pm3$ and $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ of $0.7\pm0.2$ $\mathrm{wt\%}$ . The average composition of the Atlantis Bank gabbros i s slightly more evolved than that of Atlantis Massif (Hole U1309D; Godard et al., 2009), although their standard deviations overlap. They are both, however, substantially more fractionated than th e bulk lower crust average calculated for Hess Deep (fast-sprea d lower crust) by Gillis et al. (2014), although we note that the Hes s Deep calculation is based on extrapolation from relatively shor t drilled sections and thus is only an approximation of the composition of the East Pacific Rise lower crust.  

Hole U1473A gabbros have $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ contents of $0.2–8\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ (mean $=$ $1.0\,\pm\,0.9\,\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , median $=\,0.8\,\ensuremath{\mathrm{\,wt\%}}$ ), much higher than expected i n pristine cumulates. Even petrographically fresh samples (thin section alteration intensity 0–2) have mean $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ contents of $0.8\,\pm\,0.6$ $\mathrm{wt\%}$ (median $=\,0.7\,\mathrm{\,\wt\%}$ ). The abundance of $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ decreases wit h depth and is therefore likely to be controlled mostly by deep an d near-pervasive infiltration of seawater through the crustal section. Examination of altered and fresh sample pairs indicates that the alteration did not significantly alter major element compositions o r the trace element concentrations investigated. This is consisten t with the infiltration of low-salinity seawater-derived fluids with limited potential for mobilizing other elements.  

$\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is below detection limit in many of the samples investigated, but concentrations of up to $2~\mathrm{wt\%}$ were obtained for altere d rocks in the carbonate-veining zone $(\mathrm{\sim}210{-}580~\mathrm{mbsf})$ . A surpris e was that four of the carbonate-rich samples investigated are dominated by up to $0.5\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ of inorganic carbon rather than $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . Thes e high concentrations are similar to the range reported for clay-ric h alteration of glass on the seafloor and may be related to clay alteration in the gabbros. The amount of organic carbon present is a factor of 10 higher than determined for the majority of serpentinite s investigated previously. This is an intriguing result and may requir e that low-temperature alteration minerals of gabbro be added to th e list of potential microbial habitats in the subseafloor.  

# Metamorphic petrology  

Hole U1473A gabbros show three distinct modes of alteration: (1) static hydrothermal alteration, (2) alteration associated wit h crystal-plastic deformation, and (3) alteration associated with cataclastic deformation.  

Static background alteration is pervasive, with alteration mineral abundance estimated from macroscopic description rangin g from $-3\%$ to $90\%$ (Figure F14). Although alteration mineral abundance may locally exceed $60\%$ in intervals of intense veining o r faulting $4\%$ of Hole U1473A cores), in $78\%$ of cores background alteration mineral abundance is ${<}30\%$ . This is very similar to the figure for Hole 1105A $83\%$ of cores contain ${<}30\%$ backgroun d alteration). Static alteration minerals consist mainly of (i) colorles s amphibole, talc, serpentine, and clay minerals after olivine; (ii) secondary clinopyroxene and brown to green or colorless amphibol e after clinopyroxene; (iii) colorless amphibole and talc after orthopyroxene; and (iv) secondary plagioclase and chlorite after primar y plagioclase. These minerals occur in different abundances in eac h core or hand specimen and indicate variable temperature conditions for alteration. Textural relationships document overprinting o f lower temperature over higher temperature assemblages during th e gabbroic sequence cooling. The formation of the secondary clinopyroxene and brown amphibole association most likely took plac e at near-solidus temperatures $(>\!800^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . Brownish green and gree n amphibole and tremolite/actinolite $^+$ chlorite $\pm$ talc assemblage s formed at amphibolite to greenschist facies metamorphic conditions $(700^{\circ}{-}400^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . The assemblage of secondary plagioclase $^+$ chlorite $^+$ pale-green amphibole (actinolite) with minor amounts o f zoisite and titanite indicates greenschist facies conditions $(450^{\circ}-$ $350^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$ . Serpentinization of olivine most likely took place at temperatures in the range $350^{\circ}{-}200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (i.e., lower than greenschist facies alteration but higher than that of clay mineral formation). Cla y minerals are the latest products of alteration at lowest temperature s $(<\!150^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . Downhole trends in background alteration correlate wit h the distribution of metamorphic veins outlined below.  

Amphibole veins and amphiboles replacing primary mafic minerals are dominant at shallower levels $(<\!240\,\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ , as they are i n Hole 735B, whereas carbonate or carbonate-clay veins are conspicuous at 180–580 mbsf (Figure F14). Oxidative reddish clay-minera l replacement of primary minerals is also significant from the seafloor to $580~\mathrm{mbsf}.$ . In these intervals, it is common that millimeterwide veins have alteration halos that are up to centimeters wide. A t deeper levels $(>\!580\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ , microveins filled with chlorite $\pm$ amphibole are more abundant than the millimeter-wide veins.  

Felsic veins are typically more altered than host gabbros. Th e most apparent feature is the replacement of primary plagioclase, and sometimes quartz, by secondary plagioclase, which has a characteristic whitish milky appearance and often has fluid inclusions. Together with association of a relatively high abundance of secondary sulfide and patches of clay minerals in these veins, this implie s that the felsic veins were pathways for large volumes of hydrothermal fluids, as also found in Hole 735B (Dick et al., 1991a), particularly  at  lower  temperatures  (subgreenschist  facies).  Loca l occurrence of biotite in host gabbros is evidence for metasomati c alteration related to felsic vein intrusion.  

Neoblasts formed by crystal-plastic deformation typically consist of olivine, plagioclase, and clinopyroxene with minor brow n amphibole and Fe-Ti oxide minerals. This mineral assemblage indicates near-solidus temperature conditions $(>\!800^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . Amphibolit e mylonites composed of brown-green hornblende and plagioclase, typically associated with minor Fe-Ti oxides, locally develop in thi n discordant mylonitic bands. Amphibolite facies mineral assemblages also occur in the halos associated with amphibole veins. Amphibolite mylonites and amphibole-vein halos show cooling of th e gabbroic sequence to temperature conditions pertaining to th e transition from ductile to brittle regime $({\sim}700^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ .  

Intervals recording intense cataclastic deformation have abundant carbonate and brownish clay mineral(s). Clays and carbonate s show textural relationships indicative of their simultaneous formation, and some of the carbonates show a signature of plastic deformation. These observations show that cataclastic deformation too k place in association with alteration at low temperatures $(<\!150^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ .  

# Structural geology  

The internal structure of the Hole U1473A cores reflects a complex interplay of magmatic and tectonic processes that span a broa d range of temperatures, from contemporaneous magmatic intrusio n and high-temperature crystal-plastic deformation down to late lowtemperature brittle faulting. As a whole, Hole U1473A samples  a $600\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick zone of intense crystal-plastic deformation cut by  a later brittle high-angle fault zone with a damage zone that extend s to ${\sim}570$ mbsf. The variety, distribution, and intensity of the preserved structures are consistent with synkinematic exhumation an d cooling in the Atlantis Bank oceanic core complex.  

Undeformed parts of Hole U1473A cores preserve weakly developed magmatic fabrics defined by the shape-preferred orientatio n of plagioclase crystals and decimeter-scale igneous layering. Th e transition from magmatic flow to solid-state crystal-plastic deformation is marked by an increase in plagioclase recrystallization an d common development of tapered twins and undulose extinction.  

Crystal-plastic deformation occurs throughout Hole U1473 A (Figure F15). In moderate to intense crystal-plastic deformatio n zones, the relationship of magmatic to crystal-plastic fabrics is obscured.  Crystal-plastic  deformation  is  extensively  develope d throughout the top $600~\mathrm{m}$ of Hole U1473A. In detail, the deformation is heterogeneous with meter- to 10 meter–scale zones of dominantly porphyroclastic shear zones separated by relatively weakl y deformed gabbros. Locally, deformation intensity increases an d true mylonitic zones can be found at ${\sim}200{-}210$ and ${\sim}220{-}230$ mbsf. Rare thin ultramylonites are heterogeneously developed an d commonly crosscut the porphyroclastic foliation. The dip of th e crystal-plastic fabrics averages $10^{\circ}{-}40^{\circ},$ , although, locally, the di p can progressively increase and steepen to vertical. Folding of th e fabrics is more common in the upper part of the core. Shear sens e indicators are dominantly reversed, an observation confirmed b y analysis of shear sense indicators in thin sections. Even in discret e intervals that display little or no macroscopically visible crystalplastic deformation, thin sections generally reveal weak crystalplastic overprints. The majority of these intervals reveal narro w zones of incipient plagioclase recrystallization, especially at th e boundaries of pyroxene crystals, and pyroxene microfracturing.  

Weak to moderate crystal-plastic fabrics commonly have  a strong shape-preferred orientation defined by large elongated plagioclase and pyroxene crystals. Given the limited amount of recrystallization observed it appears unlikely that ductile deformation coul d have caused the alignment of the larger crystals. Therefore, it i s more likely that plagioclase and pyroxene were originally aligned b y magmatic flow and subsequently overprinted by localized crystalplastic deformation. Additionally, the grain size layering may hav e acted as a favored planar anisotropy for a subsequent crystal-plasti c fabric to nucleate. In some examples, the layering has a strong crystal-plastic overprint, particularly when the layering has a moderat e dip. In other examples, the layering is “necked” and truncated b y ductile shear zones.  

The conditions over which ductile deformation occurred i n Hole U1473A range from near-solidus granulite grade to amphibolite grade (see Metamorphic petrology). The distribution of amphibole within mylonites is not restricted to the top of the hole an d extends to at least ${\sim}670$ mbsf. Several examples of multiple generations of crystal-plastic fabrics with variations in shear sense, di p magnitude, dip direction, and metamorphic grade can be observe d in Hole U1473A cores. In some examples, the older mylonite ha s moderate dip and reversed shear sense, whereas the younger crosscutting mylonite has a subhorizontal dip and normal shear sense. I n others, moderately dipping reversed-sense porphyroclastic fabric s are crosscut by subvertical normal-sense mylonites. In each cas e amphibole is more prevalent in the younger crosscutting fabric. Th e deformation mechanisms remain the same during granulite an d amphibolite grade deformation and are dominated by subgrain rotation recrystallization. This variability in crosscutting relationship s indicates a changing strain field through time, with the early crystalplastic fabrics primarily preserving granulite conditions, wherea s the younger fabrics reflect amphibolite facies conditions. That th e differences in metamorphic facies may be associated with differences in shear zone orientation and shear sense does not accor d with the prediction of simple extension at the ridge axis and suggests that the lower oceanic crust deformation path is complex an d protracted.  

Evidence exists for contemporaneous brittle and crystal-plasti c deformation. Fractures in clinopyroxene in Hole U1473A gabbro s are filled with plagioclase crystals, whereas magmatic ilmenite locally fills cracks in both plagioclase and pyroxene porphyroclasts, indicating that melt was present while fracturing occurred. This ca n reasonably be anticipated where the crystal/melt ratio is high, as  a load-bearing framework can form that can accommodate strain b y brittle deformation (Handy et al., 2007). In other examples, plagioclase porphyroclasts have fractures filled with fine-grained recrystallized  plagioclase  indicating  that  plagioclase  was capable  o f deforming contemporaneously by brittle (i.e., fracturing) and ductile (i.e., recrystallization) deformation mechanisms. These feature s have been described in granitoids (e.g., Blumenfeld and Bouchez, 1988) and are interpreted as the transition from magmatic to crystal-plastic conditions, during which submagmatic to crystal-plasti c foliations may develop.  

Amphibole veins, both brown (hornblende) and pale green (actinolite) amphibole, exhibit a wide variety of crosscutting relationships with crystal-plastic fabrics. Amphibole veins commonly cu t the crystal-plastic foliation at high angle and may transpose (bend ) an older crystal-plastic fabric, indicating that vein formation occurred at moderate to high temperatures. In other cases, older crystal-plastic fabrics may be simply offset across an amphibole vein, suggesting relatively lower temperature deformation. The relationship between crystal-plastic fabrics and veins is complex (Figure s F15, F16). Crystal-plastic fabrics are overprinted and offset by brittle fractures and local faults with dominantly normal shear sense; however, reversed shear sense is also observed in brittle structures. In most cases, the fractures and faults within plagioclase and pyroxene are filled with amphibole. These microstructural relationship s suggest that the brittle-ductile overprint occurred at lower temperatures, mainly ranging from amphibolite to greenschist facies conditions. Some of the shear zones contain Fe-Ti oxides, which ar e significantly weaker compared to silicate phases (e.g., Till and Moskowitz, 2013). We suggest that discrete parts of the shear zone wer e still deforming by ductile deformation mechanisms, whereas othe r zones were deforming by fracturing. The resulting microstructure s are characterized by coeval ductile and brittle deformation mechanisms that were activated by variations in the thermal gradient, composition, and grain size.  

Fe-Ti  oxide-rich  domains  are  heterogeneously  distribute d throughout Hole U1473A, as demonstrated by the distribution o f magnetic susceptibility, which is an approximation for the proportion of Fe-Ti oxide minerals (see Petrophysics). The relationshi p between deformation and the presence of Fe-Ti oxides can be cryptic, with examples of Fe-Ti oxides occurring in both deformed an d undeformed samples. There are 26 ultramylonites within Hol e U1473A to 789 mbsf, 18 of which correlate with a peak in magneti c susceptibility. Most susceptibility peaks that do not correlate wit h the presence of an ultramylonite instead correlate with the presenc e of a mylonite; however, the two largest contiguous zones of deformation, the $^{10\mathrm{~m~}}$ thick mylonites from 201 to 210 mbsf and fro m 219 to 228 mbsf, do not correlate with peaks in magnetic susceptibility and are Fe-Ti oxide poor.  

No clear evidence has been found from the cores for crystalplastic deformation having predated or been contemporaneou s with intrusion of the individual geochemically defined coarse olivine gabbro units. However, the felsic veins appear to have been synkinematic: some of the late-magmatic felsic veins were deforme d along with the gabbros, whereas others, themselves undeformed, clearly crosscut plastically deformed gabbro. The dikes that cut th e Hole U1473A section were intruded under a range of condition s likely ranging from upper amphibolite to subgreenschist facies conditions; although none exhibited crystal-plastic deformation, th e enclosing gabbros generally do. Taken together with the clear relationship between late evolved oxide gabbros and discrete shea r zones, it may be concluded that deformation commenced almos t immediately after crystallization of the main gabbro body or bodies, whereas late-stage interstitial melts were still present. Continuin g deformation led to the exhumation and cooling during extensio n along a detachment shear zone that formed the oceanic core complex.  

Seven discrete fault systems were identified in Hole U1473 A based on the presence of fault rocks and fractured intervals (Figur e F17). They range from discrete $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ thick cataclasites at the top o f the hole to a major fault zone at 411–469 mbsf. An eighth discret e fault may exist at ${\sim}570$ mbsf; otherwise, no faulted intervals wer e encountered at greater depths. In each case, the faulted and fractured zones correspond to intervals of borehole enlargement, reduced core recovery, increased penetration rates, and in som e instances to drilling difficulties (see Operations). The $50\textrm{m}$ thic k fault zone at 411–469 mbsf consists of chlorite-rich and carbonaterich breccias and correlates with an increase in carbonate veining. Taken in conjunction with evidence for a negative temperatur e anomaly in downhole logs from this depth (see Petrophysics), it appears that the fault zone controls an active hydrologic system. Carbonate veining is positively correlated with fault rock intensity i n most of the faulted intervals above and below the 411–469 mbs f fault zone (Figure F16). The downhole frequency of carbonate vein s increases toward the major fault zone and then decreases below it, correlating with the damage zone of the fault as defined by the fracture density of the rocks (Figure F17). The background alteratio n and olivine alteration increases with the degree of carbonate veining, suggesting that low-temperature olivine alteration is enhance d in the vicinity of carbonate veins. This is supported by macroscopi c core observations displaying the pronounced red-stained (oxidative) alteration of olivine in the vicinity of the carbonates (see Metamorphic petrology). These smaller fault zones may too be th e focus of active fluid flow.  

The following are the main structural conclusions from IOD P Hole U1473A:  

• Multiple generations of felsic veins, most with a crystal-plastic overprint, provide evidence for a protracted history of melt generation and deformation.   
• Hypersolidus magmatic fabrics and grain size layering provide anisotropies that preferentially cause the nucleation of crystalplastic fabrics.   
• A $600\;\mathrm{m}$ thick zone of intense crystal-plastic shearing is present within Hole U1473A (Figure F15). It represents high-temperature deformation related to the detachment fault zone; however, it does not correlate directly with the deformed interval at the top of Hole 735B.   
• Multiple generations of crystal-plastic fabrics with different orientations, shear sense, and metamorphic grade attest to a protracted history of ductile deformation.   
• Shear sense is predominantly normal in the upper $50\,\mathrm{m}$ of Hole U1473A but tends to be reversed at greater depths. This same observation is made in Hole 735B but with the transition at ${\sim}450$ mbsf.   
• A strong correlation exists between the presence of Fe-Ti oxides and that of mylonite, ultramylonite, and magmatic contacts; however, the modal abundance of Fe-Ti oxide does not seem to correlate with deformation, and weaker crystal-plastic fabrics tend not to correlate with the presence or absence of Fe-Ti oxide.   
• The transition from crystal-plastic to brittle deformation is associated with granulite to amphibolite and, in some cases, greenschist facies alteration by way of ductile, semibrittle, and brittle deformation mechanisms. The degree of greenschist grade deformation is, however, much less in Hole U1473A than in previously reported sample suites from the surface of Atlantis Bank (e.g., Miranda and John, 2010).   
• Amphibole veins are concentrated in the upper $400\;\mathrm{m}$ of Hole U1473A (Figure F16) and either deflect or offset older crystalplastic fabrics at a high angle. Brittle overprint of high-temperature crystal-plastic fabrics is relatively limited and restricted to the upper ${\sim}300\;\mathrm{m}$ of the hole.  

A $50\,\mathrm{m}$ thick high-angle fault zone, defined by several fault breccias, abundance in carbonate veins, enlargement in borehole size, and reduction of in situ borehole resistivity, occurs from 411 to 46 9 mbsf. A temperature anomaly associated with this zone suggests th e fault is hydrologically active. Six other smaller fault zones are identified at shallower levels within Hole U1473A (Figure F17). All corresponded to lowered core recoveries, increased penetration rates, and, in some cases, problematic drilling conditions.

Remanence measurements were made on archive section halve s from Hole U1473A. This generated demagnetization data at mor e than 12,000 measuring points downhole. Virtually all intervals hav e positive inclinations indicating that the sampled gabbroic rock s hold a reversed polarity magnetization, consistent with the interpretation of marine magnetic anomalies (Allerton and Tivey, 2001 ) that places Hole U1473A within geomagnetic polarity Chron C5r.3 r (Gradstein et al., 2012). Moreover, the sampled gabbros carry sufficiently strong magnetizations to account for the observed magneti c anomalies over Atlantis Bank.  

The archive section-half data were subject to principal component analysis (PCA) using a processing and filtering scheme designed to rapidly identify the highest quality highest coercivit y components for subsequent tectonic interpretation. The resultin g principal component data allow division of the hole into upper an d lower zones with statistically different inclinations (Figure F18) . Thermal demagnetization data from discrete samples subject to th e same filtering for reliability support this division. The boundary between major inclination zones corresponds to the fault zone observed at 411–469 mbsf, from a mean value of ${\sim}72^{\circ}$ shallower tha n 403 mbsf to a mean value of ${\sim}61^{\circ}$ deeper than 403 mbsf. A narro w zone of steeper inclinations $(\mathrm{mean}=73.3^{\circ})$ ) is also seen between 73 7 and 750 mbsf. Compared to the expected dipole inclination of $51.3^{\circ}$ , these results imply a significant but variable rotation of the Atlanti s Bank footwall since acquisition of magnetization, with the majo r change across the fault zone likely reflecting differential rotatio n across this structure.  

Although the greater part of Hole U1473A carries reversed polarity magnetization, thermal demagnetization of discrete sample s and alternating field demagnetization of archive section-half piece s reveals characteristic remanences with negative inclinations i n some narrow zones of altered gabbro (around $\mathord{\sim}564.$ , 678, and 74 9 mbsf). The presence of these zones within broader intervals of reversed polarity indicates (near-) complete remagnetization of thes e rocks during a subsequent normal polarity period. The timing o f the alteration cannot be uniquely determined from these data, bu t the presence of these components in the lower part of the hole suggests that the reversal boundary between reversed geomagnetic polarity Chron C5r.3r and normal polarity Chron C5r.2n may occur i n close proximity to the current bottom of Hole U1473A.  

# Petrophysics  

Core sections were measured in data loggers for magnetic susceptibility, gamma ray attenuation (GRA) density, and natural gamma radiation (NGR). Magnetic susceptibility was measured o n both whole-round sections and archive halves, using a pass-throug h sensor coil and a contact probe, respectively. The measured magnetic susceptibility varies over the whole instrument range (10,00 0 instrument units; i.e., ${\sim}0.1$ SI); high magnetic susceptibility value s $(>\!1000$ instrument units) are ubiquitously related to abundant magnetite in gabbroic lithologies. The dominant olivine gabbro lithology has relatively low susceptibility that does not exceed a fe w hundred instrument units. At the centimeter to decimeter scale, high values of magnetic susceptibility indicate oxide-rich intervals, seams, and patches.  

NGR from the gabbro cores is consistently very low $\boxed{\le}1$ count/s). Several isolated peaks up to ${\sim}10$ counts/s were observe d in the vicinity of felsic veins. In the lower part of the hole (deepe r than ${\sim}575~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ), these narrow peaks often correlate with the highest magnetic susceptibility signals, indicating the presence of magnetite in the felsic veins.  

GRA density estimates range from 2.1 to $3.2\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and averag e ${\sim}2.65\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Estimates are slightly less variable in the bottom of th e hole (below the major fault zone at ${\sim}411{-}462~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) than in shallower sections, with an average value of about $2.67\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

Density and porosity were determined for 186 samples. Grai n density ranges from 2.88 to $3.13~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and averages $2.98~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ . I t does not vary significantly downhole, except for a slightly highe r variability above the major fault zone at \~411–469 mbsf. Porosity i s generally very low; it ranges from $0.1\%$ to $4.2\%$ and averages $0.6\%$ .  

Compressional seismic velocity was measured at room pressur e and temperature along three mutually perpendicular directions o n $2\,\mathrm{cm}\times2\,\mathrm{cm}\times2$ cm cubic samples. A total of 184 gabbroic sample s from Hole U1473A were measured, $94\%$ of which were olivine gabbro. $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ ranges from 5930 to $7150\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , with an average of $6734\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ and an average standard deviation of $25~\mathrm{m/s}$ . Above the major faul t zone at \~411–469 mbsf, $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ shows a modest increasing trend ove r the interval $\mathord{\sim}280$ to ${\sim}400\,\mathrm{mbsf}$ , from ${\sim}6700$ to ${\sim}7100\,\mathrm{m/s}$ . This progressive increase does not continue deeper in the hole; below th e major fault zone, $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ is lower on average $(6646~\mathrm{m/s})$ than in the upper part of the hole $(6795~\mathrm{m/s})$ , with a similar range of local-scal e variability. Local trends of decreasing $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ over a few tens of meter s match trends of increasing porosity and correspond to more fractured intervals and fault zones. The measured apparent anisotrop y of $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ is generally low, ranging from $0.1\%$ to $10.9\%$ and averagin g $2.2\%$ ; the slowest average $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ of the three measured directions is parallel to the core axis $({\sim}6708\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ ).  

Thermal conductivity was measured on 86 samples from archive halves. It ranges from 1.77 to $2.52\,\mathrm{\:W/(m{\cdot}K)}$ and average s 2.28 W/(m·K). The standard deviation of the measurements is $-2\%$ $\left[0.66\%\right.$ on average). Olivine gabbro conductivities are in the sam e range as those measured during previous oceanic crust drilling expeditions. Deeper than ${\sim}450$ mbsf, the average thermal conductivity is slightly higher $(2.36\ \mathrm{W/[m.K]})$ than in the upper part (2.2 1 $\scriptstyle\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}])$ . This may partly reflect the general change in backgroun d alteration at the bottom of the hole; deeper than 570 mbsf, the olivine is less altered and secondary clays are absent (Figure F14).  

Downhole logs were successfully acquired at the end of drillin g operations using three tool strings: a modified “triple combo” (NG R spectroscopy, bulk density, bulk resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility), a Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic string (seismic velocity and electrical resistivity imaging), and an ultrasonic strin g (acoustic imaging). Each tool string also measured total NGR an d borehole temperature. The borehole diameter measured by the triple combo tool string shows significant variations in the upper par t of the hole to ${\sim}570$ mbsf and a much more regular and clean shap e deeper, where core recovery averaged $96\%$ . Intervals where the hol e diameter is very variable and/or out of gauge correspond to low recovery and/or faulted material identified in the core. The presenc e of fault zones at \~411–469 mbsf is indicated by low electrical resistivity and low bulk density. A negative temperature excursion recorded by the temperature tool on each run also places the base of  a major fault that introduces colder fluid into the borehole at $\mathord{\sim}469$ mbsf.  

In the bottom part of the hole (deeper than ${\sim}570\,\mathrm{mbsf}$ ), $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ averages about $6840~\mathrm{m/s},$ , significantly higher than shallower than 57 0 mbsf, where it is generally about $6300{-}6400~\mathrm{m/s}$ away from faul t zones.  

# Microbiology  

Microbiology sampling during Expedition 360 focused on exploring evidence for life in the lower crust and hydrated mantle using  culture-based  and  culture-independent  approaches, microscopy, and enzyme assays. Sampling efforts focused on core s with evidence of alteration or fracturing within all lithologies encountered. In total, 68 whole-round samples $\!\!\!\langle4{-}22\ \mathrm{cm}\ \mathrm{long}\rangle\!\!\!$ ) wer e collected  for  microbiological  analysis.  Adenosine  triphosphat e (ATP) was quantified from all samples and ranged from below detection to $5\,\mathrm{pg}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ (mostly ${<}1\mathrm{\pg}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ), indicating the presence of  a subsurface biosphere in Atlantis Bank. Samples collected for postcruise research include fixed samples for cell counts to quantify microbial biomass and frozen samples for DNA, RNA, and lipi d extraction to describe the diversity (DNA and lipids) and activit y (RNA) of the microbial community. A total of 38 samples were inoculated into as many as 10 different kinds of microbial media targeting specific prokaryotic iron-reducing microbes, sulfate-reducin g bacteria, sulfur-oxidizing microbes, archaeal methanogens, and eukaryotic fungi. These will be analyzed during postcruise research. I n addition, for 12 samples we established nutrient addition experiments testing nutritional constraints on microbial biomass in thi s environment. Enzyme activity assays were conducted using substrates for alkaline phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase, and arginine aminopeptidase at 15 sample depths in Hole U1473A. Thes e experiments are ongoing, but initial analysis indicates the presenc e of very low alkaline phosphatase activity, whereas enzyme activit y for both peptidase substrates was below detection.  

Finally, a new microbial contamination tracer, perfluoromethy l decaline (PFMD), was used for contamination testing for the firs t time. PFMD was run during coring operations for 10 samples an d was routinely detected in the drilling fluids, usually on the outsid e of uncleaned cores, and rarely above detection on the outside o f cleaned cores. It was below detection on the inside of cores, indicating that penetration of drill fluids to the interior of whole-roun d drill cores where we collected our samples is unlikely. We ran thre e runs of the commonly used tracer perfluoromethylcyclohexan e (PMCH) at the end of the cruise for comparison. It was more difficult to clean the core exteriors successfully with this more volatil e tracer, and PMCH was detected on occasion on core interiors.  

# Hole 1105A redescription  

During the 11 day transit from Colombo, Sri Lanka, to Sit e U1473 at Atlantis Bank, the Expedition 360 science party reexamined the cores drilled during Leg 179 in Hole 1105A (Pettigrew, Casey, Miller, et al., 1999; Casey et al., 2007). This activity involve d rigorously describing the cores and many of the accompanying thi n sections with the primary purpose of familiarizing the science part y with the material likely to be encountered at the new Site U1473, situated $1.4\,\mathrm{km}$ to the north. The science party developed template s for the description of the igneous, metamorphic, and structural features of the cores and thin sections to establish core descriptio n protocols for the new Site U1473 cores. An additional benefit of redescribing Hole 1105A cores is that the data generated are in a format directly comparable with those for Hole U1473A.  

In general, our findings were very similar to those produced b y the Leg 179 scientists; however, with a larger science party to wor k on the cores, some of the information collected is new. We includ e this information in a separate site chapter of the expedition repor t in the Expedition 360 Proceedings, as a basis for direct compariso n with the results of drilling at Site U1473. In addition, we were able t o make certain physical properties measurements on Hole 1105 A cores, including section-half magnetic susceptibility measurements, that had not been possible during Leg 179. It is important to not e here that the observations made on the Hole 1105A cores by the Expedition 360 scientific party augment rather than replace thos e made by the Leg 179 scientists.  

# Igneous petrology  

Our observations on the igneous petrology of this section ar e summarized below and then briefly compared with those mad e during Leg 179. The 30 cores recovered from Hole 1105A are composed of gabbroic rocks and related felsic veins (Pettigrew, Casey, Miller, et al., 1999; Casey et al., 2007). The gabbroic rocks are mostl y coarse grained with subophitic to granular textures and are variabl y deformed. Subophitic textures dominate in undeformed samples. The main lithologies are oxide gabbro and olivine gabbro, followe d in abundance by gabbro (sensu stricto). A significant proportion o f the olivine gabbro and gabbro intervals contain small amounts o f oxides and are referred to as disseminated-oxide gabbro $(1\%-2\%$ oxides) and oxide-bearing gabbro $(2\%-5\%$ oxides). On the whole, gabbroic rocks with oxides ${>}1\%$ dominate deeper than $35\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ an d they tend to be more plastically deformed than other lithologies. Oxides are particularly abundant and probably crystallized fro m percolating evolved melts. In these deformed gabbros, oxides ar e not obviously affected by plastic deformation, and thus apparentl y crystallized after dynamic recrystallization of the silicates. Som e rare undeformed oxide gabbros are also observed. Thin intrusion s of fine-grained olivine gabbro occur between 60 and 75 mbsf. Numerous felsic veins occur throughout the core and are concentrate d at 15–65 and 138–158 mbsf. Detailed observations of the corresponding thin sections allow us to document the evolution of latestage melts within a crystallizing mush and to track the origin o f magmatic oxide minerals where they are particularly enriched.  

When compared with Hole 735B gabbros (Robinson, Von Herzen, et al., 1989; Dick, Natland, Miller, et al., 1999), Hole 1105A i s more enriched in oxide-bearing varieties (disseminated-oxide gabbro, oxide-bearing gabbro, or oxide gabbro) and therefore represents a section of crust that is more evolved overall than tha t recovered in Hole 735B. The oxide-rich section of Hole 1105A i s both thicker and more enriched in oxides than the principal oxiderich portions of Hole 735B (Units III and IV; 170.2–274.1 mbsf). Deformation grade and alteration patterns are also different, and  a downhole differentiation trend similar to that observed for Hol e 735B oxide gabbro is questionable for Hole 1105A whole-rock compositions but may be more evident when considering mineral compositions (Dick, Natland, Miller, et al., 1999; Dick et al., 2002; Pettigrew, Casey, Miller, et al., 1999; Casey et al., 2007). If the Hol e 1105A section is equivalent to any portion of Hole 735B, the mos t likely candidate would be Units III and IV (170.2–274.1 mbsf; Case y et al., 2007). Nevertheless, given the mismatch in comparisons presented above and as discussed in Casey et al. (2007), Hole 1105 A may not represent a single layer connected directly with Hole 735B; rather, it may instead record the manifestation of a similar process, dominated by the percolation of evolved melts that have the potential to precipitate oxides and concentrate them in high-porosity regions located in the shallowest levels of the sections. In Hole 735B, these regions clearly correspond to units affected by crystal-plasti c deformation; however, such a relationship is less evident in Hol e 1105A. The shallowest section of Hole 1105A (15–40 mbsf) is composed of material that is less evolved (olivine gabbro) and less deformed than in the deeper sections and is similar to several unit s recovered lower in Hole 735B. In Hole 735B, most felsic veins ar e associated with oxide gabbro (e.g., Natland et al., 1991), a relationship that is not observed in Hole 1105A.  

When compared with results of Leg 179 (Pettigrew, Casey , Miller, et al., 1999), we have defined fewer intervals: 108 during Expedition 360 versus 141 during Leg 179. Their modal content estimates are on average also quite different from ours, resulting i n different proportions of rock types (olivine gabbro was $39\%$ durin g Expedition 360 versus $43\%$ during Leg 179, gabbro was $21\%$ versu s $36\%$ , respectively, and oxide gabbro was $41\%$ versus $21\%$ , respectively). Our values as presented above have been adjusted to matc h Leg 179 descriptions, since during Leg 179 disseminated-oxide gabbro (defined as having oxide content from $1\%$ to $2\%$ ) and oxidebearing gabbros (oxide content from $2\%$ to $5\%$ ) were include d within the gabbros.  

The units defined for Hole 1105A during Leg 179 and Expedition 360 are relatively similar to each other. Four units were define d both during Leg 179 (two subunits in Unit II) and during Expeditio n 360. The transition between Units I and II are relatively close $_{<10}$ m difference), the transition between Units IIA and IIB of Leg 17 9 and between corresponding Units II and III of Expedition 360 als o differ by ${<}10\;\mathrm{m}_{:}$ , and the transition between Units IIB and III of Le g 179 is $4\textrm{m}$ deeper than the transition between Units III and IV o f Expedition 360. Leg 179 scientists also defined a Unit IV in th e deepest part of Hole 1105A, but this distinction was not mad e during Expedition 360.  

# Metamorphic petrology  

Most gabbros in Hole 1105A $(83\%)$ have $<\!30\;\mathrm{vol}\%$ of secondar y minerals formed by static alteration; intervals of extensive static alteration $(\ge\!60\,\mathrm{vol}\%)$ ) are rare ( ${<}3\%$ of the total). The intensity of stati c alteration shows no trend with depth in the hole. Olivine and plagioclase are generally the most and the least altered phases, respectively. Plagioclase is substantially altered only where the host roc k shows intense veining or cataclasis. Felsic veins tend to be substantially more altered than their host gabbros.  

High-temperature alteration is largely associated with crystalplastic deformation. The neoblastic minerals (plagioclase, olivine, and clinopyroxene, the latter locally associated with minor brow n amphibole) document crystal-plastic deformation under granulit e to upper amphibolite facies conditions. The high-temperature alteration is also locally manifested by static replacement of magmati c clinopyroxene by secondary clinopyroxene and minor brown hornblende.  

Subsequent phases of metamorphism are recorded in veins an d by static alteration minerals. Veins filled with brownish green hornblende forming up to $1\ \mathrm{mm}$ long crystals are presumed to hav e formed under amphibolite facies conditions. Other veins are characterized by pale-green actinolitic amphibole needles associate d with chlorite. These veins likely developed under greenschist facie s conditions.  

The moderate-temperature static alteration minerals vary i n conjunction with the primary mineral. In particular, variable replacement modes were observed for olivine. Olivine is commonl y altered to talc and minor oxide aggregates, frequently with an oute r rim of chlorite where it is in contact with plagioclase. A less frequent mode of olivine alteration is represented by local aggregate s of chlorite and pale-green amphibole in coronae along plagioclas e contacts. Clinopyroxene is altered along rims, cleavage surfaces, and microveins into green to pale-green amphibole. Plagioclase hydrothermal alteration is mostly confined to development of chlorit e along the contacts with primary mafic minerals and within microveins, in many instances in association with minor secondar y plagioclase.  

Abundant veins filled with clay minerals record hydrotherma l alteration under oxidative subgreenschist facies conditions. Veins o f this type are conspicuous in a few intervals in association with significant cataclastic deformation. In these intervals, olivine and pyroxene are mainly replaced by reddish brown clay minerals or b y mixtures of clay and iron oxyhydroxides. Similar clay and carbonat e veins and brownish clay pseudomorphs after olivine and pyroxen e occur in host gabbros near the cataclastic zones. Low-temperatur e carbonate veins are also present toward the bottom of Hole 1105A.  

# Structural geology  

The distribution and intensity of structures in Hole 1105A— magmatic contacts, veins, and fabrics; crystal-plastic fabrics; alteration veins; cataclastic material and fractures—represent a continuous record of deformation from ductile to brittle. The proportio n and overall intensity of gabbroic rocks displaying crystal-plastic fabrics increases downhole, from decimeter-thick discrete mylonites i n the top 80 mbsf to meter-thick gneissic porphyroclastic shear zone s deeper than 80 mbsf. Intervals of mylonite and ultramylonite, whic h may overprint earlier magmatic fabrics, are characterized by elongated bands of plagioclase intercalated with bands of pyroxene an d are commonly Fe-Ti oxide rich. Crystal-plastic fabrics are shallowl y to moderately inclined and commonly display reversed shear sense, although normal shear sense does occur. Fe-Ti oxides are abundan t in many samples, ranging from deformed to undeformed, and concentrate near magmatic contacts. Eighty percent of magnetic susceptibility peaks correlate with intervals that contain some evidenc e for crystal-plastic deformation.  

Magmatic  fabrics (shape-preferred primary  orientations  o f elongate crystals) are commonly overprinted and obscured by subsequent, near-penetrative crystal-plastic fabrics. Where magmati c fabrics do occur, they are weakly developed. Typically, they are inclined and better developed in finer grained rocks and near magmatic  contacts.  Magmatic  contacts  range  from  intrusive  t o gradational and sheared, with the majority of contacts being gradational, defined by grain size or modal variations. Magmatic veins ar e common throughout the top and bottom of Hole 1105A (15–65 an d 138–158 mbsf) and are absent from the middle part of the sectio n (65–138 mbsf). Most of the magmatic veins crosscut a previou s crystal-plastic fabric and are not themselves plastically deformed; however, in a few instances leucocratic gabbroic veins are observe d that have a mylonitic overprint. In some cases, deformation is confined to the vein, whereas the host gabbro is apparently undeformed.  These  intrusive  relationships  indicate  at  least  tw o generations of melt input and deformation. The distribution o f magmatic vein dips is bimodal, similar to that seen in Hole 735B.  

Five fractured zones are identified in Hole 1105A, two of whic h are fault zones. These fault zones (at 112 and 127 mbsf) are each ${\sim}5$ m thick fractured intervals surrounding a core of fault breccia. Discrete fractures are generally planar, some with slickensides. Th e slickenlines have a steep to moderate rake, indicating oblique to dipslip. The dip magnitude distribution is not random.  

Alteration veins vary in orientation as well as mineralogy: amphibole veins tend to be moderately to steeply inclined, wherea s carbonate and clay veins are generally subhorizontal. Amphibol e veins are most common at 40–50, 60–70, and 120–130 mbsf, intervals in which other vein fills are rare. Incomplete fill of calcite an d clay veins and the correlation of these veins with zones of fracturin g are indicative of low-temperature potentially recent fluid flo w through the fracture systems. This is consistent with measure d downhole logging temperature anomalies at 104–105 and 135–13 6 mbsf (Pettigrew, Casey, Miller, et al., 1999).  

The relative ages, distributions, and orientations of structures , ranging from magmatic contacts to brittle faults, document a downtemperature continuum of deformation, spanning the entire histor y from magmatic accretion to exhumation. Perhaps the most strikin g observation is the absence in Hole 1105A of a coherent high-strai n porphyroclastic to mylonitic shear zone at the seafloor directl y comparable to that documented in Hole 735B 1.2 km to the eastnortheast (Robinson, Von Herzen, et al., 1989; Dick et al., 1991a). Given the generally accepted interpretation of Atlantis Bank as a n oceanic core complex, the apparent absence of detachment faul t shearing at the surface of the platform might best be explained b y erosion following the earlier uplift of Atlantis Bank to sea level. Erosion might also explain the absence of a significant brittle overprin t at the top of the hole. Most likely, the high-temperature deformation exhibited in Hole 1105A represents a slightly deeper part of th e damage zone related to the detachment shear zone below the ridg e axis.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Remanence measurements were made on archive halves fro m Hole 1105A. These had previously been demagnetized at a maximum field of only $20~\mathrm{mT}$ during Leg 179; hence, during Expeditio n 360 we were able to conduct further stepwise demagnetization u p to $50~\mathrm{{mT}}$ . We thereby generated demagnetization data at $>\!2500$ measurement points downhole. These data were subject to PCA using a processing and filtering scheme designed to rapidly identif y the highest quality demagnetization data for subsequent tectoni c interpretation. Piece-averaged principal components have a mea n inclination of $72.5^{\circ}$ (determined from 346 archive-half pieces). Thi s value is in good agreement with those obtained previously at Sit e 753B (71.1°) and from seabed rock drill samples (Allerton and Tivey, 2001). Compared to the expected dipole inclination of $51.3^{\circ}$ , the results imply a consistent minimum rotation of the Atlantis Ban k footwall of ${\sim}20^{\circ}$ since acquisition of magnetization.  

# Petrophysics  

New physical properties measurements on section halves an d section-half pieces from Hole 1105A were acquired and integrate d with the new shipboard core descriptions. Using equipment no t available to Leg 179 scientists, we measured point magnetic susceptibility on archive halves and thermal conductivity on discrete samples.  

The mean magnetic susceptibility of rocks recovered in Hol e 1105A is 1800 instrument units (i.e., ${\sim}1800\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI},$ ). Several intervals have susceptibility much greater than the average value fo r Hole 1105A and correspond to intervals with a higher abundance o f magnetite in oxide or oxide-bearing (olivine) gabbro.  

Thermal conductivity was measured on 28 gabbro pieces take n at irregularly spaced intervals along Hole 1105A. Measured value s range  from  1.804  to  2.981  W/(m·K),  with  an  average  o f $2.16\:\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ . This limited data set from the shallow portion of th e section at Atlantis Bank does not show any relation between roc k type or alteration and thermal conductivity.  

# Operations  

Expedition 360 was of 61 operational days’ duration (30 November 2015–30 January 2016). The expedition achieved the deepest igneous rock penetration from the seafloor on a single JOIDE S Resolution expedition to date (789.7 mbsf) and recovered $469.4\:\mathrm{m}$ o f core $59\%$ recovery over the entire interval). The sequence of operational events can be grouped into eight successive episodes (Figur e F19; Tables T1, T2).  

# Summary  

# Port call and transit to Site U1473 (30 November–16 December)  

Expedition 360 spent the first 5.6 days in port in Colombo, Sr i Lanka, to offload and load samples, equipment, and supplies. Th e $2817\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1473 took 10.9 days.  

# Seafloor survey and installing the reentry system (17–19 December)  

We established a reentry system using a drill-in casing assembl y with a mud motor and underreamer and completed it with a freefall funnel, at a water depth of $710.2\;\mathrm{m}$ . Following a 1.0 day seafloo r survey to select the exact drill site, the method and design used fo r the Site U1473 reentry system took only 1.5 days to install. Th e drilled depth is 9.5 mbsf, the casing shoe is at 7.4 mbsf, and the to p of the cone is at $703.2~\mathrm{mbsl}$ ( $7.0~\mathrm{m}$ above the seafloor). The casin g was not cemented into the hole and the reentry installation prove d stable throughout the expedition.  

# First coring episode (19–30 December)  

During this successful 10.3 day coring episode (including 0. 6 days waiting on weather [WOW[) we retrieved Cores 360-U1473A2R through 44R (9.5–410.2 mbsf) with a recovery of $207.0\;\mathrm{m}\;(52\%)$ , using four rotary core barrel (RCB) drilling bits. Projecting the advance per day of this episode (including WOW) to the total remaining coring time, we would have reached a total depth of $>\!1200\,\mathrm{mbsf},$ close to the 1300 mbsf precruise estimate.  

# Fishing for roller cones and medical evacuation (30 December– 7 January)  

Three roller cones were lost in problematic coring conditions a t the end of the previous episode while cutting Core 360-U1473A44R. We made a total of four fishing attempts, first with two fishin g magnet runs, then with two reverse circulation junk basket (RCJB ) runs, for a total of 2.8 days, without recovering any cones. However, to everyone’s surprise, the last RCJB run recovered an unprecedented $_{0.5\mathrm{~m~}}$ long, $18~\mathrm{cm}$ diameter core (Core 45M, 410.2–410. 8 mbsf). This made it extremely unlikely that we had a roller cone lef t at the bottom of the hole and we hence decided to resume coring.  

Between the first and second fishing run we were obliged to sai l to a helicopter rendezvous site near Mauritius for a medical emergency. The $1320\ \mathrm{nmi}$ round-trip consumed 5.5 days of operationa l time.  

# Second coring episode and two roller cones lost and found (7– 12 January)  

Cores 360-U1473A-46R through 55R (410.8–481.7 mbsf) wer e retrieved with a total recovery of $20.0\mathrm{~m~}(28\%)$ . Penetration rate s were high, recovery was low, and cores were highly fractured, indicating a weak (faulted) formation. Because of excessive torque an d the need for a wiper trip and reaming the hole, we decided to retrieve the drill string, to discover that the RCB bit was missing on e of its four roller cones. The second of two RCJB fishing runs tha t followed recovered one missing roller cone but left three lost cone s still unaccounted for. We decided to resume coring; however, Core s 53R through 55R (469.6–481.7 mbsf) had zero recovery. Deployment of depluggers had no effect. We retrieved the drill string an d found that the bit had damage attributable to a roller cone. We deployed the fishing magnet and recovered a heavily abraded rolle r cone that had evidently been stuck in the center of the drill bit an d prevented advance and recovery.  

# Drilling ahead (12–13 January)  

We decided to drill ahead without coring for an interval not t o exceed $100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ using a tricone bit, which is more robust than th e RCB coring bit and therefore more suitable to mitigate potential issues near the bottom of the hole, such as reaming a slightly tigh t hole. We also wanted to get an idea of how much faster drillin g would deepen the hole compared to coring. We drilled ahead fro m 481.7 to 519.2 mbsf $(37.5\ \mathrm{m})$ ), found that the advance rate was no t greater compared to that of coring, and after 1.3 days decided therefore to resume coring.  

# Third coring episode (13–23 January)  

During this coring episode of 9.9 days (including 0.6 day whe n the pipe was stuck in the hole at 651.9 mbsf), we retrieved Core s 360-U1473A-57R through 89R (519.2–789.2) and recovered 241. 4 m $\left(89\%\right)$ using four RCB coring bits. Coring conditions were ideal for the most part in these less deformed gabbroic rocks. We arguably recovered the single longest piece of igneous rock ever $(2.85\;\mathrm{m})$ in Core 84R. On 18 January the drill string got stuck in the hole an d it took $15\,\mathrm{h}$ to get back into coring operations. Nevertheless, as wit h the first coring episode, extrapolating the average daily advanc e during this episode (including stuck time) over the total number o f coring days available, we would have reached $>\!1200$ mbsf.  

# Successful logging and mechanical bit release problem (23–30 January 2016)  

We conducted successful wireline logging runs with (1) the “triple combo” tool string, (2) the FMS-sonic tool string, and (3) th e Ultrasonic Borehole Imager (UBI). When the drill string was recovered, the mechanical bit release (MBR) top connector was missin g the sleeve retainer ring, which was presumed to have fallen into th e bottom of the hole. We first used a fishing magnet trying to recove r the ring without success. Next we deployed a coring bit in the hop e that the missing part may have dropped onto the seafloor when th e previous RCB bit was released prior to logging; however, we immediately experienced excessive torque that was attributed to contac t with metal at the bottom of the hole. The presence of the sleeve retainer ring at the bottom of Hole U1473A was confirmed with  a subsequent RCJB deployment, which recovered three rounde d boulders with tool marks that fit the sleeve retainer perfectly. At thi s point in time we had to leave Site U1473 and get underway for Mauritius.  

# Port call and transit to Site U1473 (30 November–16 December)  

Expedition 360 (SWIR lower crust and Moho) began with th e first line ashore at the Unity Container Terminal Berth in Colombo, Sri Lanka, at $1100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 November $\mathrm{(UTC+5.5\,h)}$ ). The Co-Chie f Scientists, IODP technical staff, and the Expedition Project Manager boarded the ship. The remainder of the science party and th e ship’s crew boarded the vessel on the second day of the port call ( 1 December).  

Port call activities took place from 30 November through 5 December and included routine offloading of cores and miscellaneou s freight from Expedition 359 and loading of miscellaneous drillin g equipment, expedition stores, and food for Expedition 360. Activities also included offloading $5\%$ inch and 5 inch drill pipe for inspection and refurbishment, loading 295 joints of new 5 inch dril l pipe, and pumping 900 metric tons of marine gas oil from barges t o the ship’s fuel tanks. On 4 December, the port authority require d the ship to move from the Unity Container Terminal berth to th e JCT Transfer Jetty to complete port call operations, includin g pumping of 60 metric tons of barite and 54 metric tons of sepiolit e from trucks into the ship’s bulk tanks. Loading of all supplies wa s concluded at $1800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 December and the last line was released a t $2018\,\mathrm{h}$ , getting the ship under way to the Atlantis Bank at full spee d of $11.2\,\mathrm{kt}$ .  

During the transit, ship time was changed by $-0.5\mathrm{~h~}$ on 6 December and by $-1.0\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 December, resulting in $\mathrm{UTC}+4\,\mathrm{h}$ , whic h was the time zone for the remainder of Expedition 360. Plans for th e reentry installation were finalized and all reentry hardware was located and inspected. Ship tours were given to the science party. Th e hydraulic release tool (HRT) was assembled in preparation for running the drill-in casing system. Appropriate space-out drawing s were completed, defining the drill-in casing program. The dual elevator handler was overhauled and all other drilling and corin g equipment had the prespud maintenance checks completed.  

On 13 December the ship’s speed was reduced and the cours e changed to maneuver around the center of tropical depression ExBohale. On 16 December we arrived at the coordinates for propose d primary Site AtBk6 $32^{\circ}42.3402^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $57^{\circ}16.6910^{\prime}\mathrm{E})$ ), and at $1700~\mathrm{h}$ w e switched to dynamic positioning mode. The $2817~\mathrm{nmi}$ sea voyag e was completed in 10.9 days at an average speed of $10.7\,\mathrm{kt}$ .  

# Seafloor survey and installing the reentry system (17–19 December)  

On 17 December, an APC/XCB bit, bit sub, drill collars, and ne w 5 inch drill pipe were made up and lowered to 668 mbrf (bottomhole assembly [BHA] Run 1). The subsea camera system was installed and lowered to just above the bit in preparation for a surve y to select a site appropriate for drilling at or near proposed Sit e AtBk6. The survey strategy was to proceed in a square spiral pattern, increasing at $_{10\mathrm{~m~}}$ intervals away from the start point (Sit e AtBk6) until a sufficiently flat bare-rock spot at least $5\;\mathrm{m}$ in diameter was located. During the survey, the drill pipe and camera wer e raised and lowered by up to several meters as required by the seafloor morphology. No suitable site was found during the initial $50\,\mathrm{m}$ $\times\,50\,\mathrm{m}$ survey. The survey was extended to the south by a further 5 0 m in the direction of the most promising seafloor. After a total of 5. 5 h of survey a suitable location for Hole U1473A was found a t $32^{\circ}42.3622^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $057^{\circ}16.6880^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ $710.2\,\mathrm{mbsl}_{\cdot}$ ), $40\,\mathrm{m}$ south of the origina l start point. Total survey operations lasted from 0530 to $1530\,\mathrm{h}.$ . After recovery of the camera system and drill pipe, an acoustic beaco n was dropped to provide additional positioning information into th e dynamic positioning system.  

Later on 17 December we began to assemble the drill-in casin g reentry system, consisting of a $12\%$ inch tricone bit, bit sub, underreamer, and mud motor. A pump-in sub was installed on top of th e mud motor and connected with a high-pressure hose to the mu d manifold to verify the proper functioning of the mud motor and underreamer. The mud motor began turning at 15–20 strokes/min, and the retractable arms on the underreamer opened at 4 0 strokes/min and 300 psi. The HRT running tool was attached to th e drilling assembly and this entire drilling stinger was racked back i n the derrick.  

One joint of $13\%$ inch casing was picked up and trimmed t o $11.35\mathrm{~m~}$ length. The previously assembled drilling stinger was inserted into the casing and the $13\%$ inch casing hanger and the HR T were made up to the casing, with all casing connections stitchwelded. The assembly (BHA Run 2) was lowered to the moonpool and the hard rock landing skirt was welded underneath the casin g collar. The entire assembly was lowered to the seafloor and the subsea camera system was run to just above the casing hanger to observe the drill-in process. The top drive was picked up, and drillin g in Hole U1473A started at $0535\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 December. During the firs t hour, drilling was punctuated with erratic torque, which was onl y detectable by the camera system. Drilling smoothed noticeably afte r the underreamer was drilled into the seafloor. A bull’s eye level mounted on the landing skirt broke off and disappeared from vie w about $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ into the drill-in process.  

The signals from the two subsea cameras were lost at $1445\,\mathrm{h}$ an d the camera was pulled to the surface. A backup telemetry pod wa s installed and the cameras redeployed by $1700\,\mathrm{h}$ . Drilling continue d without the camera system except while handling the camera fram e at the surface. After a period of no advancement, at $1845\,\mathrm{~h~}$ w e stopped drilling out of concern that the underreamer and bit assembly may have had a problem. With the $16\%$ inch cased hole now extending to 11.5 mbsf, we circulated a mud sweep and starte d recovering the subsea camera system.  

The HRT free-fall funnel was assembled and dropped at $2015\,\mathrm{h}$ . We observed its successful landing on the $13\%$ inch casing hange r via the redeployed subsea camera system from 1915 to $2045~\mathrm{h}$ . Th e stinger with bit, mud motor, and underreamer was released fro m the casing by pumping a release piston down the pipe and into th e HRT. The casing dropped ${\sim}1.7\mathrm{~m~}$ to the bottom of the $16\%$ inc h hole. The camera system and the stinger with HRT, mud motor, underreamer, and bit were pulled clear of the reentry system by $2230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 December and tripped back to the surface.  

With the knowledge that the $13\%$ inch casing had landed on th e bottom of the $16\%$ inch hole, we decided that attempting to cemen t the casing would not be prudent. If we were unable to push cemen t into the annulus between the casing and the hole we might instea d end up cementing inside the casing and up to the funnel.  

# First coring episode (19–30 December)  

From 0500 to $1215\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 December, the RCB BHA was mad e up with a C-7 drill bit and lowered to 668 mbrf (BHA Run 3). Next, we deployed the subsea camera system and performed a short survey of the reentry system, which showed that the reentry installation was higher than our initial numbers indicated. Our curren t estimate has the seafloor at 721 mbrf $(710.2\,\mathrm{\mbsl})$ . The initial drilled depth is 730.5 mbrf (9.5 mbsf), with the casing shoe at 728. 4 mbrf (7.4 mbsf). The $12\%$ inch rathole was ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{m}$ deep and the top o f the cone is at ${\sim}714$ mbrf $(703.2\;\mathrm{mbsl})$ . The reentry installation appeared stable.  

We picked up the top drive and reentered Hole U1473A at 153 5 h on 19 December (first reentry). At $1745\mathrm{~h~}$ after recovering th e camera system and washing back to bottom ( $\left[\sim\!2\;\mathrm{m}\right.$ of fill), the cor e barrel was dropped and cutting of the first core (360-U1473A-2R ) began. Coring continued through Core 9R $(80.4~\mathrm{mbsf})$ , when drill bit use had reached $39.5\,\mathrm{h}$ at $1500\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 December. The hole wa s cleaned and the drill pipe was pulled to the surface, equipped with  a new C-7 RCB bit, and redeployed (BHA Run 4). Hole U1473A wa s reentered for the second time at $2335\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 December. No fill wa s recorded at the bottom of the hole. RCB coring resumed at $1315\;\mathrm{h}$ on 22 December from 80.4 mbsf. At $0400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 December, whe n coring had reached 167.7 mbsf (Core 18R) and bit rotating hour s was $42.5~\mathrm{h}$ , the drill string was again retrieved to install a new bit. We reentered Hole U1473A with the third RCB bit at $1137\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 4 December (BHA Run 5). No fill was detected on bottom and corin g resumed at $1415~\mathrm{h}$ from 167.7 mbsf. While cutting Core 19R, th e ship’s heave continued to increase. The situation worsened while attempting to cut Core 20R. When it became impossible to keep th e bit on bottom after a $2.7\,\mathrm{m}$ advance, we suspended coring. Core 19 R was recovered and the drill string tripped out of the hole and secured with the end of the pipe in the water column at $624~\mathrm{mbsl}$ while we waited on the swell to subside. Ship heave of over $6\,\mathrm{m}$ tota l amplitude was recorded while WOW.  

After a $1~\mathrm{{h}}$ period with heave consistently ${<}4\mathrm{~m~}$ , the ship wa s positioned to reenter Hole U1473A at $1122\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 25 December. Afte r reentering the hole and lowering the bit to the bottom, no fill wa s observed and RCB coring continued at $1400\,\mathrm{h}$ from 180.1 mbsf, recovering Cores 21R through 34R (313.2 mbsf), when rotation tim e on the third RCB coring bit reached $41.9~\mathrm{h}$ . The hole was cleane d and the drill string retrieved, with the bit clearing the rotary table a t $1755\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 December.  

The fourth C-7 RCB bit was made up to the BHA and the dril l string was redeployed and reentered Hole U1473A at $0008~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 8 December. When the drill string was lowered to the bottom of th e hole, $1.5~\mathrm{m}$ of soft fill was encountered, which was washed out an d followed by another mud sweep to remove the cuttings from th e hole. RCB coring resumed at 313.2 mbsf and continued throug h Core 44R at 410.2 mbsf. At the end of cutting Core 44R, a mu d sweep was pumped, which was followed by an increase in dril l string torque to $\mathord{\sim}700\,.$ A. The drill string was worked for ${\sim}3\,\mathrm{h}$ with  a combination of excessive pull (50,000 lb), rotation (800 A), and circulation. The drill string became free at $0100~\mathrm{h}$ on 30 December. Core 44R was retrieved and another core barrel was dropped. Whil e attempting to get back on bottom to continue coring, the driller experienced erratic torque, up to $450\mathrm{~A~}$ . After a few minutes of attempting to core, the decision was made to pull the drill string eve n though we had only 34.6 rotating hours on the bit. Upon clearin g the rotary table at $0740\;\mathrm{h},$ the bit was found to be missing three ou t of four roller cones.  

This first coring episode with four BHA runs and four RCB bit s recovered Cores 2R through 44R (9.5–410.2 mbsf) with $161.3\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered $(49\%)$ . Recovery was below expectations when compare d with Hole 735B. Hole conditions and lithologic evidence indicate d one or more major fault zones, including one at ${\sim}400$ mbsf.  

# Fishing for roller cones and medical evacuation (30 December–7 January 2016)  

A new BHA was assembled with a 9 inch Bowen fishing magne t to attempt to retrieve the cones left in the bottom of the hole. Hol e U1473A was reentered at $1244\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 December (BHA Run 7), an d the fishing magnet was lowered to the bottom of the hole with circulation and slight rotation, in accordance with the Bowen procedures. The drill string was tripped back to the surface and th e fishing magnet arrived at the rig floor at $2020~\mathrm{h}$ . The magnet ha d picked up some magnetic debris (core catcher parts); however, non e of the three roller cones was retrieved.  

During the trip out of the hole we were informed by the ship’ s physician of a medical emergency necessitating transfer of the patient to a medical facility for examination and treatment. At $2324\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 December, the ship started the transit toward Mauritius.  A helicopter was scheduled and the vessel sailed to a rendezvous poin t south of Mauritius. A recently formed tropical depression was between the vessel and the meeting point, necessitating a course deviation to the west to avoid the worst of the bad weather. The vessel arrived at the agreed on rendezvous point at $1634~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 Januar y and switched to dynamic positioning mode. The helicopter fro m the Mauritius Police Department touched down at $1717~\mathrm{h}$ and departed at $1725\ \mathrm{h}$ with the patient on board. The ship started th e transit back to Site U1473 at $1742\,\mathrm{h}$ . It arrived at $1035~\mathrm{h}$ on 5 January, switching from cruise mode to dynamic positioning mode. Th e total transit distance covered for the medical evacuation was 132 0 nmi and it consumed 5.6 days of operational time allocated for Expedition 360.  

In preparation for our second attempt to retrieve the three rolle r cones left at the bottom of Hole U1473A, the BHA was made u p with new drill collars and a Bowen fishing magnet with a millin g guide and two boot-type junk baskets. Hole U1473A was reentere d at $2146\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 January (BHA Run 8; seventh reentry). The bit lande d on fill at 316.7 mbsf and was washed to the bottom of the hole wit h slight rotation. A 30 barrel mud sweep was pumped and the strin g was worked up and down three times and slowly turned five times. The drill string was retrieved and the fishing magnet arrived at th e rig floor at $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 January. The magnet picked up some metal debris from the lost core catcher but none of the missing cones fro m the main RCB coring bit.  

Next, we made up a Gotco RCJB with a milling guide and tw o boot-type junk baskets and reentered Hole U1473A at $1330\,\mathrm{h}$ (BH A Run 9; eighth reentry). The bit was rotated and washed to the bottom of the hole with slight rotation. After tagging the bottom of th e hole, a 20 barrel mud sweep was pumped to clean out the hole. Th e RCJB was worked up and down three times before the flow-deviating steel ball was dropped down the drill pipe to activate the revers e circulation. The driller attempted to advance the bit for $20\ \mathrm{min}$ using low weight (2000 lb) before the drill string was tripped back t o the surface, clearing the rig floor at $0110\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 January. The RCJ B assembly recovered gravel, including a few boulders, of gabbroi c and fault rock material but no signs of the missing roller cone parts.  

The same RCJB assembly was made up once more and reentere d in Hole U1473A at $0555\,\mathrm{h}$ (BHA Run 10; ninth reentry). With the bi t near the bottom of the hole, two 30 barrel high-viscosity mu d sweeps were pumped before the bit was worked up and down fro m 0845 to $1030~\mathrm{h}$ . Reverse circulation was activated and the drille r spent nearly $1\,\mathrm{~h~}$ advancing to ${\sim}410.8$ mbsf, using greater weigh t than during the previous run (2000–4000 lb; 200–400 A; 16 0 strokes/min). The drill string was recovered, clearing the rig floor a t $1510\,\mathrm{h}$ . To everyone’s surprise, the RCJB had recovered an unprecedented $0.5\;\mathrm{m}$ long, $18\,\mathrm{cm}$ diameter core from a cored interval of 0. 6 m $83\%$ recovery). The core was given the core type designatio n Core 45M. However, none of the roller cones previously lost in th e hole were recovered.  

Given the tight fit of the RCJB assembly in the hole, it was extremely unlikely that any roller cone bits could have remained at th e bottom of the hole. We speculated that the cones may have bee n lifted out of the hole with one or more of the previous three run s with two fishing magnets and the RCJB (Run 07-FM, Run 08-FMM, Run 09-RCJB) and dropped on the seafloor before they could reac h the rig floor, or they could be lodged in the borehole sidewall wher e breakouts created cavities. On 7 January, we decided to resume RC B coring.  

# Second coring episode and two roller cones lost and found (7–12 January)  

A BHA was assembled with a new RCB C-7 bit and reentere d Hole U1473A for the tenth time (BHA Run 11) at $2320\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 January. A wash core barrel was deployed to facilitate the cleaning out o f debris before resumption of coring. The last meter of the hole ha d to be reamed because the RCJB had created a slightly undersize d hole. We pumped 50 barrels, then 30 barrels of high-viscosity mu d and retrieved the wash core barrel at $0515~\mathrm{h}$ . Another core barre l was dropped and Cores 46R through 52R (410.8–469.6 mbsf) wer e retrieved with a total recovery of $20.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(34\%)$ . Penetration rate s were high for several cores, with a maximum of $8.9~\mathrm{m/h}$ for Cor e 48R. In addition, recovery was low and cores were highly fractured, indicating a weak formation. Coring operations included five 3 0 barrel mud sweeps. Because of excessive torque (500 A) in the lowermost part of the hole, a wiper trip was conducted to condition th e hole and $^{1\,\mathrm{h}}$ was spent reaming the hole. After advancing throug h $1.5~\mathrm{m}$ of fill on the bottom of the hole, the bit was advanced $_{0.6\textrm{m}}$ for Core 52R, with erratic high torque. Given the large amount o f reaming that had been required and despite the low bit hours (12. 1 h), we decided to retrieve the drill string, which cleared the rig floo r at $1545~\mathrm{h}$ on 9 January 2016. We discovered that the RCB bit wa s missing one of its four roller cones.  

An RCJB with tandem boot junk baskets was assembled and deployed in an attempt to recover the missing cone. The bit reentere d Hole U1473A at $2007\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 January and was washed to the botto m of the hole at 469.6 mbsf with circulation and slight rotation.  

The RCJB (BHA Run 12) was deployed and worked up an d down near the bottom of the hole. After activating reverse circulation by dropping the steel ball down the hole and working som e more on the bottom, the drill string was recovered. It cleared the ri g floor at $0500\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 January, recovering some gravel but no rolle r cone.  

The RCJB was reassembled with a new mill tooth cutting sho e and catcher assembly and deployed once more (BHA Run 13), reentering Hole U1473A at $0846\mathrm{~h}$ . After a 30 barrel mud sweep, th e RCJB was worked and activated again according to protocol. Th e drill string was retrieved, clearing the rig floor at $1605\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 January. This time the recovery consisted of a large cobble and the los t roller cone.  

We decided to resume coring and made up an RCB BHA with  a new RCB C-7 bit, lowered it to the seafloor, and reentered Hol e U1473A at $2037\,\mathrm{~h~}$ (BHA Run 14; sixth RCB run). The bit wa s washed to the bottom of the hole, which included a 50 barrel mu d sweep after noting $_{0.5\textrm{m}}$ of fill at the bottom. Our attempt to cu t Core 53R $\mathrm{(469.6{-}470.6~m b s f)}$ from 0015 to $0400~\mathrm{h}$ on 11 Januar y advanced only $1\,\mathrm{m}$ and achieved no recovery. Erratic torque was observed during this advance and repeated mud sweeps were pumped. Then we cut Core 54R (470.6–480.3 mbsf), advancing the full $9.7\;\mathrm{m}$ but not recovering any core. Based on the assumption that rock ha d jammed the bit throat, we deployed a deplugger $(1045{-}1130\;\mathrm{h})$ ) i n an attempt to dislodge the obstacle. This was followed with anothe r failed attempt to core (55R; 480.3–481.7 mbsf; $1.4~\mathrm{m}$ advance, n o recovery). We ran another bit deplugger and dropped another cor e barrel; however, no penetration could be achieved. At $1745\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 1 January, we decided to recover the drill string and the bit cleared th e rig floor at $2150~\mathrm{h}.$ . Upon inspection, the bit had lost most of th e tungsten carbide inserts, particularly toward the inside of the rolle r cones, and was missing one of the four core guides.  

The bit had obviously encountered metal at the bottom of th e hole, at a minimum its own missing core guide, and possibly one o f the missing cones lost in the hole a few days ago. At $2215~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 1 January, we began to make up and deploy a fishing magnet with mill tooth guide (FMM) and two boot-type junk baskets in an attempt t o recover the metal junk at the bottom of Hole U1473A (Run 15- FMM). We reentered Hole U1473A at $0321\mathrm{~h~}$ on 12 January an d tagged the bottom of the hole at $0615~\mathrm{h}$ without encountering an y fill. Two 30 barrel mud sweeps were pumped while working th e magnet and its milling shoe according to protocol. The drill strin g was retrieved, clearing the rig floor at $1105\,\mathrm{h},$ and we found that th e fishing magnet had successfully recovered a heavily eroded rolle r cone. As we suspected from inspection of the bit from Run 14, th e cone had plugged the RCB bit and prevented advancement and recovery of core the previous day. Some gravel was recovered as well in the boot-type junk baskets.  

# Drilling ahead (12–13 January)  

We decided to drill ahead without coring for an interval not t o exceed $100\mathrm{~m~}$ using a tricone bit. The tricone drilling bit is mor e robust than the RCB coring bit and therefore more suitable to mitigate potential issues near the bottom of the hole, such as reaming  a slightly tight hole. We also wanted to get an idea of how much faste r drilling would deepen the hole compared to coring, and we wante d to do that before reaching the modeled depth interval $\mathord{\sim}600$ mbsf o r deeper) where we expect to penetrate the magnetic polarity transition from reversed to normal.  

We started to make up a $9\%$ inch tricone bit at $1200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 12 January, reentered Hole U1473A at $1545\,\mathrm{h},$ washed and reamed down  a tight hole to the bottom at $481.7~\mathrm{mbsf},$ began to drill new hole a t $2300\ \mathrm{h},$ and deepened the drilled interval to 519.2 mbsf. Drillin g conditions were reasonably good; however, the rate of advanc e barely matched the rates we had achieved with RCB coring earlier i n the hole. We decided in the afternoon of 13 January to switch bac k to coring. The drill string was retrieved and cleared the rig floor a t $2010\,\mathrm{h}$ . Inspection of the tricone drill bit showed slight wear of th e outside diameter caused by the narrow gauge hole, but the cone s and bearings were all in good condition. The wear was sever e enough to crack all 4 tungsten carbide bit nozzles.  

# Third coring episode (13–23 January)  

A new $9\%$ inch RCB C-7 bit was made up and deployed to nea r the seafloor (BHA Run 17; seventh RCB bit), at which point deployment was suspended to allow the rig crew to slip and cut 115 ft o f drilling line as part of their routine rig maintenance. Hole U1473 A was reentered at $0210\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 January, reamed down from 510.6 t o $519.2\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ and cleaned with a 30 barrel high-viscosity mud sweep. When the intended wash barrel was recovered at $0730\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , it surprisingly contained a $0.2\;\mathrm{m}$ long freshly trimmed core plus $0.2\;\mathrm{m}$ of additional material, which was registered as Core 57R (519.2–519. 6 mbsf). We subsequently recovered Cores 58R through 66R $\left(519.6-\right.$ $606.6~\mathrm{mbsf})$ and recovered $64.9\mathrm{~m~}$ $(75\%)$ . Coring conditions wer e optimal during this run. Average torque on bottom remained ${\sim}350$ A and recovery was getting better downhole. Thirty barrel high-viscosity mud sweeps were pumped every $5\,\mathrm{m}$ .  

With $39.6~\mathrm{h}$ on the bit, we decided at $0700~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 January t o retrieve the drill string for another bit change, clearing the rig floo r at $1055\,\mathrm{h}$ . Upon inspection, the RCB coring bit was intact, with ver y little wear on the skirt or its tungsten carbide inserts. The inserts o n the nose of the bit showed appreciable signs of wear but were intact.  

A new $9\%$ inch C-7 bit was made up and, following some rig servicing tasks, reentered Hole U1473A at $1424~\mathrm{h}$ (BHA Run 18; eight h RCB bit). Coring resumed at $1830~\mathrm{h}$ and continued through Cor e 71R $(648.4~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ), with 30 barrel mud sweeps pumped as required. At $2215\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 January, we had to suspend coring and pull out o f the hole because of high ship heave. Given the time spent on the bi t already, we decided to use the down time for an early bit change an d retrieved the drill string with the bit clearing the rig floor at $0240\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 January. Run 18 (Cores 67R through 71R) recovered $41.3\;\mathrm{m}$ ( a staggering $99\%$ ).  

A new RCB C-7 drill bit was installed and lowered toward th e seafloor (BHA Run 19; ninth RCB bit). By that time, the swell ha d subsided and we reentered Hole U1473A at $0653~\mathrm{h}$ (the eighteent h reentry). RCB coring resumed at $1030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 January and Core 72 R was advanced from 648.4 to 651.9 mbsf with varying torque an d mud sweeps every few meters. At $1215\ \mathrm{h},$ , the drill pipe becam e stuck with the bit at 651.9 mbsf, with loss of rotation despite applying torque up to $800\mathrm{~A~}$ and overpull up to $175,000~\mathrm{lb}$ . The drille r gradually increased the pressure and overpull on the drill string, opening and closing the heave compensator in the process, and wa s able to work the bit up to 648 mbsf. The pipe suddenly became fre e at $1400~\mathrm{h}$ and rotation and circulation were reestablished. As w e pulled up to $555~\mathrm{mbsf},$ the torque gradually normalized and we retrieved Core 72R (648.4–651.9 mbsf) at $1615\,\mathrm{h}$ . We think that a significant piece of rock fell from higher up in the hole onto th e tapered drill collar and the drill string became free when the roc k was gradually broken up. The sudden release of energy when freein g the pipe was cause for concern. It was therefore decided to retriev e and inspect the BHA and the drill bit to minimize the overall risk t o the hole. Before pulling the drill string, the major traveling equipment on the rig was inspected for any visible damage. While pullin g the drill string with the top drive, the torque was carefully monitored; everything appeared normal. The bit arrived back on the ri g floor at $2015\,\mathrm{h}$ and was inspected. With $^{<2\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ of coring time, the bi t looked as good as new and was reassembled to the BHA.  

Hole U1473A was reentered at $2350\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 January (BHA Ru n 20; nineteenth reentry) and the bit was lowered to the bottom of th e hole without encountering any fill. Coring resumed and Run 20 retrieved Cores 73R through 81R (651.9–721.3 mbsf), recovering 65. 6 m $(95\%)$ . We pumped 30 barrel high-viscosity mud sweeps every  5 m to keep the hole clean. At $0200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 January, drill bit rotatin g time had reached $40\,\mathrm{{h}}$ and it was time for a pipe trip to replace th e bit. The drill string was retrieved and the bit arrived back on the ri g floor at $0635\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 January.  

We made up another RCB C-7 coring bit, this time with an MB R to allow us to drop the bit on the seafloor after coring, reenter th e hole, and conduct wireline logging without the need for a full pip e trip. The bit was lowered to the seafloor and Hole U1473A was reentered for the twentieth time at $1038\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 21 January. The bi t reached the bottom of the hole without drag or excessive torqu e and, after a 30 barrel mud sweep, coring resumed at $1515\,\mathrm{h}$ . We retrieved Cores 82R through 89R (721.3–789.2 mbsf) and recovere d $66.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ (a whopping $97\%$ ), pumping 30 barrel high-viscosity mu d sweeps every $5\,\mathrm{m}$ and a 50 barrel mud sweep at the end.  

# Successful logging and MBR problem  

At $1445\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 January, we began our wireline logging progra m for Hole U1473A, which had a total depth of 789.2 mbsf. With th e bit near the bottom of the hole, we displaced the hole with 290 barrels of drill water (freshwater) to enhance the salinity (and thus th e electrical resistivity) contrast between a relatively small amount o f formation pore fluid and a relatively large amount of borehole fluid. We raised the drill bit to 205 mbsf and displaced the upper part o f the hole with another 49 barrels of drill water. Next, we pulled th e bit out of the hole, clearing the seafloor at $1830\,\mathrm{h},$ , and offset the shi p $30\;\mathrm{m}$ east with the bit ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ above the seafloor. Using two wirelin e runs with the rotary shifting tool (RST), we dropped the drill bi t onto the seafloor at $1930\,\mathrm{h}$ . Next, we repositioned the ship and reentered Hole U1473A at $2145~\mathrm{h}$ on 23 January (twenty-first reentry), lowering the end of the pipe to 45.5 mbsf. The subsea camer a system was recovered and the rig floor prepared for logging.  

At $2330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 January, we began to rig up the logging tools fo r the first of three logging runs with the triple combo tool string, which measures bulk density, bulk resistivity, spectral NGR, magnetic susceptibility, total gamma radiation, and temperature. Th e triple combo was deployed at $0045\mathrm{~h~}$ on 24 January. The run included a $150\;\mathrm{m}$ upward calibration pass from the bottom of the hol e and the main upward logging pass from 787.8 mbsf. During th e main log, the tool string temporarily lost power at 354.0 mbsf an d was dropped back down to 383.1 mbsf before the log was completed. The tool string was back at the surface at $0530\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

The second run with the FMS-sonic tool string, which measure s microresistivity to generate a partial borehole wall image, propagation of compressional and shear waves, total gamma radiation, an d temperature, was deployed at $0815~\mathrm{h}$ . After the tool string was ru n to bottom at $785.5~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , the controller of the heave compensato r had to be rebooted to correct a problem. The run included thre e logging passes. The first was from 785.5 mbsf to just below the en d of pipe at 88.9 mbsf. The second pass was from 785.5 to 568.2 mbsf; it was aborted because one of the FMS arms didn’t open and th e tool was dropped back to the bottom. The third pass was from 785. 5 mbsf to the seafloor. The tool string was back at the surface at 153 0 h and rigged down by $1645\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 January.  

The third run with the UBI tool string, which generates a borehole wall image using ultrasound. The tool string was also configured to measured spectral gamma radiation as well as total gamm a radiation and temperature. It was deployed at $1800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 January. A downhole pass was measured from just above the seafloor t o 785.2 mbsf. The uplog started at 778.6 mbsf. A small problem wa s encountered with an apparent ledge at ${\sim}579$ mbsf in both directions. The tool string was back on the rig floor at $0330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 January.  

After all logging equipment was rigged down, the drill strin g was retrieved and cleared the rig floor at $0555\,\mathrm{h}$ . Upon inspection o f the MBR top connector, we found that the sleeve retainer ring wa s missing. The locking bolt securing the sleeve retainer was found t o be sheared. The most likely situation was that the sleeve retaine r backed out during logging operations and fell into the open hole. We therefore needed to retrieve it before we could resume coring. We made up and deployed a fishing magnet with mill guide, reentered Hole U1473A at $1012\,\mathrm{h}$ , and reached the bottom of the hole a t 789.2 mbsf. A significant amount of fill and hard material was encountered on the way to bottom. A 30 barrel mud sweep wa s pumped, and the fishing magnet was worked up and down near th e bottom of the hole according to protocol $(1430{-}1530\;\mathrm{h})$ ). The drill string was retrieved and cleared the rig floor at $1850~\mathrm{h}$ . The sleev e retainer ring was not recovered.  

Because a small possibility existed that the retainer dropped t o the seafloor when the bit was dropped, rather than into the hole, w e decided to attempt a coring run. An RCB bit was made up and deployed, reentering Hole U1473A at $2229\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 January. The drill string was washed and reamed to the bottom of the hole at 789. 2 mbsf, which included a 30 barrel high-viscosity mud sweep and th e deployment and recovery of a wash barrel. Next, a core barrel wa s dropped at $0315~\mathrm{h}$ on 26 January and an attempt was made at coring. Applying a maximum of 2000–3000 lb of weight and $350~\mathrm{A}$ o f torque, the driller noted erratic torque on bottom. After severa l careful attempts at coring, it became clear that metal junk was preventing advancement. The drill string was retrieved, clearing the ri g floor at $1020~\mathrm{h}$ . Upon inspection, the drill bit showed only a fe w scratches but was otherwise in excellent condition.  

The RCJB was made up with a mill tooth cutting shoe and tw o boot-type junk baskets and deployed in an attempt to retrieve th e missing MBR sleeve retainer ring (BHA Run 24). The bit reentere d Hole U1473A at $1420\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 January. At $1745\,\mathrm{h}$ when the top driv e was picked up to lower the pipe to the bottom of the hole, power t o the top drive was lost for $5.73\,\mathrm{h}$ . The circulation head was installe d so we could keep circulating and rising/lowering the drill strin g while the top drive electrical problem was being repaired. At $2300\,\mathrm{h},$ the top drive was picked up again and the drill string was washe d toward the bottom of the hole to complete the fishing attempt. A 3 0 barrel mud sweep was pumped, and the string was worked up an d down three times before the activation ball was dropped down th e pipe to trigger reverse circulation. After circulating and rotating o n bottom for $80\ \mathrm{min}$ , the top drive was set back and the drill strin g was retrieved, clearing the rig floor at $0545\mathrm{~h~}$ on 27 January. Th e sleeve retainer was not recovered; however, its presence at the bottom of Hole U1473 was confirmed with the recovery of thre e rounded cobbles that have clear tool marks characteristic of contac t with the sleeve retainer.  

With no expedition time left, the remaining drill collars wer e laid out to the drill collar racks and the rig floor was cleaned up an d secured for transit. At $0440\ \mathrm{h},$ the single acoustic positioning beacon was recovered. The thrusters and hydrophones were the n raised.  

A total of 86 RCB cores were taken over a $741.6~\mathrm{m}$ interval wit h a total recovery of $468.15\mathrm{~m~}$ of core. The reverse circulating jun k basket recovered a surprise core on one run and other samples on  a subsequent run. The total advance for the tool was recorded at 1. 1 m with a $1.0\,\mathrm{m}$ of material recovered. There were a number of othe r junk baskets recovered with sample material. With the exception o f the last junk basket runs, these were curated and entered into th e database against the hole. On the next to last junk basket run, th e material was recorded as a ghost core and entered into the databas e against from 9.5 to 788.2 mbsf. The final RCJB was recorded as a n advance of $_{0.5\textrm{m}}$ with $0.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of material recovered. The overall cor e recovery for Hole U1473A was $468.65\,\mathrm{m}$ over an interval of $742.2\:\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , yielding a recovery percentage for Hole U1473A of $63.2\%$ . The ghos t core was not considered in recovery statistics. The total time spen t on Hole U1473A was $868.5\,\mathrm{h}$ or 36.19 days.  

# Transit to Port Louis, Mauritius  

At $0830\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 January, the transit to Port Louis, Mauritius, began. Expedition 360 ended at $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 January with the first lin e ashore.  

# Education and outreach  

Expedition 360 had a team of four Education and Outreach officers on board the ship, including two teachers from France and th e USA, one informal educator and podcaster from Canada, and on e journalist from China. These officers communicated the goals o f the expedition in simple terms to students and the general publi c across the globe through live webcasts from the ship, online social media, and facilitating interviews between reporters from national and international media outlets and the science party. The officer s also developed curriculum and other educational material for students at all age levels.  

# Webcasts  

Using a direct satellite link, iPads, and videoconferencing software, the Education and Outreach team was able to interact wit h students all over the world to share the scientific goals and progres s of the expedition. This format allowed for direct communicatio n between students on shore and scientists aboard the JOIDES Resolution. A typical session included a brief demonstration of crust– mantle/Moho models comparing mid-ocean ridges of variou s spreading rates using samples and diagrams, followed by a laboratory tour that traced the path of a core on board the ship. Event s concluded with a question and answer portion that typically included a member of the science party.  

Events were organized to school classrooms with students age d 6–19 (with a mean age of 14), teacher workshops, and universities a t both the undergraduate and graduate level. A total of 120 event s reached 5947 people in 16 countries with 174 shipboard scientis t engagements. Demand for these events was overwhelming, and th e schedule filled up by mid-January. Teachers were given the optio n to combine classes within a school or overlap multiple participant s of the same language and age level from different locations. A number of these sessions were recorded by teachers for future use an d online publication (Table T3).  

# Social media  

The Education and Outreach Team maintained four websites fo r the duration of the expedition: a Facebook page, a Twitter feed, a n Instagram account, and a blog at http://joidesresolution.org. Eac h team member took turns contributing to these sites for a combine d total of 274 posts, which were viewed 350,065 times and replied to, liked, or shared 15,959 times (Table T4). The team also hosted a n “Ask Me Anything” session on Reddit, answering 64 questions fro m the public over the course of $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ with the help of 6 members of th e science party.  

# Media  

Expedition 360 received a significant amount of global media attention. The Education and Outreach Team supported intereste d journalists by arranging interviews with scientists on board an d providing background information, photographs, and video footage. This resulted in a total of 34 written articles in 7 languages,  4 English language radio interviews, and 3 English television broadcasts. Selected highlights from this coverage may be viewed in Tabl e T5, and a complete list of coverage during the expedition is in Tabl e T6.  

In addition, the presence of a Chinese reporter on board generated significant coverage in China. The Xinhua News Agency released about 30 news reports and more than 120 photograph s regarding Expedition 360. These reports have been transmitted b y many other media outlets and websites in China, which has arouse d widespread social interest. In China’s largest search engine Baidu, with the keywords “Zhang Jiansong” (the onboard reporter) an d “resolution,” more than 24,300 search results were returned. Furthermore, after having read these reports, some Chinese journalist s performed further interviews with IODP scientists. A video repor t was also filed to the Sansha TV station in the Hainan Province, nea r the South China Sea.  

# Educational material  

The Educators developed Expedition 360 specific curriculu m for students and educational material for the general public. Thi s material ranged from classroom activities to digital media, all o f which will be published and freely accessible at http://joidesresolution.org. In addition, a video version of the ship tour has bee n produced and is available to share with educators who were unabl e to participate in live broadcasts during the expedition. In coordination with one of the Co-Chief Scientists, aspects of this video wer e designed to specifically tie in with a number of key ideas within U K GCSE, AS and A-level national curricula for Geology and Geography.  

Prior to the expedition, the Educators made presentations to elementary and secondary schools, sharing their upcoming experience with ${\sim}800$ teachers and students. One school district in Texa s produced a promotional video outlining Expedition 360; this vide o also encouraged teachers and students throughout the district t o participate in the activities planned for the expedition.  

In order to prepare classes for webcasts with the ship, images o f samples were collected to create in-classroom activities. These images can be used to observe the interaction between seawater an d lower crustal rocks in a tectonically active region. These activitie s aim to help students understand the continuous evolution of plat e tectonic theory and the links between the lithosphere and biosphere. Fifteen activities correlated with Texas standards and teaching resources covering four topics that fit with French standard s were created during the expedition.  

Six $20\;\mathrm{min}$ podcast episodes featuring explanations of scientifi c concepts and interviews with the science party were published wit h 1500 listeners across 18 countries. One more episode is currently i n production and will be posted shortly after the expedition.  

# Postexpedition projects  

All of the Education officers will continue to develop materia l and engage in outreach activities promoting Expedition 360 an d ocean exploration in general after the expedition. They intend t o present their work at the 2016 American Geophysical Union Fal l Meeting and at other conferences as well as the postcruise meeting. Continued efforts will promote IODP in China by encouragin g teachers to sign up for webcasts and sail aboard the JOIDES Resolution.  

Peripheral rock material (gravelly cuttings otherwise discarded ) was collected by the Education and Outreach Team and will b e shipped to the US Science Support office and made available to educators for demonstration and instructional use. Further curriculum material will be developed and shared with teachers at state, national, and international levels.  

Collaboration will continue with the science party by organizin g postexpedition webcasts to communicate the progression of the research progress with students. The science party will be updated regarding outreach opportunities they can become involved in. Vide o footage was collected and will be edited to communicate the idea s shared among the science party and progression of the atmospher e during the expedition. Audio interviews recorded during the expedition will be further edited to create radio stories for wider distribution and syndication.  

# Preliminary assessment  

Expedition 360 was the first drilling leg of the multiphase SloM o Project that aims ultimately to drill through the Moho at Atlanti s Bank on the ultraslow-spreading SWIR. The primary broad-scal e objective of Expedition 360 was to establish a pilot hole for ultradeep drilling, as deep as possible in the time available. At Sit e U1473, we were successful in achieving the deepest igneous roc k penetration from the seafloor ever during a single 2-month expedition with the JOIDES Resolution (789.7 mbsf). Hole U1473A is ope n and viable to be substantially deepened; moreover, we were achieving an unprecedented $96\%$ core recovery in the lowermost $200\;\mathrm{m}$ o f the hole by the end of the expedition.  

# Operations assessment  

We did not reach our precruise target depth of 1300 mbsf. Ou t of a 61 day expedition, projected to have 42.2 days on site, we ende d up with only 22.8 coring days. Had we had a full expedition withou t operational problems we would likely have had little trouble achieving or exceeding our original target depth. Substantial time (5. 5 days) was lost for a medical evacuation to Mauritius and half a da y to a late departure from port. Using Colombo as a starting port als o entailed an extraordinarily long transit, such that it was a full 1 7 days after the start of the expedition before we reached the stud y area. On two occasions we suffered bit failure resulting in rolle r cones being left in the hole, necessitating a total of 6.6 days of fishing to retrieve the cones. Toward the end of the leg, it was recommended that we use an MBR before logging, which had neve r produced any problems before, to save a pipe trip and conserve several extra hours for coring after the logging; however, a mechanical failure left a metal sleeve retainer at the bottom of the hole with insufficient time to fish the piece out of the hole. Two abbreviated attempts did not succeed, although they provided evidence that w e were very close. The piece is at the bottom of the hole, and the hol e is free of fill; hence, it should be routine to fish it out during a futur e visit. With this fishing and, ideally, minor remediation to cement  a fault zone in the upper portion of the hole, we can reoccupy Hol e U1473A and deepen it substantially. Drilling conditions at the bas e of the hole are excellent; noteworthy is the $96\%$ core recovery w e obtained in the lowermost $200\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Despite of all the issues described, in only 22 days we drilled th e deepest single hole ever initiated for a single hard rock leg in th e history of ocean drilling. We left an open hole that can be reoccupied and deepened with only minor remediation. An open har d rock hole, where drilling conditions have significantly improve d with depth, is quite unusual. An open $800\;\mathrm{m}$ hole promising to penetrate a magnetic reversal boundary within the next tens to a fe w hundreds of meters is worth reoccupying in and by itself, broade r SloMo objectives notwithstanding.  

# Achievement of scientific objectives  

As anticipated, we drilled a section of lower crustal gabbro similar to that exposed on the surface of the Atlantis Bank oceanic cor e complex and recovered in nearby Holes 735B and 1105A. We di d not expect to encounter mantle lithologies during the first leg of th e first phase of SloMo, nor did we. From the Hole U1473A cores an d full suite of downhole logs we will be able to fully address most o f our major expedition-specific scientific objectives.  

A major objective was to establish whether or not the stratigraphy encountered and processes documented in Hole 735B ar e representative of the enormous $400\,\mathrm{km}^{2}$ gabbro massif mapped ove r Atlantis Bank, and if they can be reasonably considered as representative. This seems to be the case on the basis of three holes drille d there, from which we are now able to assess the spatial and tempora l scales of variability of igneous lower crustal accretion for the firs t time. Equally important is the comparison between Atlantis Ban k (SWIR) and its counterpart the Atlantis Massif oceanic core complex on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the stratigraphy differs profoundly in several aspects. A major long-term objective of SloMo i s to establish a seismic laboratory, at which the properties of th e lower crust and upper mantle can be directly measured at seismically appropriate scales. We have shown that Atlantis Bank is  a (probably uniquely) suitable location for such an endeavor. This i n itself is a huge accomplishment.  

The one objective we did not meet in full, because of the limite d time available to us for coring during Expedition 360, was to cros s the magnetic polarity reversal boundary known to be present a t depth beneath Atlantis Bank. We did, however, find increasing evidence for opposite polarities in discrete late-stage features in th e lowermost cores, indicating that we were entering a zone of polarit y transition. Although this evidence in itself provides an importan t constraint on the mechanisms by which magnetic reversals are recorded in the lower ocean crust, the key interval lies tantalizingl y close beneath.  

# Site selection  

Site selection for deep drilling at Atlantis Bank was always goin g to be to some extent a lottery, in that drilling conditions at depth a t a new location were always going to be unknown in detail. The original James Clark Ross JR31 site survey, conducted using an ROV an d seabed rock corers, was perfectly sufficient to identify apparentl y suitable sites on the surface of the Atlantis Bank platform; however, it could not accurately predict the fact that a moderate-sized faul t zone existed at depth. Site AtBk6 was in fact carefully chosen t o avoid faults resolved by the bathymetric data available to us. In theory, a modern high-resolution near-bottom bathymetry surve y could map lineaments at the surface and predict their subsurfac e continuations; however, the degree of erosion of the platform summit and extent of carbonate deposition when Atlantis Bank was a t or near sea level have modified and partially obscured the kinds o f medium-scale tectonic features we encountered at depth.  

Although the average recovery for the entire hole was high $63\%$ of the cored interval) compared to most hard rock holes, it was disappointing compared to Holes 735B and U1309D, where it wa s $80\%{-}90\%$ throughout. This is a direct result of drilling into a faul t system that extended down to 469 mbsf. In the course of drillin g through this faulted and fractured zone we broke two bits and ha d to fish for cones several times in order to continue coring. Afte r drilling (without coring) an interval to 510 mbsf to ensure we wer e past the problematic interval, we finally encountered excellent drilling conditions. From there to the bottom of the hole we had stead y low torque, penetration rates of ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{m/h},$ and an average recovery o f $96\%$ from 577.5 mbsf onward. This included the arguably longes t single piece of igneous core ever recovered $\left(2.85\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ , consistent wit h long intervals of unfractured rocks.  

The original location proposed in the SloMo Project for ultradeep penetration was Site 735, where we had proven the condition s at depth to be excellent on the basis of the results in Hole 735B. IODP engineers recommended a short offset from Hole 735B, t o drill to $1500\,\mathrm{~m~}$ with a casing plan designed on the basis of th e known conditions in Hole 735B, and then to core ahead to th e crust/mantle boundary. Earlier versions of our SloMo proposal, over a period of almost $10\ \mathrm{y,}$ were based on this operational plan. However, the compromise of moving the site to another location o n Atlantis Bank, and hence also collecting information on lateral heterogeneity of the lower crust and drilling a magnetic anomaly transition, was compelling to many, including the review panels. It wa s not of course known that the excellent drilling conditions encountered at both Sites 735 and 1105 were not to be replicated everywhere on Atlantis Bank.  

# Recommendations for future SloMo legs Preamble  

In 1994 ODP convened the Offset Drilling Workshop at Texa s A&M University to discuss how to optimize strategies for drilling i n hostile hard rock oceanic basement environments. Their principal recommendations were: (1) we need to learn how to drill in difficul t places and (2) we need to learn how to find easy places to drill. I n essence, the latter simply meant “invest the time to find a good plac e to drill first, then go for it.” This echoes the ODP Drilling Superintendent’s recommendation at the end of Leg 176 to come back t o Site 735, offset a short distance from Hole 735B, drill to $1500\,\mathrm{~m~}$ without coring, log, install casing where appropriate (after logging), and drill ahead. This is how deep holes are done in industry: first  a test hole, then engineer for a deep hole on that basis.  

Our first recommendation is that we should not be diverte d from the overall long-term plan for SloMo, which has been thoroughly and formally endorsed by the scientific community: that w e continue to focus on the objective of drilling a $\scriptstyle{\frac{53}{3}}\,{\mathrm{km}}$ deep hole t o the crust/mantle boundary during Phase 1 of the program. Whethe r in Hole U1473A or a new hole at Site 735, nothing we encountere d during Expedition 360 (SloMo Leg 1) suggests this is not feasible.  

# Taking advantage of a prepaid underused drilling platform  

We propose to continue the SloMo Project in the short to medium term with an operational approach that takes full advantage o f the three existing pilot holes on the Atlantis Bank (Holes 735B, 1105A, and U1473A). Our suggested approach for the next step is t o take advantage of “tie-up” periods when the JOIDES Resolution i s otherwise idle to conduct hole engineering, during which time fe w or no scientists need to be on board. The cost to the program fo r pursuing a long-term drilling project with the large-scale scope o f SloMo, which most of all requires sustained periods of time on hole, would be minimal.  

In the short term, in mid-2016, we propose that use be made o f the 4 month period in which the JOIDES Resolution is tied up i n South Africa to remediate Hole U1473A, ensure it is ready to be reoccupied for further scientific operations, and core ahead if possibl e (any core thus obtained can be described on shore). Once this i s done we will be in a position to make the strategic decision as t o whether Hole U1473A or Site 735 is the best location for drilling th e $3~\mathrm{km}$ hole to the crust/mantle boundary and completing SloM o Phase I.  

In the slightly longer term we suggest that, instead of tying u p the JOIDES Resolution, consideration be given to diverting the shi p to conduct further engineering/coring operations at Atlantis Ban k instead. These we propose could potentially include casing a hol e that would be deepened (without coring) to the 1500 mbsf depth o f the base of Hole 735B, from which point scientific coring expeditions could resume.  

# Specific proposals for next operational phase  

The program should consider (at least) the following options below.  

# Scheduling a short-term ancillary program in Hole U1473A  

The program should schedule an ancillary program in Hol e U1473A during the upcoming long transit back to Colombo and/o r the next best opportunity depending on weather and time availabl e and carry out the following operations:  

• Fish the junk in the hole.   
• Enter the hole with a tricone bit and cement each of the three problem intervals sequentially, let the cement cure, and drill out the cement.   
• Resume coring as time allows, potentially bringing along a couple of scientists to direct splitting of the core and to conduct a preliminary description of the material recovered. The cores would be split, labeled, run through the multisensor loggers, and then sealed in D-tubes and stored for the scientists to describe during a subsequent expedition to the site or at a core repository. This would make up for the lost drilling time because of the medical emergency and long transit and would potentially bring drilling in Hole U1473A back on schedule.  

The upper $469\mathrm{~m~}$ of Hole U1473A is slightly problematical, i n that material from the fractured intervals could continue to fall ont o the drill collars and jam the pipe in hole, as happened on one occasion during Expedition 360. Enlargement of the hole in these fractured regions will continue as cuttings are pumped past them. Th e remedial cementing work proposed above is simple, routine, an d should solve this problem.  

# Consider engineering a new deep hole at Site 735  

Scientific ocean drilling has never previously drilled to a dept h of $3\,\mathrm{km}$ , and doing so would be a turning point for the program i n terms of both scientific accomplishment and a demonstration of it s potential. The latter is critical for public support of ocean drilling. Drilling to the crust/mantle boundary, exploring for a new planetary biosphere, and drilling to the Moho are all things that excite th e public interest as demonstrated by the enormous national and international publicity generated during Expedition 360 (and similarl y during the Expedition 335 “Project Mohole” drilling operations i n the Pacific Ocean), as documented elsewhere in this report. IOD P should drill for success. It needs to demonstrate its capability t o tackle large projects and carry them forward to success. This, mor e than anything else, is critical to the future of scientific ocean drilling.  

Given the importance and challenge of such an endeavor, th e program, together with scientific stakeholders of the SloMo Project, should thoroughly evaluate all alternatives for the location of the $^{23}$ km deep hole and eventual ultradeep Mohole, based on analysis o f pilot Holes 735B and U1473A. If this were to conclude that Site 73 5 is the best option, an engineering leg would be required to drill  a new hole to $1500\mathrm{~m~}$ as close to Hole 735B as possible before the n coring ahead. A casing plan would need to be made in advanc e based on the drilling conditions encountered in Hole 735B to ensur e the cleanest possible hole in the best condition for attempting $^{23}$ km deep drilling. Such an engineering leg would be a relatively lo w cost affair, as it would not require sailing a scientific party and coul d take advantage of the fact that most of the costs beyond the reentr y cone, casing and bits, and fuel are already carried by the program. I t would also have the advantage that nearby Hole U1473A would provide an ideal backup site with the as yet to be accomplished majo r scientific objective of drilling through a magnetic reversal. Thus, i t would minimize the risks involved in scheduling the forthcomin g SloMo scientific legs back to back, with consequent savings in transit time and fuel costs in using Mauritius as a port.

Figure F1. 3-D perspective view of the Atlantis II Transform, looking northnortheast. Data compiled from multibeam data collected during Conrad Cruise C2709, James Clark Ross Cruise JR31, Yokosuka and Kairei site surve y cruises, and several French multibeam expeditions, combined with satellit e gravity seafloor data and the Global Multi-Resolution Topography databas e (http://www.marine-geo.org/portals/gmrt/) (see also Mendel et al., 1997, 2003; Dick et al., 1999; Kinoshita et al., 2001; Matsumoto et al., 2002; Sauter e t al., 2004; Baines et al., 2007).

Figure F4. Velocity models for north–south seismic Line CAM101 over Atlantis Bank, together with principal drill sites (modified after Muller et al., 2000). Gree n line $=$ depth of Hole U1473A drilled during Expedition 360, orange line $=$ projected penetration during the remainder of SloMo Phase I, red line $=$ projecte d penetration during SloMo Phase II (riser drilling). Velocity contours are $0.4\;\mathsf{k m}/\mathsf{s}$ . Upper panel shows an undifferentiated Layer 3; lower panel shows a lowe r serpentinized mantle Layer 3 and an upper gabbroic Layer 3. The models fit the data equally well. Triangles mark ocean-bottom hydrophones. Hole U1473 A lies on the line, and Hole 735B is projected from a kilometer to the west. Moho gaps are due to ocean-bottom seismometer placement and are not real (R.S. White, pers. comm., 2000).

Figure F6. Running average $(20\,\mathsf{m})$ of lithologies, crystal-plastic deformation intensity, and whole-rock Mg# $([M\mathfrak{g}\times100]/[M\mathfrak{g}+\mathsf{F e}])$ for Holes 735B and U1309 D (Mid-Atlantic Ridge at $30^{\circ}\mathsf{N}$ ), modified from Dick et al. (2000), Blackman et al. (2011), and Expedition 304/305 Scientists (2006). Different symbols for points i n whole-rock Mg# diagram represent different lithologies based on modal mineralogy; definitions can be found in the Leg 118 and 176 Initial Reports volume s (Robinson, Von Herzen, et al., 1989; Dick, Natland, Miller, et al., 1999) and the Expedition 304/305 Proceedings volume (Blackman, Ildefonse, John, Ohara, Miller, MacLeod, and the Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006). These sections represent descriptions from two different scientific parties, and although both followe d American Geophysical Institute conventions on nomenclature, exact definitions for each lithology described may vary. Lithologic plots differ from those previously presented, as the lithologies from both holes were grouped in the same manner to facilitate comparison. Gray dotted lines at $\mathsf{M g}\#=80$ emphasiz e overall chemical differences between the sections. Primary melts emerging from the mantle would be in equilibrium with gabbroic cumulates and dunite s with an $\mathsf{M g}\#\geq90$ , largely missing from both sections.

Figure F9. Track map of the subsea camera system during Site AtBk6/U1473 survey. The initial $50\,\mathsf{m}\times50\,\mathsf{m}$ box was extended south and west when it was clea r that the seafloor at and around the original Site AtBk6 location (Waypoint 1) was dominated by sediment and scattered blocks of gabbro. Local bathymetr y was derived from pipe length measurements combined with estimate of distance of pipe off the bottom for each minute of the survey.
