# 1. Introduction  

This section provides an overview of operations, depth conventions, core handling, curatorial procedures, and analyses performed on the R/V JOIDES Resolution during the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) South Atlantic Transect (SAT) Expeditions 390C, 395E, 390, and 393. This information applies only to shipboard work described in the Expedition reports section of the SAT Proceedings of the International Ocean Discovery Program volume. Methods used by investigators for shore-based analyses of expedition samples and data will be described in separate individual postexpedition research publications.  

# 1.1. Site locations  

GPS coordinates (WGS84 datum) from preexpedition site surveys were used to position the vessel at SAT expedition sites. A Knudsen CHIRP 3260 subbottom profiler with SounderSuite software was used to monitor seafloor depth during the approach to each site and to confirm the seafloor depth once on site. Once the vessel was positioned at a site, the thrusters were lowered and the position maintained via dynamic positioning. Dynamic positioning control of the vessel used navigational input from the GPS weighted by the estimated positional accuracy (Figure F1); no beacons were deployed. The final hole position was the mean position calculated from the GPS data collected over a significant portion of the time during which the hole was occupied.  

# 1.2. Drilling and logging operations  

To successfully drill both soft and indurated sediments as well as crustal material of varying age and alteration, all four standard coring tools available on JOIDES Resolution were deployed during the SAT expeditions: the advanced piston corer (APC), half-length APC (HLAPC), extended core barrel (XCB), and rotary core barrel (RCB) systems. Operations took place in international waters in water depths of ${\sim}3000{-}5000\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

The APC and HLAPC systems cut soft-sediment cores with minimal coring disturbance relative to other IODP coring systems. After the APC/HLAPC core barrel is lowered through the drill pipe and lands above the bit, the drill pipe is hydraulically pressurized until the two shear pins that hold the inner barrel attached to the outer barrel fail. The inner barrel then advances into the formation and cuts the core (Figure F2). The driller can detect a successful cut, or “full stroke,” by observing the pressure gauge on the rig floor because the excess pressure accumulated prior to the stroke drops rapidly.  

APC refusal is conventionally defined in one of two ways: (1) the piston fails to achieve a complete stroke (as determined from the pump pressure and recovery reading) because the formation is too hard, or (2) excessive force $(>\!60,\!000\,\mathrm{lb})$ is required to pull the core barrel out of the formation. For APC cores that do not achieve a full stroke, the next core can be taken after advancing to a depth determined by the recovery of the previous core (advance by recovery) or to the depth of a full APC core (typically $9.5\:\mathrm{m}$ ). When a full stroke is not achieved, one or more additional attempts are typically made, and each time the bit is advanced by the length of the core recovered (note that for these cores, this results in a nominal recovery of $\mathord{\sim}100\%$ ). When a full or partial stroke is achieved but excessive force is not able to retrieve the barrel, the core barrel can be “drilled over,” meaning that after the inner core barrel is successfully shot into the formation, the drill bit is advanced to total depth to free the APC barrel.  

The standard APC system uses a $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel, whereas the HLAPC system uses a $4.7~\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel. In most instances, the HLAPC system is deployed after the standard APC system has repeated partial strokes and/or the core liners are damaged. During use of the HLAPC system, the same criteria are applied in terms of refusal as for the APC system. Use of the HLAPC system allowed for significantly greater APC sampling depths to be attained than would have otherwise been possible. For the SAT expeditions, the HLAPC system was only deployed as time allowed.  

The XCB system is a rotary system with a small cutting shoe that extends below the large rotary APC/XCB bit (Figure F3). The smaller bit can cut a semi-indurated core with less torque and fluid circulation than the main bit, potentially improving recovery. It is primarily used in sediment but can core short intervals of hard rock, such as sills, or for capturing the sediment/basement interface. The XCB system is used when the APC/HLAPC system has difficulty penetrating the formation and/or damages the core liner or core. The XCB system can also be used to either initiate holes where the seafloor is not suitable for APC coring or it can be interchanged with the APC/HLAPC system when dictated by changing formation conditions. The XCB system is used to advance the hole when HLAPC refusal occurs before the target depth is reached or when drilling conditions require it. The XCB cutting shoe typically extends ${\sim}30.5~\mathrm{cm}$ ahead of the main bit in soft sediments, but a spring allows it to retract into the main bit when hard formations are encountered. Shorter XCB cutting shoes can also be used. The SAT expeditions relied on polycrystallin e diamond compact (PDC) XCB cutting shoes, which improved recovery across the sediment/ basement interface.

Figure F1. IODP convention for naming sites, holes, cores, sections, and samples. Ship positioning while coring was primarily accomplished with GPS data.  

The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) used for APC and XCB coring is typically composed of an $11\%$ inch $({\sim}29.05\;\mathrm{cm})$ roller cone drill bit, a bit sub, a seal bore drill collar, a landing saver sub, a modified top sub, a modified head sub, $8\%$ inch control length drill collars, a tapered drill collar, tw o stands of $5\%$ inch transition drill pipe, and a crossover sub to the drill pipe that extends to th e surface (Figure F4).  

The RCB system is a rotary system designed to recover firm to hard sediments and basemen t rocks. The BHA, including the bit and outer core barrel, is rotated with the drill string while bearings allow the inner core barrel to remain stationary (Figure F5).  

A typical RCB BHA includes a $9\%$ inch drill bit, a bit sub, an outer core barrel, a modified top sub, a modified head sub, a variable number of $8\%$ inch control length drill collars, a tapered drill collar, two stands of $5\%$ inch drill pipe, and a crossover sub to the drill pipe that extends to the surface. Figure F4 depicts a typical BHA for each coring system.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used for all APC, HLAPC, and RCB coring. APC cores were oriented with the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool when coring conditions allowed. Formatio n temperature measurements were taken with the advanced piston corer temperature (APCT-3 ) tool (see In situ temperature measurements). Information on recovered cores, drilled intervals, downhole tool deployments, and related information are provided in the Operations, Paleomagnetism, and Downhole measurements sections of each site chapter.

# 1.3. IODP depth conventions  

The primary depth scales used are defined by the length of the drill string deployed (e.g., drillin g depth below rig floor [DRF] and drilling depth below seafloor [DSF]), the depth of core recovere d (e.g., core depth below seafloor [CSF] and core composite depth below seafloor [CCSF]), an d the length of logging wireline deployed (e.g., wireline log depth below rig floor [WRF] and wirelin e log depth below seafloor [WSF]) (see IODP Depth Scales Terminology for sediments a t http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines/142-iodp-depth-scales-terminology-april2011/file). In cases where multiple logging passes are made, wireline log depths are mapped t o one reference pass, creating the wireline log matched depth below seafloor (WMSF) scale. Al l units are expressed in meters. The relationship between scales is defined either by protocol, suc h as the rules for computation of CSF depth from DSF depth, or by user-defined correlations, suc h as core-to-log correlation. The distinction in nomenclature should keep the reader aware that  a nominal depth value in different depth scales usually does not refer to the exact same stratigraphi c interval.  

Depths of cored intervals are measured from the drill floor based on the length of drill pip e deployed beneath the rig floor (DRF scale). The depth of the cored interval is referenced to th e seafloor (DSF scale; Figure F1) by subtracting the seafloor depth of the hole (i.e., water depth ) from the DRF depth of the interval. Standard depths of cores in meters below seafloor (core dept h below seafloor, Method A [CSF-A], scale) are determined based on the assumption that (1) the to p depth of a recovered core corresponds to the top depth of its cored interval (on the DSF scale) an d (2) the recovered material is a continuous section even if sediment core segments are separated b y voids when recovered. Standard depths of samples and associated measurements (CSF-A scale ) are calculated by adding the offset of the sample or measurement from the top of its section an d the lengths of all higher sections in the core to the top depth of the core.

# 1.3.1. Sediment core depth scales  

If a core has ${<}100\%$ recovery, for curation purposes all cored material is assumed to originate fro m the top of the drilled interval as a continuous section. In addition, voids in the core are closed b y pushing core segments together, if possible, during core handling. Therefore, the true depth interval within the cored interval is unknown. This result should be considered a sampling uncertaint y in age-depth analysis or in correlation of core data with downhole logging data.  

When core recovery is ${>}100\%$ (the length of the recovered core exceeds that of the cored interval), the CSF depth of a sample or measurement taken from the bottom of a core will be deeper tha n that of a sample or measurement taken from the top of the subsequent core (i.e., the data associated with the two core intervals overlap on the CSF-A scale). This overlap can happen when a sof t to semisoft sediment core recovered from a few hundred meters below the seafloor expands upo n recovery (typically by a few percent to as much as $15\%$ ). In this case, the core depth below seafloor, Method B (CSF-B), scale can be employed, where the core is (digitally) linearly compressed to fi t within the cored interval. Where core recovery is ${<}100\%$ , CSF-A and CSF-B depth scales ar e exactly equivalent. A stratigraphic interval may not have the same nominal depth on the DSF an d CSF scales in the same hole.  

During Expedition 390/393, both CSF-A and CSF-B depth scales were used. The CSF-A scale i s the default depth scale. However, the CSF-B scale was used for some data sets (e.g., biostratigraphic depths because the core catcher micropaleontological sample should appear at the botto m of that cored interval rather than apparently expanded into the underlying core interval). Wher e the CSF-B scale was used, depths are labeled as such in the text, tables, and figures.

# 1.3.2. Basement core depth scales  

Two depth scales are used in basement sections, CSF-A and meters subbasement (msb). In th e basement chapter sections, meters below seafloor (mbsf) is used and is the same as the CSF- A depth scale. Meters subbasement is the depth below the sediment/basement interface; the interface depth for each hole is described in the Stratigraphic unit summary section of each site chapter. The curatorial process for hard rock (see Curatorial core procedures and sampling dept h calculations) results in depths (CSF-A/mbsf) that do not reflect true depths as a result of incomplete recovery, the assumption that all material comes from the top of the cored interval, an d subsequent spacing out of the recovered material to “bin” it, which adds “void” intervals.  

Additionally, an “expanded” depth scale was used for plotting some basement data so that dat a points did not overlap with each other on plots. For basement cores with ${<}100\%$ recovery, th e recovered length was linearly stretched to fit into the cored depth interval.  

# 1.4. Curatorial core procedures and sampling depth calculations  

Numbering of sites, holes, cores, and samples follows standard IODP procedures (Figure F1).  A full curatorial identifier for a sample consists of the following information: expedition, site, hole, core number, core type, section number, section half, piece number (for cores/sections o f igneous/metamorphic rocks only), and interval in centimeters measured from the top of the cor e section. For example, a sample identification of “390-U1556C-15H-2W, $\mathrm{46-48~cm^{\prime\prime}}$ indicates a  2 cm long sample taken from the interval between 46 and $48\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ below the top of Section 2 (workin g half) of Core 15 ( ${}^{\ast}\mathrm{H}^{\prime\prime}$ designates that this core was taken with the APC system) of Hole C at Sit e U1556 (Figure F1). The “U” preceding the site/hole number indicates the hole was drilled by th e US platform, JOIDES Resolution. The coring system used to obtain a core is designated in the sample identifiers as follows: $\mathrm{{H}}\,=\,\mathrm{{APC}}$ , $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{~F~}}\!=$ HLAPC, ${\mathrm{R}}\,=\,{\mathrm{RCB}}$ , and $\mathrm{\DeltaX=\DeltaXCB}$ . Integers are used t o denote the “core” type of drilled intervals (e.g., a drilled interval before Core 2R would be denote d by Core 11 [i.e., Core 1 and Type 1]).

# 1.5. Core handling and analysis  

# 1.5.1. Sediment  

When the core barrel reached the rig floor, the core catcher from the bottom of the core wa s removed and taken to the core receiving platform (“catwalk”), and a sample was extracted for paleontological (PAL) analysis. Next, the sediment core was extracted from the core barrel in its plasti c liner. The liner was carried from the rig floor to the core processing area on the catwalk outside th e core laboratory, where it was labeled and split into ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{m}$ sections. Blue (uphole direction) an d clear (downhole direction) liner caps were glued with acetone onto the cut liner sections. In hole s where oxygen measurements and Rhizon sampling for interstitial water (IW) occurred, liner cap s were not glued with acetone until after sampling and analyses were completed.  

Once the core was cut into sections, whole-round samples were taken for IW chemical analyses, a s microbiological samples, and as geotechnical samples. When a whole-round sample was removed, a yellow end cap was used at the bottom of the remaining core section to indicate it was taken. I n one hole at each site, syringe samples were taken for gas analyses according to the IODP hydrocarbon safety monitoring protocol.  

The core sections were placed in a core rack in the laboratory, core information was entered int o the database, and the sections were laser engraved. In holes where stratigraphic correlations wer e being made, sediment cores were run on the Special Task Multisensor Logger (STMSL) to measure magnetic susceptibility (MS) and gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density before equilibration to room temperature. Oxygen probe measurements and Rhizon pore water samples wer e typically taken before core sections reached equilibrium with laboratory temperature (after ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{h}$ ), apart from in Hole U1556C. Core sections were then run through the Whole-Round Multisenso r Logger (WRMSL) for $P.$ -wave velocity ( $P$ -wave logger [PWL]), MS, and GRA bulk density measurements (see Physical properties and downhole measurements). The core sections were als o run through the Natural Gamma Radiation Logger (NGRL), often prior to temperature equilibration because that does not affect the natural gamma radiation (NGR) data. Thermal conductivit y measurements were taken once per core when the material was suitable, typically with the puc k probe rather than the needle probe.  

Core sections were then split lengthwise from bottom to top into working and archive halves. Investigators should note that older material can be transported upward on the split face of eac h section during splitting.  

The working halves of each core section were then laid out on the sampling tables, and sample s were taken for moisture and density (MAD) and paleomagnetic (PMAG) analyses and for remaining shipboard geochemical analyses such as $\mathrm{X}$ -ray diffraction (XRD), carbonate (CARB), an d inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Samples were not collected when the lithology was a high-priority interval for expedition or postexpedition research, the core material was unsuitable, or the core was severely deformed. During the expedition, samples for personal postexpedition research were taken when they concerned ephemeral propertie s (e.g., IW samples that require acidification).  

The archive half of each core was scanned on the Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL) to provid e linescan images and then measured for point magnetic susceptibility (MSP) and reflectance spectroscopy and colorimetry (RSC) on the Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL). Labeled foa m pieces were used to denote removed whole-round intervals in the SHIL images. The archive halve s were then described visually and by means of smear slides for sedimentology. During Expeditio n 393, archive-half sections were imaged on the XMAN X-ray scanner. Finally, the magnetization o f archive halves and working-half discrete pieces was measured with the cryogenic magnetomete r and spinner magnetometer.  

When all steps were completed, cores were wrapped in plastic wrap, sealed in plastic tubes, an d transferred to cold storage space aboard the ship. At the end of the expedition, the working halve s of the cores were sent to the IODP Bremen Core Repository (Center for Marine Environmenta l Sciences [MARUM], Bremen, Germany), where samples for postexpedition research were taken i n January 2023. The archive halves of the cores were first sent to the IODP Gulf Coast Repositor y (Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas [USA]), where a subset was scanned for X-ray fluorescence (XRF), before being forwarded to the Bremen Core Repository for long-term storage. Sediment core flow is summarized in Figure F6.  

# 1.5.2. Igneous rock  

Igneous and indurated rock cores were extracted from the core barrel in its plastic liner. The line r was carried from the rig floor to the core processing area on the catwalk outside the core laboratory, where it was split into ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{m}$ sections. These sections were immediately carried into th e splitting room. Pieces were extracted from the core liner in the splitting room and subsequentl y put into split plastic liners in consecutive order while maintaining the original orientation o f pieces as much as possible. The pieces were then pushed to the bottom of the $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ liner sections, and the total rock length was measured. The length was entered into the database as “recovere d length” using the SampleMaster application. This number was used to calculate recovery. If a cor e catcher sample was present, it was taken to the core splitting room separately and added to th e bottom section of the recovered core.  

![](images/6c1cdd2988b3cccd25ef8efa992e069979f84cbea404196f7ce7f2fc99ed3c7a.jpg)  
Figure F6. Sediment core flow through JOIDES Resolution laboratories, Expedition 390/393. See text for difference s between expeditions for each laboratory. $\mathsf{P W C}=P\!\!\!$ -wave velocity measured by caliper.  

For microbiological sampling, the split liners were sprayed with $70\%$ ethanol and wiped dow n prior to shaking pieces out. Only the necessary scientists (petrologist and microbiologists o n shift), an assigned representative of the Sample Allocation Committee, and technicians were present in the core splitting room for microbiology sampling to minimize contamination. Those present wore face masks and nitrile gloves sprayed with $70\%$ ethanol and made sure to pull hair back. The selected microbiological sample was photographed in context with the rest of the core sections overhead, and the sample/section was then immediately transferred in a sterile and seale d sample bag to the microbiology laboratory for further processing (see Microbiology).  

Oriented pieces of core that could not have rotated around a horizontal axis during drilling wer e marked on the bottom with a blue- or red-colored wax pencil to preserve orientation. Adjacen t but broken pieces that could be fit together along fractures were curated as single pieces. Th e petrologists confirmed piece matches, marked a split line on each piece, and denoted the workin g half with the letter “W,” which defined how the pieces were to be cut into two equal halves. Th e aim was to preserve representative lithologic and mineralogical features in both archive and working halves while ensuring the availability of fresh glass and vein features in the working halves fo r sampling purposes. Where possible, cutting lines were drawn parallel to the dip direction of structural features to maximize the expression of dipping structures on the cut face of the core. A plastic spacer was secured with acetone to the split core liner between individual pieces o r reconstructed continuous groups of subpieces. These spacers can add artificial gaps and also represent substantial intervals of no recovery. The length of each section of core, including spacers, was entered into the database as “curated length,” which commonly differs by several centimeter s from the length measured on the core receiving platform. Ultimately, the curated depth of eac h piece in the database was recalculated based on the curated length. The curatorial process ca n result in overestimation or underestimation of the depth from which a piece was cored.  

Core pieces were imaged around the full $360^{\circ}$ circumference using the Deutsche Montan Technologie (DMT) scanner (see Physical properties and downhole measurements). When the cor e sections reached equilibrium with laboratory temperature (typically after $2\;\mathrm{h}$ ), the whole-roun d core sections were run through the WRMSL (GRA and MS only) and NGRL (see Physical properties and downhole measurements).  

Each piece of core was split with a diamond-impregnated saw into an archive half and a workin g half, with the positions of plastic spacers between pieces the same in both halves. Pieces wer e numbered sequentially from the top of each section, beginning with 1. Separate subpieces within  a single piece were assigned the same number but lettered consecutively (e.g., 1A, 1B, etc.). Label s were attached using epoxy only on the outer cylindrical surfaces of the core. If it was evident tha t an individual piece had not rotated around a horizontal axis during drilling, an arrow pointing t o the top of the section was added to the label. The oriented character of each piece was recorded i n the database using the SampleMaster application.  

The archive half of each core was scanned on the SHIL (with a dry surface during Expedition 39 0 and with both dry and wet surfaces during Expedition 393) and measured for MSP and RSC on th e SHMSL. Thermal conductivity measurements were made on selected archive-half pieces (se e Physical properties and downhole measurements). After the archive-half sections of each cor e were fully described by the petrologist and structural geologist on shift, samples were taken fro m the working-half sections for shipboard analyses (billets for thin sections, chips for ICP-AES, an d cube samples $[{\sim}8\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}]$ for paleomagnetism analyses, MAD, and discrete $P.$ -wave velocity measurements; see Igneous petrology, Alteration petrology, Geochemistry, Paleomagnetism, an d Physical properties and downhole measurements). The magnetizations of archive-half section s and pieces, as well as discrete cube samples taken from the working-half sections, were measure d with the cryogenic magnetometer and spinner magnetometer, respectively (see Paleomagnetism).  

When all laboratory processing steps were completed, cores were wrapped in shrink wrap, seale d in plastic tubes, and transferred to cold storage space aboard the ship. At the end of the expedition, the cores were sent to the IODP Gulf Coast Repository, where personal non-ephemeral sample s for postexpedition research were taken in November 2022 prior to forwarding the cores to th e Bremen Core Repository for long-term storage. Basement core flow is summarized in Figure F7.  

# 1.6. Handling of drilling and core disturbance  

Cores may be significantly disturbed and contain extraneous material as a result of the coring an d core handling process (Jutzeler et al., 2014). In formations with loose layers, material from intervals higher in the hole may be washed down by drilling circulation, accumulate at the bottom o f the hole, and be sampled with the next core. The uppermost $10{-}50\,\mathrm{cm}$ of each core must therefor e be examined critically during description for potential “fall-in” material. Common coring-induce d deformation includes the concave-downward appearance of originally horizontal bedding. Pisto n action can result in fluidization (“flow-in”) at the bottom of APC/HLAPC cores. The rotation an d fluid circulation used during XCB and RCB coring can also cause cored material to fragment int o discrete pieces (“biscuits”) that may rotate relative to each other. A slurry of drilling fluid, seawater, and fluidized sediment can be injected between and around the biscuits, producing what is colloquially termed “biscuits and gravy.” Retrieval from depth to the surface can result in elasti c rebound. Gas that is in solution at depth may become free and drive apart core segments withi n the liner. When gas content is high, pressure must be relieved for safety reasons by drilling hole s into the plastic liner before the cores are cut into segments. These holes force some sediment a s well as gas out of the liner. Such observed disturbances are described in each site chapter an d graphically indicated on the visual core descriptions (VCDs).

# 2. Sedimentology  

Sediments and sedimentary rocks recovered during SAT Expeditions 390C, 395E, 390, and 39 3 were described macroscopically from archive-half sections by shipboard scientists during Expeditions 390 and 393. Microscopic descriptions were based on smear slides and thin sections. Digita l color images of all archive-half sections were produced using the SHIL, and visual color determination followed Munsell soil color charts (Munsell Color Company, 1994). Some of the cores wer e obtained in November 2020 (Expedition 390C) and May 2021 (Expedition 395E) and described i n April–August 2022 (during Expeditions 390 and 393) (see Background and objectives in each sit e chapter). Some color differences may exist between the digital color images generated with th e SHIL and the visual color determinations, likely reflecting changes such as postcoring dryin g and/or oxidation of the sediments.  

The description of sedimentary lithologies was supported by XRD analyses, scanning electro n microscope (SEM) photomicrographs, carbonate content measurements (see Geochemistry), an d physical properties measurements (see Physical properties and downhole measurements). Observations were recorded in separate macroscopic (drilling disturbance, lithologic description, and deformational structures) and microscopic (smear slide) DESClogik templates (Versio n x.16.2.0.0; see the DESClogik user guide at https://wiki.iodp.tamu.edu/display/LMUG/DESClogik $^{\cdot+}$ Quick $^{+}$ Start $^+$ Guide). DESClogik templates for Expeditions 390 and 393, including th e tabs referred to in this section, are available in DESC_WKB in Supplementary material. VCD s (Figure F8) provide a summary of observations recorded for each core in the shipboard DESClogi k program including assessment of sediment color, grain size, sedimentary structures, bioturbation, and drilling disturbance (see Core descriptions). Synthesized descriptions and lithostratigraphi c units are presented in the Stratigraphic unit summary and Sedimentology sections of each sit e chapter. The methods employed during these expeditions were similar to those used during IOD P Expeditions 371 and 378 (Sutherland et al., 2019; Röhl et al., 2022).  

# 2.1. Macroscopic descriptions  

# 2.1.1. Section half images  

Standard core splitting can affect the appearance of the section half surface, obscuring fine detail s of lithology and sedimentary structures. Therefore, when required, the archive-half sections wer e scraped parallel to bedding using a stainless steel or glass scraper (from the bottom of the sectio n to the top). For XCB cores with moderately consolidated sediments, water was used to clean th e section half surface before describing. After cleaning the core surface (if necessary), the archiv e half was scanned with the SHIL as soon as possible to avoid color changes caused by oxidation an d sediment drying. In cases of watery or soupy sediment, the surface was dried sufficiently with lintfree wipes prior to scanning to avoid reflected light photographic artifacts. Three pairs o f advanced illumination, high-current, focused LED line lights with adjustable angles to the len s axis illuminated any large cracks and blocks in the core surface and sidewalls. Each of the LE D pairs had a color temperature of $6{,}500\ \mathrm{K}$ and emitted 90,000 lx at $7.62~\mathrm{cm}$ . Digital images wer e taken by a linescan camera at an interval of 10 lines/ $\ m{\bf m}$ to create a high-resolution TIFF file. Th e camera height was set so that each pixel imaged a $0.1\;\mathrm{mm^{2}}$ area of the section half surface. Actua l core width per pixel varied because of slight differences in the section half surface height. JPE G files were created from the high-resolution TIFF files. One set of JPEG image files includes a grayscale reference card and offset ruler; a second set is cropped to include only the section half surface.  

# 2.1.2. Stratification and sedimentary structures  

We described the locations and types of stratification and sedimentary structures visible on th e surfaces of the section halves in the following macroscopic DESClogik worksheet columns: Lithology sedimentary structure, Sedimentary structure abundance, and Bedding thickness. Observations in these columns indicate the locations and scales of interstratification and individua l bedding. The following terminology (based on Stow [2005]) was used to describe the scale of lamination and bedding:  

• Thin lamination $=<\!0.3\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
• Medium lamination $=0.3–0.6\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
• Thick lamination $=0.6–1\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
• Very thin bed $=1{-}3\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
• Thin be $1=3–10\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
• Medium bed $!=10–30\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
• Thick be ${\l}=30{-}100\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
• Very thick bed $=>\!100\,\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.  

The presence of graded beds was entered in the Grading column separately from other sedimentary structures. “Normal grading” corresponds to layers with a gradual decrease in grain size from the bottom to the top of the bed, whereas “reverse grading” corresponds to layers with a gradual increase in grain size from the bottom to the top of the bed.  

# 2.1.3. Bioturbation  

The trace fossils herein were used for interpreting environmental parameters, such as oxygen variations in pore and bottom waters, substrate consistency, sedimentation rate, organic matter availability, and hydraulic energy at the seafloor in the past geologic epochs. The bioturbation index (BI) is a semiquantitative assessment of bioturbation intensity based on the percentage grades of sediment reworked by organismal activity (cf. Reineck, 1963; Taylor and Goldring, 1993; Taylor e t al., 2003). We reported seven levels of bioturbation intensity in the Bioturbation index column i n DESClogik (Figure F9):  

![](images/0f61b923b96bf239223c48d94e6feb0512437549f646cd486bb285dcf7276589.jpg)  
Figure F8. Example sediment VCD summarizing data from core imaging, macro- and microscopic description, and physical properties measurements, Expedition 390/393. cps $=$ counts per second. See Figure F10 for lithologic symbol descriptions.  

• Absent: no bioturbation $(0\%)$ .   
• Sparse: few discrete traces and/or escape structures $(<\!10\%)$ .   
• Low: bedding is distinct, low trace density, escape structures are often common $(10\%{-}30\%)$ .   
• Moderate: bedding boundaries are sharp, traces are discrete $(>\!30\%{-}60\%)$ .   
• High: bedding boundaries are indistinct, high trace density with overlap common $(>\!60\%{-90\%})$ .   
• Intense: bedding is completely disturbed, limited reworking due to repeated overprinting $(>\!90\%)$ .   
• Complete: sediment reworking due to repeated overprinting $(100\%)$ .  

# 2.1.4. Biogenic sedimentary structures  

During Expedition 393, a new Bioturbation tab was added to the DESClogik template to describ e in detail intervals with biogenic mottling and distinct biogenic sedimentary structures. In additio n to characterizing bioturbation intensity (as described in Bioturbation above), Expedition 39 3 shipboard scientists specified the four most common trace fossils observed (as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th dominant ichnofossils), defined ichnofossil diversity as the total number of identifie d ichnofossils, measured the maximum trace fossil diameter, and added comments in an Ichnofossi l comment column for extra observations and details. The most common trace fossils, namely Zoophycos, Chondrites, Planolites, Palaeophycus, Thalassinoides, Skolithos, Nereites/Cosmorhaphe, Phycosiphon, and rarely Arenicolites, Cylindrichnus, and Spirophyton, were defined based on various atlases, books, and scientific papers devoted to ichnological analysis of cores from moder n marine sediments (Bromley and Ekdale, 1984; Buatois and Mángano, 2011; Dorador et al., 2020; Ekdale and Bromley, 1984, 1991; Pemberton et al., 2009; Rodríguez-Tovar and Dorador, 2015; Wetzel et al., 2010).  

# 2.1.5. Lithology sedimentary structures  

The locations and types of sedimentary structures that are not a result of drilling disturbanc e observed on the surfaces of the section halves were selected in the Sedimentary structure colum n in DESClogik and assigned to, for example (commonly used), cross-lamination/stratification, interlamination/stratification, trends in grain size (coarsening or fining upward), ripple, lens o r pods, or “trails, tracks, and burrows” for trace fossils. Additionally, the terms “mottling” or “indistinct mottling” were used where identification of individual ichnotaxa was not possible but th e media had a bioturbated and mottled appearance. The abundance of the sedimentary structures i s quantitatively expressed by the frequency parameters in Table T1. When mottling was present, both a sedimentary structure abundance (Table T1) and a bioturbation index were assigned i n DESClogik, assuming mottling was due to bioturbation, unless otherwise noted (e.g., “sedimen t mottling”).

# 2.1.6. Lithologic contacts and consolidation state  

We described bottom contact geometry for every distinct lithologic interval recorded and entere d in DESClogik using these terms: bioturbated, gradational, erosive, planar, irregular, and sharp. Also, the attitude of the lithologic bottom contacts was described as curved, horizontal, subhorizontal, inclined, or steeply dipping $(\sqrt{-45^{\circ}})$ . For comparison, the lithologic contact that mark s the top/bottom limit of a unit/subunit is defined as a “boundary.” We reported the degree of lithification of the sediments as unconsolidated, moderately consolidated, or lithified.  

# 2.1.7. Drilling disturbance  

We recorded drilling-related sediment disturbances for each core (see Disturbance column; Figures F8, F10). The type of drilling disturbance for soft (unconsolidated) and firm (moderatel y consolidated) sediment were described using these terms:  

• Fall-in: out of place material at the top of a core that fell downhole onto the cored surface.   
• Bowed: bedding contacts slightly–moderately deformed but still subhorizontal and continuous.   
• Uparching: material retains coherency; material closest to the core liner bent downward.   
• Void: empty space in the cored material (e.g., caused by gas or sediment expansion during core retrieval). To the extent possible, voids were closed on the core receiving platform by pushing the recovered intervals toward the top of the core before cutting the sections. The space left at the bottom of the core below all the recovered material due to incomplete recovery was not described as a void.   
• Flow-in, coring/drilling slurry, or along-core gravel/sand contamination: soft-sediment stretching and/or compressional shearing structures when severe.   
• Soupy or mousse-like: water-saturated intervals that have lost all aspects of original bedding.   
• Biscuit: sediment of intermediate stiffness with vertical variations in the degree of disturbance, whereas firmer intervals are relatively undisturbed.   
• Cracked or fractured: firm sediment broken during drilling; not displaced or rotated significantly.   
• Fragmented or pulverized: firm sediment pervasively broken by drilling; may be displaced or rotated.   
• Drilling breccia: core is crushed and broken into many small and angular pieces; original orientation and stratigraphic position are affected.  

# Each instance of drilling disturbance was assigned a degree of severity:  

• Slight: core material is in place but broken or otherwise disturbed.   
• Moderate: core material is in place or partly displaced, but original orientation is preserved or recognizable.

• Severe: core material is probably in the correct stratigraphic sequence, but original orientation is lost.   
• Destroyed: core material is in the incorrect stratigraphic sequence, and original orientation is lost. In the case of voids, core material is absent.  

# 2.2. Microscopic descriptions  

# 2.2.1. Smear slide descriptions  

We estimated sediment constituent size, composition, and abundance microscopically using smear slides. Smear slide samples of the main lithologies were collected from the archive-half sections. Additional samples were collected from areas of interest, such as distinct intervals (e.g., organic-rich layers or diatom or foraminiferal oozes).  

![](images/7aea5d58fa00e5069d69dc2bf2369e8c30fb0b6353ecca8a02eb2d9254ecc6ba.jpg)  
Figure F10. Symbols used for sediment VCDs, graphic logs, and hole summaries, Expedition 390/393.  

For each smear slide, a small amount of sediment was removed from the section half using a fla t wooden toothpick and put on a $25\:\mathrm{mm}\times75\:\mathrm{mm}$ glass slide. A drop of deionized water was adde d to the sediment, and the sediment was homogenized with the toothpick and evenly spread acros s the glass slide. The dispersed sample was dried on a hot plate at a low setting $(110^{\circ}{-}120^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . A dro p of adhesive (Norland optical adhesive Number 61) was added as a mounting medium for a glas s coverslip, which was carefully placed on the dried sample to prevent air bubbles from bein g trapped in the adhesive. The smear slide was then fixed in a UV light box for $5{-}10\,\mathrm{min}$ to cure th e adhesive.  

Smear slides were examined with a transmitted-light petrographic microscope (Carl Zeiss AXI O with a HAL 100 halogen lamp) equipped with a standard eyepiece micrometer and a SPOT Insigh t FireWire digital camera. Biogenic and mineral components were identified following standar d petrographic techniques as described in the Rothwell (1989), Marsaglia et al. (2013, 2015), Scholl e and Ulmer-Scholle (2003), and Ulmer-Scholle et al. (2015) reference manuals and books. Severa l fields of view were examined at $10\times$ , $20\times$ , and $40\times$ to assess the abundance of detrital (e.g., quartz, feldspar, clay minerals, mica, and heavy minerals), biogenic (e.g., nannofossils, other calcareou s bioclasts, diatoms, foraminifera, and radiolarians), and authigenic (e.g., carbonate, iron sulfide, iron oxides, and glauconite) components. The average grain size of clay $(<\!4{\mathrm{~}}\upmu{\mathrm{m}})$ , silt $(4{-}63~\upmu\mathrm{m})$ , and sand $(>\!63\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ was estimated for siliciclastic, carbonate, biogenic, and volcaniclastic material. The relative percent abundances of the sedimentary constituents were visually estimated using th e techniques of Rothwell (1989). The texture of siliciclastic lithologies (i.e., relative abundance o f sand-, silt-, and clay-sized grains) and the proportions and presence of biogenic and mineral components were recorded in the smear slide worksheet of the microscopic DESClogik template. Components observed in smear slides were categorized according to their abundance as shown i n Table T1.  

# 2.3. Sediment and sedimentary rock classification  

Sediment and sedimentary rock types were entered in the lithology columns of the macroscopi c DESClogik worksheet. Corresponding patterns and colors were defined on the graphic core summaries and hole summaries during the core descriptions accomplished during Expeditions 39 0 and 393.  

# 2.3.1. Sedimentary lithologic classes  

Following prior IODP expeditions (e.g., Röhl et al., 2022; Sutherland et al., 2019) and the Handbook for Sedimentologists (Mazzullo and Graham, 1988), three main sedimentary lithologi c classes (Figure F11) were defined based on the primary origin of the sediment constituents (bu t not the depositional processes):  

• Biogenic: ${>}50\%$ carbonate, chemical, undifferentiated calcareous bioclasts, and calcareous microfauna and microflora.   
• Siliciclastic: ${>}50\%$ siliciclastic particles, $<\!25\%$ volcanic particles, and ${<}50\%$ biogenic particles; therefore, nonvolcanic siliciclastic particles dominate over chemical and biogenic particles.   
• Volcaniclastic: $>\!25\%$ volcanic particles. In this class, volcanic sediments are defined as $>\!75\%$ of volcanic clasts and grains, whereas tuffaceous sediments contain $75\%{-}25\%$ volcanic clasts and grains mixed with nonvolcanic particles (either nonvolcanic siliciclastic, biogenic, or both). The definition of the term “tuffaceous” $\langle25\%{-}75\%$ volcanic particles) was modified from Fisher and Schmincke (1984). Note that the term “volcaniclastic” was used following Fisher (1961) and therefore includes both volcanic and tuffaceous lithologies.  

These three lithologic classes formed the basis of the principal name of the described sediment s and sedimentary rocks, with appropriate prefixes and suffixes that could be chosen for mixe d lithologies (see Principal names and modifiers below).  

# 2.3.2. Principal names and modifiers  

The principal name was based on the most abundant sediment class (Figure F11). Principal name s for the siliciclastic class were adapted from the grain size classes of Wentworth (1922), wherea s principal names for the volcaniclastic class were adapted from the grain size classes of Fisher an d  

Schmincke (1984). Thus, the Wentworth (1922) and Fisher and Schmincke (1984) classification s were used to refer to particle type (siliciclastic versus volcanic, respectively) and the maximu m size of the particles. For the biogenic sediment class, commonly used terms were applied (e.g., ooze and chalk) and did not have a separate size or texture notation because those aspects ar e inherent in the fossil groups that make up the sediment. For example, nannofossil and foraminiferal ooze imply a dominant grain size corresponding to clay and sand, respectively. For each principal name, both a lithified and a nonconsolidated term exist that are mutually exclusive (e.g., cla y or claystone; ash or tuff).  

For all lithologies, the principal lithologic name was modified by prefixes and/or suffixes representing secondary components as follows:  

• Prefixes describe a secondary component with abundance of $25\%{-}50\%$ (corresponding to “abundant” in smear slide descriptions) (Table T1).   
• Suffixes are secondary or tertiary components with abundances of $10\%{-25\%}$ (corresponding to “common” in smear slide descriptions) and are indicated by the suffix “with” (e.g., with clay or with radiolarians) in order of decreasing abundance.  

For example, an unconsolidated sediment containing $45\%$ nannofossils, $30\%$ clay, $15\%$ foraminifera, and $10\%$ radiolarians is described as clayey nannofossil ooze with foraminifera and radiolarians.  

![](images/cf0ae38defcc2e0fc873c73c389197003302f7bd1ff8a751431b559f7bc57897.jpg)  
Figure F11. Sedimentary lithology naming conventions based on relative abundances of grain and clast types, Expeditio n 390/393.  

The degree of lithification was expressed in the principal name using terms common in geology:  

Siliciclastic class: • If the sediment could be deformed with a gloved finger, no lithification term was applied (e.g., clay). • If the sediment could not be deformed with a gloved finger or scratched with a fingernail, the suffix “-stone” was added to the grain size identifier (e.g., claystone).   
Biogenic class: • If the sediment could be deformed easily with a gloved finger, the unconsolidated term “ooze” was used in conjunction with the most abundant component (e.g., nannofossil ooze or radiolarian ooze). • If the source of the calcareous sediment was unclear (fragments of carbonate bioclasts ${<}4$ $\upmu\mathrm{m})$ the generic term “calcareous ooze” was used. • If the calcareous sediment could not be deformed easily with a gloved finger but could be easily scratched with a fingernail, the lithified term “chalk” was used for calcareous sediments (e.g., nannofossil chalk) and the terms “radiolarite,” “diatomite,” and “porcellanite” were used for siliceous sediments according to their most dominant component. • If the sediment could not be scratched easily with a fingernail, the lithified term “limestone” was used for calcareous sediments (e.g., foraminiferal limestone). • If siliceous sediment could not be scratched with a fingernail and displayed a glassy luster, the term “chert” was used.   
Volcaniclastic class:   
• If the sediment could be deformed easily with a gloved finger, the terms “ash” and “lapilli” were applied. • If the sediment could not be deformed easily with a gloved finger, the terms “tuff” and “lapillistone” would have been used, but these lithologies were not encountered during the SAT expeditions.  

# 2.3.3. Lithologic accessories  

Lithologic, diagenetic, and paleontological features other than those delineated above wer e entered in the Lithologic accessories column and depicted using symbols in the VCDs (Figures F8, F10). Accessories included macroscopic biogenic remains, such as shells, sponge spicule aggregates, worm tubes, wood fragments, and mottling (e.g., ash, sand, and pyrite) as well as clasts, concretions, nodules, alteration halos, and blebs. When possible, clasts, concretions, and nodule s were described on the basis of their composition:  

• Concretion: small irregularly rounded knot, mass, or lump of a mineral or mineral aggregate that has a warty or knobby surface and no internal structure and usually exhibits a contrasting composition from the sediment or rock matrix within which it is embedded.   
• Nodule: regular globular structure with a contrasting composition, such as pyrite, to the surrounding sediments.   
• Alteration halo: ring surrounding a grain or accessory phase where sediment has a different color or composition.   
• Blebs (centimeter scale) and specks (millimeter scale): spots or smears where the material has a different color or composition than the surrounding sediment (not ring shaped like an alteration halo).  

# 2.4. Spectrophotometry  

We measured reflectance of visible light from the archive-half cores using an Ocean Optic s USB4000 spectrophotometer mounted on the automated SHMSL. Freshly split sediment core s were covered with clear plastic wrap and placed on the SHMSL. Measurements were taken at 1. 0 or $2.0\;\mathrm{cm}$ spacing to provide a high-resolution stratigraphic record of color variations for visibl e wavelengths. Spectral data are routinely reduced to the $\mathrm{{L}^{\ast}\mathrm{{a}^{\ast}\mathrm{{b}^{\ast}}}}$ color space for output and presentation, in which $L^{*}$ is lightness (greater value $=$ lighter) in the range between 0 (black) and 10 0 (white), $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ is the red-green value (greater value $=$ redder) in the range between $-60$ (green) and 6 0 (red), and $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ is the yellow-blue value (greater value $=$ yellower) in the range between $-60$ (blue ) and 60 (yellow). The color reflectance spectrometer calibrates on two spectra, pure white (reference) and pure black (dark). Each measurement $\left(\sim\!5\mathrm{~s}\right)$ was recorded in wide spectral bands fro m 400 to $900\;\mathrm{nm}$ in $2\;\mathrm{nm}$ steps.  

The SHMSL takes measurements in empty intervals and over intervals where the core surface i s well below the level of the core liner, but it cannot recognize relatively small cracks, disturbe d areas of core, or plastic section dividers. Thus, the SHMSL data may contain spurious measurements that have to be edited out of the data set by the user. Additional detailed information abou t measurement and interpretation of spectral data can be found in Balsam et al. (1997, 1998) an d Balsam and Damuth (2000).  

# 2.5. X-ray diffraction analysis  

We prepared samples for XRD analysis for semiquantitative bulk mineral estimates. The XR D results combined with smear slide estimates, weight percent carbonate, and visual description s were used to assist in lithologic classification. During Expedition 390, in general, $5~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ sample s were routinely taken for analysis from each core retrieved using the APC, XCB, and RCB systems. If XRD was required to determine the lithology, we analyzed additional samples based on visua l core observations (e.g., color variability and visual changes in lithology and texture) and smea r slides. In general, XRD samples were taken adjacent to MAD samples (see Physical propertie s and downhole measurements) or using material left over from the samples used for alternatin g field (AF) demagnetization (see Paleomagnetism) or from IW squeeze cake residue (see Geochemistry).  

Samples for XRD analysis were freeze-dried for $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ and either ground by hand or in an agate bal l mill, depending on sediment lithification. During Expeditions 390C, 395E, and 390, the sample s were top-mounted onto a sample holder and analyzed using a Bruker D4 Endeavor diffractomete r mounted with a Vantec-1 detector using nickel-filtered $C\mathrm{{uK}\alpha}$ radiation. The standard locked coupled scan was as follows:  

• Voltage $=40\,\mathrm{kV}$ .   
• Current $=40\;\mathrm{mA}$ .   
• Goniometer angle $=4^{\circ}–61.715^{\circ}2\theta$ .   
• Step size $=0.01649^{\circ}26$ .   
• Scan speed $=0.18\;\mathbf{s}/$ step.   
• Divergence slit $=0.6\;\mathrm{mm}$ .  

During Expedition 393, XRD measurements were always coupled with coulometry analyses an d were required to determine the lithology complementing visual core observations (e.g., color variability and visual changes in lithology and texture). Identical sample preparation to Expedition 39 0 was used, but samples were analyzed using a Malvern Panalytical Aeris diffractometer (Table T2). The standard locked coupled scan was as follows:

Expedition 390 diffractograms of bulk samples were analyzed with the DIFFRAC.EVA softwar e package, whereas those from Expedition 393 were analyzed with the Panalytical HighScore Plu s software (Table T2). Both allowed for mineral identification and basic peak characterization (e.g., baseline removal and maximum peak intensity).  

# 2.5.1. Semiquantitative and qualitative XRD analyses of primary phases  

During Expedition 390, we carried out semiquantitative XRD analyses following the method s described during IODP Expedition 372B/375 (Underwood et al., 2020). Diagnostic net peak area s (recorded in units of counts $\mathbf{\chi}_{\mathbf{S}}\times$ angle [in degrees 2-theta], measured above the baseline) for eac h mineral (or mineral group) were determined using the “create area” function in DIFFRAC.EVA; that function accommodates manual adjustment of the upper and lower limits of the peaks. Diagnostic peaks for weight percent computation are composite clay minerals $\left(19.4^{\circ}{-}20.4^{\circ}26\right.$ ; area), quartz [101] $(26.3^{\circ}{-}27.0^{\circ}26\$ ; area), feldspar composite $(27.4^{\circ}{-}28.2^{\circ}26\$ ; area), and calcite [104 ] $(29.1^{\circ}{-}29.7^{\circ}26\$ ; area). Polynomial regression plots (together with corresponding equations) for th e weight percent and net peak area values were generated by the Bruker diffractometer on JOIDE S Resolution and DIFFRAC.EVA software. Shipboard data analysis focused on determining the relative contribution of four primary phases: total clay (mineral), quartz, feldspar, and calcite. Th e absolute error of the computed weight percent averages less than $3\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Underwood et al., 2020). The XRD data are available from the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) database as digital files.  

During Expedition 393, we carried out qualitative XRD analyses using the Panalytical HighScor e Plus software and the following method. The background of the XRD spectra was first fitted in th e software using a bending factor selected by the user to preserve all measured peaks. Peak position s were then automatically located by the software, with the minimum significance defined by th e user for each spectrum such that all detected peaks were recognized. First, a broad pass search o f all minerals in the database identified the dominant mineral phases of sediments, which were calcite and quartz most of the time. Second, a restricted search was made on just clay family mineral s including illite, kaolinite, chlorite, and smectite. Third, a restricted search was made on just feldspar family minerals. From the clay and feldspar family searches, any minerals that are known t o be present in deep-sea sediments and that scored a match were added to the pattern list. Thi s multistep pattern search was found to better locate potential matches for clay and feldspar phase s recognized but not identified during smear slide examination. Rietveld fitting analysis then usuall y reduced this large list of possible minerals down to a best-fit set of minerals and estimated abundances that could explain all the diffraction peaks (Table T3). One way to evaluate the potentia l accuracy of Rietveld fitting is to compare the estimated abundance of calcite with an independen t $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ weight percent measurement of the same material. Because XRD analyses and $C a C O_{3}$ determinations (see Geochemistry) were performed on the same samples, we could compare th e values of calcite abundances estimated with the Rietveld refinement and $C a C O_{3}$ weight percen t from coulometry analysis. The resulting plot shows a decent correlation between both techniques; however, it also includes three outliers (excluded from the correlation) (Figure F12). We observe d that three dominant calcite peaks (Samples 393-U1558F-3H-1, $70{-}72~\mathrm{cm}$ ; 4H-1, $31{-}33~\mathrm{cm};$ ; an d 19H-2, $25{-}27~\mathrm{cm})$ were ignored during Rietveld refinement, and consequently this techniqu e underestimated the calcite content. Therefore, we did not use the Rietveld refinement to estimat e semiquantitative mineral abundances but interpreted the diffractogram peaks and matches provided by the software to identify the various minerals that may be present in the samples.

# 3. Igneous petrology  

# 3.1. Hard rock visual core descriptions  

Each section of core was examined consecutively by two teams of describers, focusing first o n igneous characteristics (recorded principally in the igneous log described here) and then on alteration (recorded principally in the alteration and vein and mineral fill logs described in Alteratio n petrology). Each team described all sections of hard rock cores.  

Hard rock VCDs summarize observations from each section of the igneous rock cores (see Cor e descriptions). An example VCD is given in Figure F13, and a key to the symbols used on th e VCDs is given in Figure F14. From left to right on the VCDs, the following are displayed:  

• Depth,   
• Section length scale,   
• Piece number,   
• Photograph of the archive half of the core,   
• Arrow indicating whether a piece is oriented,   
• Indication of whether a DMT whole-round image is available, • Location of samples selected for shipboard studies,   
• Graphical representation of the rock type and emplacement style, • Lithologic unit,   
• Phenocryst abundance and mineralogy,   
• Presence of glass or altered glass,   
• Groundmass grain size,   
• Vesicularity,   
• Alteration intensity, and   
• Veins.

The Lithologic unit column displays the locations of the boundaries between units and subunit s and the unit designator (e.g., 1, 2A, and 2B).  

The boundaries of the lithologic units and subunits were drawn on the VCDs across column s (solid lines $=$ unit boundaries; dotted lines $=$ subunit boundaries). VCDs also contain a tex t description of each unit in each section of core that includes the following:  

• Expedition, site, hole, core number, core type, and section number;   
• Unit number (consecutive downhole; subunits are designated by letters after the unit number [e.g., 1, 2A, and 2B]); note that any sedimentary units within the basement were also numbered consecutively downhole but were numbered separately from igneous units and were distinguished from them with the letter ${}^{\iota}{\cal S}^{\prime\prime}$ (e.g., S1 and S2); minor amounts of sediment incorporated into various breccias were not identified as separate units;   
• Lithology;   
• Summary description of the unit as it appears in the section, including a brief rock name and the interpreted emplacement of the rock (e.g., pillow basalt or sheet flow);   
• Textural summary;   
• Color summary;

# 3.2. Describing igneous cores  

# 3.2.1. Expedition 390  

The procedures and methods for igneous rock core descriptions used during Expedition 390 wer e modified from those adopted during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 187 (Shipboard Scientifi c Party, 2001); Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 309/312, 329, and 335 (Expeditio n 309/312 Scientists, 2006; Expedition 329 Scientists, 2011; Expedition 335 Scientists, 2012a); an d IODP Expedition 385 (Teske et al., 2021). Much of the discussion presented here comes fro m those sources. In general, written descriptions sought to include the following information:  

• Lithologic unit number (numbered consecutively downhole; see Lithologic units) and rock name (see Rock classification).   
• Descriptions of contact relationships with neighboring lithologic units and of contact relationships within lithologic units (see Igneous contacts). The latter may include descriptions of textural variations across chilled margins and note the presence of sediment adhering to pillow lava pieces or occurring between clasts in rubble or talus.   
• List of phenocryst types visible with a hand lens or a binocular microscope: distribution, abundance, size, shape, and degree of alteration and other characteristics.   
• Description of groundmass texture and grain size (see Rock classification).   
• Abundance of vesicles by volume; their distribution, size, and shape; and the presence/absence of mineral linings and fillings (see Rock classification). The method used to make detailed description of minerals filling vesicles, including their abundance, is given in Alteration petrology.   
• Description of color using the Munsell color chart on the dry rock surface.   
• Description of the igneous structure (i.e., whether the unit is massive, pillow, sheet flow, etc.) (see Rock structure).   
• Qualitative assessment of the degree of alteration (see Unit alteration). A detailed description of veins and fractures, including their abundance, width, mineral linings and fillings, and, where possible, their orientation, was carried out as part of alteration and vein logging. The corresponding methods are given in Alteration petrology.  

# 3.2.2. Expedition 393  

During Expedition 393, the same observations were made and recorded using DESClogik as thos e made during Expedition 390 to ensure comparability along the SAT. To improve efficiency wit h the different size of the core description team, the sequence of observations was slightly modifie d and some additional observations were also made. These changes are set out in addenda to eac h methods section.  

Previously, volcanic glass was macroscopically logged across the Extrusive hypabyssal, Glass, an d Alteration tabs in DESClogik. During Expedition 393, the observation of glass on the Extrusiv e hypabyssal tab was simplified to Present or not, with the more detailed observations made on th e Glass and Alteration tabs. Based on the entries for Glass physical occurrence (a free text comment) in the Glass tab during Expedition 390, this was modified during Expedition 393 to a valu e list with the following options:  

• Chilled margin clast in hyaloclastite, • Glass fragments in hyaloclastite, • Chilled margin at top of piece,   
• Glass fragments in breccia,   
• Chilled margin (unoriented),   
• Chilled margin at bottom of piece, • Internal chilled margin,   
• Palagonite,   
• Glass fragments,   
• Chilled margin on side of piece,   
• Double chilled margin,   
• Discrete glass clast, and   
• Thin glassy margin.  

# 3.3. Lithologic units  

The division of igneous lithologic units and subunits used the criteria of changing grain size, occurrence of contacts or chilled margins, changes in petrographic type, and phenocryst abundances. Generally, boundaries were not defined on the basis of type or degree of alteration o r deformation. Lithologic units defined as rubble, breccia, or talus may consist of more than on e rock type; such units were generally identified by the random mixture of lithologic types in th e core, a predominance of weathered rounded surfaces, and/or cementing sediments.  

Lithologically and texturally similar pieces from consecutive core sections were assigned to th e same unit. To preserve important information about igneous stratigraphy without defining a n unreasonable number of units within a single core, subunits were designated in cases where ther e were marked changes in texture without accompanying changes in mineralogy or vice versa. Where contacts deviated from horizontal within the core reference frame, their depth was logge d at their midpoint.  

During Expedition 393, division of igneous units was supported by pXRF analyses on the cut cor e surfaces and evaluated downhole during core description. The key ratios and elements that wer e monitored downhole were $\mathrm{{Cr/Ti}}$ to assess degree of fractionation and $\mathrm{Zr/Ti}$ to assess incompatibl e element enrichment or depletion (e.g., depleted mid-ocean-ridge basalt [D-MORB] versu s enriched MORB [E-MORB]). Details of the Expedition 393 pXRF method, calibration, precision, and accuracy are given in Geochemistry.  

# 3.4. Rock classification  

Rock names were assigned initially on the basis of hand-specimen observations of groundmas s texture/color as well as the nature of phenocryst phases, if present. These were later checked wit h representative thin sections. Rock names were assigned based on the primary phases present prio r to alteration.  

Porphyritic rocks are named by phenocryst type and their relative abundances as follows:  

• Aphyric: phenocrysts constitute ${<}1\%$ of the volume of the rock.   
• Sparsely phyric: phenocryst content ranges $1\%{-}5\%$ .   
• Moderately phyric: phenocryst content ranges $5\%{-}10\%$ .   
• Highly phyric: phenocryst content $>\!10\%$ .  

Note that the term “phenocryst” is used for a crystal that is significantly larger than the averag e size of the groundmass crystals (typically ${\sim}5{\times})$ ) and generally euhedral in shape. The names o f phenocryst phases are listed in order of decreasing abundance. Thus, a highly olivine-plagioclasephyric basalt contains $>\!10\%$ (by volume) phenocrysts and the dominant phenocryst is olivine wit h lesser amounts of plagioclase. The minerals named include all of the phenocryst phases in th e rock, as long as the total content is ${>}1\%$ .  

The term “glass” was reserved for a homogeneous, isotropic material free of quench crystals, wit h $-2\%$ alteration. For ease of reference, all altered or hydrated glass was lumped under the ter m “palagonite” during Expedition 390, but the more generic designation of “altered glass” was use d during Expedition 393, following the advice of Honnorez (1981). In chilled margins, glass containing discrete spherulitic quench growth was distinguished from clear glass free of these textures.  

Phenocrysts were also characterized by their size (in millimeters) and shape, where the shap e categories were defined as follows:  

• Equant: aspect ratio $=$ less than 1:2.   
• Subequant: aspect ratio $=1:2$ to 1:3.   
• Tabular: aspect ratio $=1{:}3$ to 1:5.   
• Elongate: aspect ratio $=$ more than 1:5.  

The description of groundmass at the macro scale is on the basis of the predominant grain size, with more detailed description of texture provided through thin section observation (see Thi n section descriptions). Note that particularly for intervals dominated by pillow lavas, grain size s could vary from glassy to microcrystalline or even fine grained over distances of just a few centimeters. Average grain sizes were assigned on the basis of the predominant grain size in the roc k and interval. A cryptocrystalline basalt, for example, would consist predominantly of phases tha t were ${<}0.1\ \mathrm{mm}$ but could contain some microcrystalline plagioclase or olivine microlites. Grai n size categories used were as follows:  

• Glassy, • Cryptocrystalline $(<\!0.1\;\mathrm{mm})$ , • Microcrystalline $(0.1{-}0.2\ \mathrm{mm})$ , $\bullet$ Fine grained $(>\!0.2–1\ \mathrm{mm})$ , • Medium grained $\left(>\mathrm{{1-2}\ m m}\right)$ , and • Coarse grained $>\!2\,\mathrm{mm}$ ).  

Vesicles were described by their abundance, size, and shape/roundness (low, moderate, high, an d highly elongate). Vesicles were noted as filled or unfilled, but the nature of filling minerals wa s detailed during alteration logging (see Alteration petrology). The following abundance categorie s were used:  

• Nonvesicular $(<\!1\%)$ , • Sparsely vesicular $(1\%-5\%)$ , • Moderately vesicular $(>\!5\%{-}20\%)$ , and • Highly vesicular $(>\!20\%)$ ).  

Groundmass grain size designations during Expedition 393 were typically defined by the moda l grain size of groundmass plagioclase or, more rarely, olivine microlites as assessed by binocula r microscope. Consequently, a basalt with abundant microcrystalline groundmass plagioclase lath s but cryptocrystalline interstitial clinopyroxene was classified as microcrystalline. Where described intervals encompass one or more lava flows, the logged groundmass grain size for tha t interval refers to that of the flow interior, not the cryptocrystalline to glassy chilled margins, th e presence of which was noted in the groundmass comments and glass columns. Primary crystal s present in flow interiors but not in the glassy margins were assumed to have crystallized in sit u and were considered as part of the groundmass, not as phenocrysts. However, the distinction between phenocryst and groundmass phases becomes somewhat blurred in more coarsely crystallized or seriate textures typical of massive flows greater than ${\sim}3\;\mathrm{m}$ thick.  

# 3.5. Rock structure  

Igneous structure was determined by whether the rock is massive, sheeted, pillowed, hyaloclastic, brecciated, scoriaceous, or tuffaceous. These terms provide a picture of the style of magmatis m and the environmental setting in which they occur by identifying features that are diagnostic o f specific physical processes.  

• Massive basalts: distinguished by long $(50{-}60\ \mathrm{cm})$ ) continuous core pieces that are relatively unaffected by drilling, and by their uniform texture.   
• Pillow basalts: characterized by chilled pillow margins that are mostly curved or inclined, radial fracture patterns, and V-shaped piece outlines. They are also typically cryptocrystalline to microcrystalline and associated with the presence of hyaloclastic breccias.   
• Sheet flows: characterized by parallel, closely spaced ( $_{<0.5\mathrm{~m~}}$ apart), mainly horizontal, flat glassy selvages distinct from the rounded or inclined margins for pillows.   
• Dike: any sharp, well-defined, and relatively thick $({>}1\;\mathrm{cm})$ crosscutting feature formed by injection of magma; dikes typically have 1–2 chilled margins. In the absence of distinguishing features, samples were labeled as lava flows.   
• Basaltic rubble: distinguished by pieces with semirounded shapes having multiple weathered surfaces that were not cut by the drill. Usually rubble can be recognized as originating from pillow basalts, based on the criteria above.   
• Chilled margins: typically composed of an outer $1{-}10\;\mathrm{mm}$ glassy rind that grades through a discrete spherulitic zone into a coalesced spherulitic zone followed by variolitic textures. The variolitic zones are usually identifiable in hand specimen because the mesostasis is altered to a light brown color, highlighting the variolitic texture. Many of the glassy rims have attached veneers or crosscutting veins of interpillow sediment that is carbonate or clay rich. Sediments may be present as fracture fill or as a cement for basaltic breccias.  

In contrast to Expedition 390 but similar to previous Expedition 309/312 (Expedition 309/31 2 Scientists, 2006), sheet flows during Expedition 393 were recognized and defined as single lav a flows $<\!3\textrm{m}$ thick with gradational changes in internal grain size. Consistent microcrystalline t o fine grain size, planar and subhorizontal glassy margins, and coalesced vuggy vesicles were take n as supporting evidence for emplacement as sheet or massive flows.  

During Expedition 393, massive flows were defined as single lava flows $>\!3\textrm{m}$ thick, with gradational grain size changes and fine- to medium-grained flow interiors used to establish continuit y across pieces and sections (following Expedition 309/312 Scientists [2006]). Note that this contrasts with the $0.5\;\mathrm{m}$ threshold used during Expedition 390.  

# 3.6. Breccias  

Breccias were entered into the main igneous log but described in further detail collaborativel y between the igneous and alteration petrology teams using a separate breccias sheet. They wer e divided principally into the following:  

• Magmatic breccias: containing glass or quench textures such as pillow breccia, primary matrix minerals (or sediments);   
• Hyaloclastites: as above with ${>}30\%$ glass;   
• Hydrothermal breccias: with secondary matrix or vein minerals;   
• Tectonic breccias: such as cataclasites and fault gouges in which the matrix consists of the same material as the host rock; and   
• Sedimentary breccias: characterized by matrix filling composed entirely of sedimentary materials such as clays and carbonate.  

Breccia characteristics such as clast lithology, volume, size, sorting, alteration, and shape, as wel l as matrix and cement composition were recorded.  

We defined matrix as anything granular consisting of fragments of rocks or minerals and cement s as anything crystalline that precipitated in situ to fill void space. Thus, a magmatic breccia migh t have no cement, and a hydrothermal breccia might have no matrix. The method adopted was a s follows:  

1. Assign breccia type (see Breccia type, below) and define whether clast or matrix supported.   
2. Estimate clast volume proportion (percentage), clast size range (minimum/maximum, in millimeters), and sorting (see Breccia sorting).   
3. Record clast lithology (see Clast/matrix composition), alteration (see Clast/matrix alteration), shape (see Clast/matrix shape), grain size (see Clast/matrix internal grain size), and internal structure (see Clast internal structure).   
4. Estimate matrix volume proportion (percentage), identify matrix composition (same values as Clast/matrix composition) and alteration (same values as Clast/matrix alteration), and record any internal structure (same values as Clast/matrix internal grain size).   
5. Identify cement mineral composition, and estimate volume proportion (percentage).   
6. Record any further details as a comment.  

Definitions for breccia descriptions noted above include the following:  

• Breccia type: magmatic breccia, hyaloclastite, hydrothermal breccia, tectonic breccia, and sedimentary breccia.   
• Breccia sorting: poorly, moderately, moderately well, well, very well, and bimodal.   
• Clast/matrix composition: glass, basalt, dolerite, gabbro, peridotite, serpentinite, chert, mudstone, siltstone, limestone, sandstone, sediment—siliceous, sediment—calcareous, and sediment—undifferentiated.   
• Clast/matrix alteration: • Fresh/unaltered $=-2\%$ alteration. • Slight $=2\%{-}10\%$ alteration. • Moderate $=>\!10\%{-}50\%$ alteration. • $\mathrm{High}=>\!50\%{-95\%}$ alteration. • Complete $=>\!95\%{-}100\%$ alteration.   
• Clast shape: angular, subangular, subrounded, rounded   
• Clast/matrix internal grain size: cryptocrystalline, microcrystalline, fine grained, medium grained, coarse grained, glassy.   
• Clast internal structure: none, veined, glassy, crystalline, vesicular, aphyric, sparsely phyric, moderately phyric, highly phyric.  

To allow quantitative recalculation of different breccia components, during Expedition 393 th e areal proportion of breccia on the cut surface of the archive half of the logged breccia interval wa s recorded as a percentage under Breccia comments. The percentage of different clast or matri x types were similarly recorded as areal percentages of the cut core surface under Clast comment s and Matrix comments.  

# 3.7. Intermingled and interlayered sediment  

Intermingled or interlaying of thin (meta)sediment with igneous rock was included in the igneou s rock description upon encountering magma/sediment contacts or mixing (e.g., from fragmentation of igneous material or injection of sediment into igneous rock). Thicker and more coheren t intervals of sediment were described as part of the sedimentary section.  

During Expedition 393, discrete sediment layers were generally described under their own interval, and in several cases even relatively thin $({\sim}5{-}10\;\mathrm{cm})$ layers were split in lithologic (sub)units i n order to promote assessment of changing lava compositions over these possible volcanic hiatuses. The catch-all nongenetic term “indurated calcareous sediment” was used to identify indurate d intervolcanic materials, which could include materials derived from sedimentary and/or volcani c sources (e.g., volcanic glasses), some exhibiting recrystallization and/or hydrothermal alteration.  

# 3.8. Igneous contacts  

Glassy margins, chilled margins, and contact boundaries were inserted individually for the top an d bottom of each interval where they could be determined. Contacts may be sharp or gradational.  

The following contact types were defined:  

• Baked contact: boundary to sediments overprinted (baked) by proximity of magma.   
• Bottom or top chilled contact: chilled contact with sediments, with or without glass adjacent to sediments.   
• Bottom or top chilled margin: chilled contact without sediments, without glass, defined by cryptocrystalline groundmass, and typically found quenched next to the chilled contact.   
• Chilled contact: a magma or lava that has clearly chilled against another rock or sediment.   
• Chilled margin: a rapidly chilled margin, for example with a cryptocrystalline, or incomplete variolitic to glassy selvage.   
• Glassy margin: a rapidly chilled margin with preserved glass.   
• Grain size: units on either side have markedly different grain sizes.   
• Modal boundary or contact: units on either side have markedly different mineral proportions.   
• Brecciated flow top: consists of angular, scoriaceous to vesicular fragments of basaltic rubble.   
• Contact not recovered.  

During Expedition 393, contacts were differentiated as “within-unit” and “upper unit” contact s using the same value lists as Expedition 390 to facilitate easy location and extraction of unit contact information.  

# 3.9. Unit alteration  

A qualitative assessment of alteration was included along with the description of the igneou s petrology to record the overall extent of alteration in that igneous unit/subunit. Separate detaile d alteration and vein logs were made, and the associated methods are described in Alteratio n petrology. Qualitative alteration categories were as follows:  

• Fresh/unaltered $=-2\%$ alteration.   
• Slight $=2\%{-}10\%$ alteration.   
• Moderate $=>\!10\%{-}50\%$ alteration.   
• $\mathrm{High}=>50\%{-95\%}$ alteration.   
• Complete $=>\!95\%{-}100\%$ alteration.  

# 3.10. Thin section descriptions  

Thin section investigation was used to complement and refine macroscopic core observations fo r igneous rocks. All thin section observations were entered into the LIMS database through  a DESClogik thin section template. Thin section descriptions include both primary (igneous) rockforming minerals (including phenocrysts, groundmass, etc.) and secondary (alteration) minera l phases (in veins, vesicles, groundmass, etc.). Their mineralogy, abundance (modal volume percentages), sizes, shapes, habits, textural relationships, inclusions, alteration (color, intensity, an d style), veins (type and number), and vesicles (type and fillings) were determined, enabling verification of macroscopic observations. When time permitted, the estimated volume percentages of th e original primary mineral phases, groundmass, and vesicles were also included when entering mineral abundances in DESClogik.  

Thin section descriptions include the following information:  

• Sample domain: because thin sections are often taken from intervals that contain more than one lithologic feature, it is necessary in the thin section description log to identify which feature (i.e., domain) is being described. In this case, where there is more than one domain represented in the slide, each domain is described separately. For example, a slide that shows a large secondary vein $25\%$ of the slide) in a basaltic matrix $75\%$ of the slide) is given two descriptions: one being the “vein” and the other the “host rock.” Other possible domains include clast, glass, halo, and xenolith.   
• Lithology prefix modifier and lithology prefix for the described sample domain, following the nomenclature for rock classification described in Rock classification.   
• Principal lithology: refers only to the lithology of the described sample domain and follows the nomenclature for rock classification (see Rock classification).   
• Overall rock texture/crystallinity of the domain described (i.e., holohyaline, holocrystalline, hypohyaline, hypocrystalline).   
• Interpretation of the rock structure/mode of emplacement: pillow lava, sheet flow, massive flow, dike, pyroclastic rock, rubble.   
• Average groundmass grain size modal name following Neuendorf et al. (2005). Note that because of time constraints, groundmass grain sizes were not determined for most thin section descriptions during Expedition 390: • Glassy, • Cryptocrystalline $(<\!0.1\;\mathrm{mm})$ , • Microcrystalline $(0.1{-}0.2\ \mathrm{mm})$ ), • Fine grained $(0.2{-}1\ \mathrm{mm})$ ), • Medium grained $(1{-}2\;\mathrm{mm})$ , • Coarse grained $(>2\;\mathrm{mm})$ ).   
• Maximum and minimum groundmass grain size modal name. Because of time constraints, grain sizes were not determined for most thin section descriptions during Expedition 390.   
• Groundmass texture: intergranular, intersertal, granular, felty, ophitic, subophitic, trachytic, microlitic, graphic, vitrophyric, eutaxitic, skeletal, spherulitic, variolitic, dendritic, fibrous.   
• Mineral phenocryst shape: the dominant $550\%$ of crystals) shape of the olivine, plagioclase, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and spinel crystals in euhedral, subhedral, and anhedral.   
• Mineral phenocryst habit: the dominant $550\%$ of crystals) habit of olivine, plagioclase, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and spinel crystals divided into elongate, equant, subequant, tabular, acicular, dendritic, skeletal, variolitic, spherulitic, sheaf, plumose, and glomeroporphyritic.   
• Plagioclase phenocryst zoning type: continuous, discontinuous, oscillatory, patchy, unzoned.   
• Clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene phenocryst exsolution: blebs, lamellae.   
• Vesicle size, shape, and abundance.   
• Proportion of groundmass phases.   
• Additional features such as dissolution/resorption textures, sieve textures, and inclusions are noted in the comments sections.  

Modal data were visually estimated by reference to standard charts. Crystal sizes were measure d using a micrometer scale; generally, these measurements are more precise than hand-specime n estimates.  

# 3.10.1. Expedition 393 modifications  

Two minor modifications were made for the Expedition 393 thin section igneous petrograph y descriptions, captured on the 393_microscopic template in DESClogik:  

• Where necessary, thin sections were divided into domains based on both primary igneous and secondary alteration criteria. These domain types may coincide spatially but not necessarily. For example, a single igneous domain may be covered by multiple alteration domains, and vice versa. Igneous domains were selected from chilled margin, glassy margin, flow interior, breccia clast, and breccia matrix, and any additional information was provided as a comment. • All thin sections were screened in reflected light for primary and secondary oxide and sulfide minerals, with particular emphasis on locating any primary sulfide blebs in glasses.  

To visually calibrate micro- and macroscopic modal abundance estimates of phenocrysts and vesicles across the hard rock core description team, a digital areal abundance exercise was undertake n following approaches used during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 309/312 an d 327 (Expedition 309/312 Scientists, 2006; Expedition 327 Scientists, 2011). A set of Expedition 39 0 thin sections were selected to cover different abundance ranges. Full page images of the thin sections were printed, and the phenocrysts and vesicles were traced onto an overlay using differen t colors. This overlay was scanned, and using the threshold function in Adobe Photoshop, eac h phase was separated. The area represented by each phase was then determined by using the histogram function, where the number of pixels of each color was divided by the total number of pixel s in the image to calculate a percent abundance of each phase.

# 3.11.1. Expanded depths  

The incomplete recovery of basement cores remains a reality of scientific ocean drilling, and recoveries for individual basement cores ranged from $0\%$ to ${>}90\%$ along the SAT. Immediately afte r recovery, the pieces from each core were curated into bins, each separated by $1{-}2\,\mathrm{cm},$ , starting fro m the top of the core. For cores with near $100\%$ recovery, this spacing may lead to curated lengths i n excess of the drill-advanced length over which that core was cut. In the far more common case o f ${<}100\%$ recovery, the curated length of a core will be less than the drill-advanced length, but th e lower pieces of the core could nevertheless have originated from the bottom of the drill-advance d length. To account for this, curated depths were recalculated to “expanded depths” for certai n applications, such as plotting continuous data downhole (e.g., veins or $\mathtt{p X R F}$ results) and for making a best estimate of the true unit contact depths and thicknesses for visualization in the lithostratigraphic summary figure in each chapter, for eventual comparison with wireline logging data.  

To make this expansion, the curated offset from the top of each core was multiplied by a facto r calculated from the drill-advanced depth/curated recovery for that core and then this expande d offset was added to the top depth of each core to arrive at an expanded depth. This recalculatio n essentially spreads the depths of recovered pieces evenly throughout the drill-advanced interva l over which the core was cut, such that the lowermost pieces will be near the bottom of the drilladvanced interval and the uppermost pieces will be near the top. In the case of a curated lengt h greater than the drill-advanced length, which did not occur during this expedition, this expansio n factor would be $^{<1}$ and would similarly work to compress the pieces into the drill-advanced length.  

# 3.11.2. Curated, expanded, and minimum unit thicknesses  

The curated, expanded, and minimum unit thicknesses are reported in a table in each site chapter. The curated thickness is the difference between the curated depths (on the CSF-A depth scale) o f the upper and lower unit contacts. The expanded thickness is the difference between the upper an d lower contacts expanded to account for variable recovery, as described above, and represents th e best estimate of the true intersected thickness of the unit, most suitable for direct comparison wit h wireline logs and for quantitative treatment of unit thicknesses. The minimum thickness is given b y the sum of the drill-advanced lengths for any cores entirely within a unit, plus the sum of any piec e lengths or recovered sections lengths within a unit for any cores that contain only part of a unit.  

# 4. Alteration petrology  

Virtually all igneous rocks recovered during Expeditions 390C, 395E, 390, and 393 have undergon e alteration. This alteration manifests as replacement of groundmass and phenocrysts, hydrothermal veins and alteration halos, lining and filling of vesicles, and replacement or cementation o f breccia clasts and matrix. Each of these alteration types was described and recorded and combined into a brief summary on the VCD.  

# 4.1. Alteration logs  

Altogether, three separate alteration logs were recorded: (1) an alteration log recording the background alteration and the proportions of different types of halo and patch alteration; (2) a vei n (and other mineral fill) log recording the occurrence and size/area of each individual vein, vei n networks, or areas of vesicles, quantifying their mineral fill and describing any associated halos; and (3) a breccia log recording the occurrence, matrix, and cement of breccias (see DESC_WKB i n Supplementary material). These logs enable quantification of variations in alteration and secondary mineral abundance both downhole and between different holes (Figure F15). The log s were made at slightly different scales; the proportions of different alteration styles were assesse d on a section by section basis, whereas veins and other secondary mineral fills were recorded fo r each vein or each interval or piece of cemented breccia or filled vesicles.  

This approach to logging alteration follows closely that of Integrated Ocean Drilling Progra m Expeditions 301 and 327 (Expedition 301 Scientists, 2005; Expedition 327 Scientists, 2011) and th e Oman Drilling Project (Kelemen et al., 2020) and incorporates elements of the approaches of OD P Leg 206 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2003) and Expeditions 309/312 and 335 (Expedition 309/31 2 Scientists, 2006; Expedition 335 Scientists, 2012a).  

# 4.1.1. Background alteration log  

The overall background alteration log was made to quantify the overall area proportions of different types of background, halo, and patch alteration in the core. Sections were only divided wher e an igneous unit boundary, as defined in the igneous lithology log, was encountered. Alteration wa s logged on the basis of macroscopic color because individual background and halo mineral specie s could rarely be distinguished at this scale. The relative proportions of alteration styles were logge d based on the recovered core (rather than the curated/binned length) and excluded mineral vei n and breccia fillings that were logged separately (see below). In practice, active effort to exclud e such mineral fills was only necessary in areas of extremely abundant vuggy carbonate. Wher e rocks clearly expressed oxidative alteration overprinted by green alteration (in Hole U1557D), thi s was recorded in the alteration logs as a 50:50 mixture of the two alteration types.  

The procedures adopted for macroscopic observation and description of cores was as follows:  

1. Determine the number of igneous units in each section from the igneous log and assign each interval to a record/row in the alteration tab in DESClogik. Log each individual interval (row) following Steps 2–7.   
2. Estimate the proportion by area of each type and color of alteration (e.g., gray background, dark patches, green halos, and red halos).   
3. Estimate alteration intensity in surface area percentage of background alteration: • Fresh/unaltered $=-2\%$ alteration. • Slight $=2\%{-}10\%$ alteration. • Moderate $=>\!10\%{-}50\%$ alteration. • $\mathrm{High}=>\!50\%{-95\%}$ alteration. • Complete $=>\!95\%{-}100\%$ alteration.   
4. Characterize the texture/style of background alteration: • Patchy, • Recrystallized, • Gradational, or • Pseudomorphic.   
5. Assign a color and Munsell color code to each type of alteration.   
6. For patches of alteration, characterize patch size.   
7. Record additional characteristic features of each alteration group in Comments.

# 4.1.2. Vein and mineral fill log  

Detailed logs of vein, vesicles, and breccias were produced, allowing the precise interval of thei r occurrence to be recorded independent of the larger scale alteration log and enabling accurat e quantification and plotting of different mineral occurrences downhole.  

The vein and mineral fill log records the presence, location, width, crosscutting relationships, shape, and composition percent along with color, and width of associated halos of each vein. Th e fill texture, connectivity, and morphology of veins was described. Structural measurements o n veins were not undertaken during Expedition 390.  

A detailed log was made of the relative proportions and abundance of minerals filling void spaces. This principally recorded veins but also included vein networks, vesicles, breccia cements, an d secondary minerals (of indeterminate geometry) in rubble bins. This allowed easy quantificatio n and plotting of the abundance of filling minerals downhole. Using the width and geometry of thes e veins, the area and subsequently volume of each vein was calculated and used to determine th e volume percent of the core filled by secondary minerals in veins (e.g., see Figure F44 in the Sit e U1559 chapter [Coggon et al., 2024b]) normalized for core recovery.  

Filling minerals (and their relative proportions) were assessed based on color, texture, and habi t and confirmed by analysis of thin sections and/or XRD where necessary.  

Halos surrounding veins or vesicles were described by their half-width and color. Secondary mineral assemblages were noted where distinguishable in macroscopic core.  

Features were not logged across pieces to simplify normalizing the abundance of secondary minerals to recovery using the piece log. Continuous occurrences of breccia were logged piece b y piece. In rare cases, a long vein crossing two pieces may have been logged as two veins. Wher e pieces logged for breccia cement (or in the piece log) had tapered or irregular ends, the top an d bottom interval of the piece were chosen to approximate a square end piece of full width core (e.g., for a planar tapered end this would be halfway up the tapered interval).  

For each secondary mineral-filled feature logged, the proportion of the area filled (as opposed t o open void) was also recorded. This allowed the quantification of the open voids/macroporosity a s a proportion of the total rock downhole.  

Each feature was described as following:  

• Filling type: vein, vein net, vesicles, cemented breccia, sediment, rubble.   
• Vein section interval (in centimeters): measured upper and lower intersections with the margin of the split face of the archive half of the core or the greatest upper and lower extent of a vein (Figure F16) and mean perpendicular width. This allows the area percent of specific veins and their mineral fills to be calculated.   
• Other fill type interval: measured upper and lower interval and estimate the total proportion of secondary minerals in the interval resulting in data comparable to veins.   
• Vein generation: if distinguishable, via crosscutting or other relationships.   
• Qualitative vein dip: • Vertical: vein extends across ${<}50\%$ of core width. • Horizontal/moderately inclined/steeply inclined: vein extends across ${>}50\%$ of core width.   
• Vein texture (schematic illustrations of vein textures, connectivity, and morphologies described are provided in Figure F17): massive, cross-fiber (antitaxial), oblique-fiber, vuggy, polycrystalline, crack-seal (syntaxial), crack-seal (stretching), sheared, patchy, overgrowth, cemented breccia (hydrothermal, tectonic).   
• Vein connectivity: Isolated, single, branched, network, en echelon, crosscutting, ribbon, parallel, anastomosing, overlapping.   
• Vein morphology: planar, curved, irregular, vein tip, tension gash, cemented fault breccia.   
• Fill color and Munsell color code (Expedition 390 only).   
• Estimated relative abundance of each secondary mineral: including clay, carbonate, zeolite, Fe oxyhydroxides, other clay, green clay, sulfides, amorphous silica, quartz, and chlorite; for Expedition 393: unknown 1, unknown 2, and unknown 3 were used primarily for variations in sediment fill).   
• XRD results, if any, for comparison.   
• Orientation of major veins (Expedition 393 only; see Structures below for core reference frame [CRF]).   
• Associated halo half-width: if halo is zoned, use width 1 (and color 1, etc.) for the inner zone and width 2 for the outer zone.   
• Assign color and Munsell color code to halo/zones.   
• Pyrite fronts associated with the halo.   
• Further details as comments.

# 4.1.3. Breccia log  

Breccias were recorded separately to allow, among other things, detailed characterization of eac h clast type, matrix, and cement. This was carried out collaboratively between the igneous and alteration petrologists, and the method is described in Igneous petrology. Where breccias wer e encountered, they were first logged in detail and then a piece-by-piece estimate of secondary mineral abundances in the breccia cement was made in the vein_halos_fill log. This enables downhol e quantification of secondary minerals in a consistent way for veins, vesicles, and breccias, wherea s the breccia log allows other relevant details to be recorded.  

# 4.1.4. Piece log  

The length and, if less than $5.7\;\mathrm{cm}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , width of each recovered piece of hard rock core was logged t o calculate the cut surface area of the core to normalize the results of vein and alteration logging t o recovery within each section and thereby accurately quantify the volume proportion of altere d rock and secondary minerals within the core (see Figure F18).  

The curated length is usually slightly longer than the true piece length because there must be som e room left to allow the removal and inspection of core pieces. These gaps may be up to a few centimeters, which may be significant for shorter pieces of core and when core recovery is low.  

To produce the piece log, curated details of the core, including upper and lower curated bin depth s in the core, were exported. Within each bin, the core piece(s) were pushed to the top of the bin an d their lower interval in the core was measured. The piece length was calculated from the differenc e between the top bin interval and the bottom piece interval measured. The piece logs are availabl e in ALTPET in Supplementary material.  

![](images/c9f0aba1e613b6084ca9d2d04e35888c40cc1f88581b053e1272476c6e38227d.jpg)

Cor e pieces are pushed to top of their respective bins in core liner, and their bottom interval in core is read off. Differenc e between this and curated top interval (measured from the bin) gives piece length.  

# 4.2. Thin sections  

To complement and refine macroscopic descriptions of the alteration and structural features o f the core, thin sections of igneous rocks were studied in transmitted and reflected polarizing ligh t microscopy. Thin section samples were selected typically once per igneous unit, often coinciden t with a bulk geochemistry sample, and generally positioned to include multiple features of interest.  

Alteration was characterized in thin section by division of the sample into one or more alteratio n domains (e.g., background, vein, or halo; see Figure F19) and listing the secondary minerals identified in each, together with their estimated abundance and what features of the rock they replace d or filled. During Expedition 390 when only one alteration petrologist was able to sail, only a freetext summary description was produced and included in the thin section reports in the visual cor e descriptions.  

Thin section descriptions are included in Core descriptions and are also available from the LIM S database. Digital photomicrographs were taken during the expedition to document feature s described in the thin sections; these can be obtained from the IODP data librarian.  

# 4.3. Structures  

This section outlines the techniques used for macroscopic and microscopic description of structural features observed in hard rock basement cores. Conventions for structural studies established during previous hard rock drilling expeditions (e.g., ODP Legs 118, 140, 147, 148, 153, 176, 206, and 209; Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 304/305 and 335; IODP Expedition s 357 and 360; and the Oman Drilling Project) were generally followed during Expedition 393, bu t these descriptions were not undertaken during Expedition 390 because of a lack of personnel.  

All material from both working and archive halves was examined. The most representative structural features in the cores recovered during Expeditions 390 and 393 are summarized on the VC D form (see Hard rock visual core descriptions).  

# 4.4. X-ray diffraction analysis  

To refine identification of secondary alteration minerals, selected veins, vesicles, and brecci a cement minerals were analyzed by XRD. Minerals were separated from the working half of th e core using a stainless steel spatula or a dremel tool to abrade or chip off small $({\sim}10{-}50~\mathrm{mg})$ samples with minimal damage to the core. In addition, whole-rock geochemistry powders (see Geochemistry) were also analyzed by XRD.  

Samples for XRD analysis were freeze-dried for $12~\mathrm{{h}}$ prior to being crushed and powdered usin g an agate mortar and pestle. Diffraction data were generated on the shipboard Bruker D4 Endeavo r X-ray diffractometer, which is equipped with a Cu source and uses a generator voltage of $35~\mathrm{kV}$ and current of $40\;\mathrm{mA}$ . Depending on the rate of core recovery and scientific objectives, the XR D operated under two different protocols. For routine analyses to aid core description and delive r essentially qualitative analyses, the operating conditions were set to step scans of $4^{\circ}{-}75^{\circ}26$ fo r 3750 steps at a rate of 1 s/step (the typical setting used on the ship during previous expeditions). For high-precision XRD analyses capable of quantitative analysis via Rietveld-based full-patter n fitting techniques using small amounts of sample, acquisition occurred at step scans of $4^{\circ}{-}120^{\circ}2\theta$ for 5800 steps at a rate of 2 s/step. Diffraction results were evaluated against powder diffractio n files for a large database of natural and synthetic minerals using the HighScore software package. The results of this evaluation included matched mineral species (see XRD files in ALTPET in Supplementary material).

# 4.5. Expedition 393 alteration petrology  

During Expedition 393, the same observations were made and recorded using DESClogik as thos e made during Expedition 390 to allow for comparability along the SAT. The data were captured i n the following DESClogik templates: 393_macroscopic and 393_microscopic. To ensure efficienc y of core flow, the sequence in which observations were made was slightly modified and some additional observations made. These changes are set out below.  

# 4.5.1. Alteration description  

During Expedition 390, an alteration type designated as “mottled gray area%” was used to describ e a characteristic alteration style associated with chilled margins. During Expedition 393, this wa s clarified in DESClogik to “Chilled margin mottled gray area $\%^{n}$ and was counted toward the proportion of background alteration rather than as its own category of alteration. In addition to estimating the area percentage represented by different alteration types (as identified by dominan t color and appearance), during Expedition 393 the intensity of alteration (expressed as percen t alteration) was also estimated for each alteration type. These estimations were calibrated agains t thin section observations and are generally correlated with color intensity, where the more intens e colors are associated with higher degrees of alteration. The inclusion of this estimation allows th e total alteration percentage to be weighted by the proportion and intensity of the different alteratio n types. During Expedition 390, alteration intensity was estimated only for background alteration.  

Modifications to the observation sequence were made in relation to the logging of veins-halosfills. During Expedition 393, these observations were separated into veins-halos and vesicle-othe r fills with breccia cement fills moved to the Breccias tab. These are mechanical changes to aid th e description core flow and do not reflect changes in what was observed and recorded.  

# 4.5.2. Thin section description  

The following additions and clarifications were added for the Expedition 393 thin section alteration petrography descriptions captured in the 393_microscopic template in DESClogik:  

• Where necessary, thin sections were divided into domains based on both primary igneous and secondary alteration criteria. These two domain types may coincide spatially but not necessarily. For example, a single igneous domain may be covered by multiple alteration domains and vice versa. Alteration domains were selected from “background,” “vein halo,” and “other halo,” and any additional information was provided as a description.   
• Vesicle fill and veins were also described on separate tabs in the 393_microscopic template that are slightly modified from the macroscopic versions of these tabs. New to the microscopic template is the specific recording of the sequence of fills in the fill sequence column. This column has a standard format of reporting minerals from rim to center (e.g., a vein lined with brown clay and filled with carbonate would be listed as brown clay–carbonate).   
• Breccia cements were described in the vesicle tab.  

# 4.5.3. Structure description  

The orientation of veins (width $>0.1\ \mathrm{mm}$ ) were measured by the Expedition 393 hard rock cor e description team. These methods follow conventions for structural studies established during previous hard rock drilling projects (e.g., Legs 118, 140, 147, 148, 153, 176, 206, and 209; Expedition s 304/305, 335, 357, and 360; and the Oman Drilling Project).

If piece i s cut perpendicular to strike of feature, dip angle and dip direction can be measured directly. If structural feature is oblique t o cut face, two separate measurements must be made. Figure adapted from Kelemen et al. (2020).  

# 4.5.3.1. Core reference frame  

Measurements of vein-related structural features were undertaken on the archive-half cores i n accordance to the standard IODP core reference frame (CRF) (Figure F20). The plane normal t o the axis of the borehole is referred to as the horizontal plane. On this plane, a $360^{\circ}$ net is used wit h a pseudosouth $(180^{\circ})$ pointing into the archive half and a pseudonorth $(0^{\circ})$ pointing out of th e archive half and perpendicular to the cut surface of the core. The cut surface of the core, therefore, is a vertical plane striking $90^{\circ}{-}270^{\circ}$ . Apparent dip angles $(0^{\circ}{-}90^{\circ})$ and dip direction $(0^{\circ}{-}360^{\circ})$ o f planar structures were measured on the split cores. True dip angles and dip directions wer e obtained from a second apparent dip angle and dip direction measurement and calculated using  a macro in Microsoft Excel (Oman Drilling Project [Kelemen et al., 2020]).  

# 4.5.4. X-ray diffraction  

Whole-rock powders and picked mineral separates were analyzed for their mineralogical composition by powder XRD following the same analytical protocol as that detailed for Expedition 390. Mineralogical compositions were determined by semiquantitative, standardless Rietveld analysi s using Panalytical HighScore Plus software and both the Panalytical Example Database and PDF4/Axiom 2019 database.  

The background of the XRD spectra was first fitted in the software using a bending factor selecte d by the user to preserve all measured peaks. Peak positions were then automatically located by th e software, with the minimum significance defined by the user for each spectrum such that al l detected peaks were recognized. Library mineral diffraction patterns that matched the measure d data were then searched in three steps prior to Rietveld analysis. Firstly, a broad pass search of al l minerals in the database identified the dominant mineral phases. Multiple possible patterns fo r different mineral solid solutions were added to the pattern list at this stage. Secondly, a restricte d search was made of just clay family minerals. Thirdly, a restricted search was made of just zeolit e family minerals. From the clay and zeolite family searches, any minerals that had a reasonable possibility of being present in oceanic crust and scored a match were added to the pattern list. Rietveld fitting analysis then reduced this large list of possible minerals and mineral solid solution s down to a best-fit set of minerals and estimated abundances that could explain all the diffractio n peaks. This multistep pattern search was found to better locate potential matches for lowabundance secondary clay and zeolite phases recognized but not exactly identified by thin sectio n petrography.  

# 5. Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossils (also called calcareous nannoplankton) and planktic foraminifera wer e examined to provide preliminary age constraints for recovered sediment, and benthic foraminifer a were analyzed to provide preliminary estimates of paleodepth. Biostratigraphic and paleodept h analyses were performed on the core catcher (CC) samples, and additional samples were take n from split sections as needed to further refine the stratigraphic position of key datums.  

Core catcher samples from Expeditions 390C and 395E (Holes U1556A, U1557B, U1558A, U1559A, U1560A, and U1561A) were sent to the Expedition 390/393 paleontologists for shorebased analyses at their home institutions. Only the archive halves of these cores were made available on JOIDES Resolution during Expeditions 390 and 393, so no additional section samples wer e available for planktic or benthic foraminiferal analyses. However, additional calcareous nannoplankton smear slide samples were taken from the archive halves to refine the age model at critica l intervals. Whole-round cores spanning the sediment/basement interface from Holes U1556A, U1557B, and U1559A were split shipboard during Expedition 390, and whole-round cores spanning the sediment/basement interface from Holes U1558F, U1583C, and U1560C were split shipboard during Expedition 393. These cores were sampled for both calcareous nannoplankton an d planktic foraminifera as needed (at least one sample per section) to determine the age of th e sediment/basement interface. Thin section samples from indurated calcareous sediments in basement rocks were taken as needed (generally one or two samples per site) for planktic foraminifera l biostratigraphy of interflow sediments.  

Biostratigraphic age assignments were based on identification of calcareous nannoplankton an d planktic foraminiferal lowest occurrences (base [B]) and highest occurrences (top [T]). Biozon e boundaries were placed at the midpoint between the sample containing the marker species an d the sample below (for lowest occurrences) or above (for highest occurrences) without the marke r species. The ages of the calcareous nannoplankton and planktic foraminiferal biozonatio n schemes used during Expedition 390/393 followed Gradstein et al. (2020) as modified by King e t al. (2020) for Neogene planktic foraminifera. Calcareous nannoplankton and planktic foraminiferal biozone marker species and other useful biostratigraphic datums are illustrated in Figur e F21.  

Calcareous nannoplankton and foraminiferal occurrences, preservation, abundance, and zona l assignments were entered into the LIMS database using the DESClogik software package, with th e exception of benthic foraminifera for Site U1557, which samples were analyzed at the end of Expedition 390/393. Biostratigraphic data are reported in tables summarizing recorded datums, distribution charts, qualitative abundance plots, and preservation summaries for each site. Bot h onshore analysis of Expeditions 390C and 395E core catchers and shipboard Expedition 390/39 3 biostratigraphic analyses largely focused on the presence of age- and depth-diagnostic species, an d therefore distribution data do not represent the complete microfossil assemblage. Qualitativ e notes about the overall abundance and preservation state were made for calcareous nannoplankton and planktic and benthic foraminifera in each sample analyzed. Observations regardin g other notable sedimentary material (e.g., fish teeth, echinoderm spines, and diatoms) were als o included.  

# 5.1. Calcareous nannofossils  

# 5.1.1. Calcareous nannofossil taxonomy and biostratigraphy  

Nannofossil taxonomy primarily follows Bown (1998, 2005) and Perch-Nielsen (1985) as compile d in the online database Nannotax3 (Young et al., 2022). The zonal scheme of Martini (1971) (zona l code numbers NP and NN) were used for Cenozoic calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy. Additional biohorizons from the Paleogene scheme of Agnini et al. (2014) (zonal code numbers CNP, CNE, and CNO) and the Neogene/Quaternary scheme of Backman et al. (2012) (zone number s CNM and CNPL) are also included. The compilation of Raffi et al. (2006) was also partially used t o provide additional information on the reliability, definition, and timing of Quaternary bioevents. These zonations represent a general framework for the biostratigraphic classification of middle- t o low-latitude nannofossil assemblages and are presented in Figure F21.  

The genus Gephyrocapsa dominates Pleistocene assemblages. However, this group demonstrate s a large range of variation in size and morphology, which causes problems in identification (e.g., Samtleben, 1980; Su, 1996; Bollmann, 1997). Size variations in Gephyrocapsa spp. are commonl y used as biostratigraphic markers in the Pleistocene, and several studies confirm the reliability o f these biometric subdivisions as biostratigraphic markers (e.g., Raffi et al., 1993, 2006; Young, 1998; Raffi, 2002; Lourens et al., 2004; Maiorano and Marino, 2004). We elected to use this biometric classification with the following divisions applied for shipboard identification of Gephyrocapsa:

Figure F21. Microfossil datums used during Expeditions 390C, 395E, 390, and 393 with calcareous nannoplankton and planktic foraminiferal zonation schemes fo r most of Cenozoic (from Danian to recent). $\mathsf{L C O=}$ last common occurrence, ${\mathsf{S}}{\mathsf{-D}}=$ sinistral–dextral, $\mathsf{F C O=}$ first common occurrence, $\mathsf{X}=$ abundance crossover.  

• Gephyrocapsa spp. ${<}4\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ (small): includes a number of different species (e.g., Gephyrocapsa ericsonii and Gephyrocapsa ornata, as well as small specimens of Gephyrocapsa oceanica and Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica). Zones NN21–NN19/CNPL11–CNPL8.   
• Medium-sized Gephyrocapsa $(4-5.5\;\upmu\mathrm{m})$ were identified to species level based on the size and morphology of the central area: $G.$ . oceanica (large central area with bridge angle ${\bf<}90^{\circ}$ to the minor axis) and $G.$ . caribbeanica (small central area nearly filled by a bridge). Gephyrocapsa omega and Gephyrocapsa muellerae were included with G. oceanica. Zones NN21–NN19/CNPL11–CNPL8. This was only done during Expedition 390.   
• Gephyrocapsa spp. ${>}5.5\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ (large) includes large specimens of both G. oceanica and G. caribbeanica. Zones NN19/CNPL8.  

The genus Reticulofenestra dominates most early Eocene to Neogene nannofossil assemblages. One of this taxon’s distinguishing features is the central area grill or net. However, this feature i s not always preserved or is not birefringent, making identification difficult. As a result, species ar e often differentiated based on rim shape and lith size (e.g., Backman, 1980; Su, 1996; Young, 1998). Large variations in size ranges of coccoliths exist, and whereas some species are more easily distinguishable, elliptical forms are particularly problematic, especially since different names have bee n applied to similar morphologies from the Paleogene and Neogene. For the SAT cores, we define d the taxonomy applied for members of this genus as follows:  

Elliptical forms $<\!3\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$  

• Reticulofenestra minuta: all elliptical forms $<\!3\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ with variable central opening size.  

Elliptical forms $>\!3\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ with open central area:  

• Reticulofenestra haqii: open central area $3{-}5\ {\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ in length.   
• Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus: Neogene sediments; divided into two size categories following the definition of Young (1998) for biostratigraphic utility: • Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus $(5-7\;\upmu\mathrm{m})$ . • Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus $(>\!7\;\upmu\mathrm{m})$ for Miocene–early Pliocene (Zones NN15– NN1/CNPL3–CNM1).   
• Reticulofenestra dictyoda: open central area $5{-}14\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ (Paleogene sediments).   
• Reticulofenestra umbilicus: ${>}14\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ with open central area.  

Elliptical forms $>\!3\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ with closed central area:  

• Reticulofenestra producta: closed central area $3{-}5\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ in length.   
• Reticulofenestra perplexa: closed central area $5{-}8\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ in length.   
• Reticulofenestra bisecta: closed central area $8{-}10\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ in length.   
• Reticulofenestra stavensis: closed central area ${>}10\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ in length.  

# 5.1.2. Methods of calcareous nannofossil study  

Calcareous nannoplankton were examined on smear slides using standard preparation technique s (Bown and Young, 1998); at least one sample was analyzed per core. When necessary, additiona l smear slide samples were taken between core catcher samples to refine the stratigraphic positio n of biohorizons. Samples were analyzed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with cross-polarized, plane-transmitted, and/or phase-contrast light at $630\times$ or $1000\times$ magnification; abundance estimates were made at $1000\times$ magnification. All light microscope images were taken using a Spo t RTS system with the IODP Image Capture and Spot commercial software.  

# All light microscope images were uploaded to the LIMS database.  

Total calcareous nannofossil group abundance in the sediment was recorded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $550\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $C=$ common $(>\!10\%{-}50\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ few $\scriptstyle\left(1\%-10\%\right.$ of sediment particles).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(\!\!\!\!\!-1\%\!\!\!\!)$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{B}=$ barren (no specimens).  

Individual calcareous nannofossil taxa abundance was recorded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $_{>10-100}$ specimens per field of view [FOV]).   
• $C=$ common $(>\!1-\!10$ specimens per FOV).   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ few (1 specimen per $1{-}10\,\mathrm{FOV})$ .   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1 specimen per $10\,\mathrm{FOV}$ ).   
• ${\mathrm{VR}}=$ very rare $_{<5}$ specimens seen while logging slide).   
• $?=$ questionable occurrence.   
• rw $=$ reworked occurrence.  

Calcareous nannofossil preservation was recorded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{G}=\mathtt{g o o d}$ (little or no evidence of dissolution or recrystallization, primary morphological characteristics only slightly altered, and specimens identifiable to the species level). • $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (specimens exhibit some etching or recrystallization, primary morphological characteristics somewhat altered, and most specimens identifiable at species level). • $\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbf{r}$ (specimens were severely etched or overgrown, primary morphological characteristics largely destroyed, fragmentation had occurred, and specimens often could not be identified at the species or genus level).  

# 5.2. Foraminifera  

# 5.2.1. Planktic foraminifera taxonomy and biostratigraphy  

Taxonomic concepts of planktic foraminifera follow Saito et al. (1981), Olsson et al. (1999), Pearson et al. (2006), Wade et al. (2018), Kennett and Srinivasan (1983), and Lam and Leckie (2020a), as  well  as  genus-specific  publications  (e.g.,  Fabbrini  et  al.,  2021)  and  references  o n pforams@mikrotax (Huber et al., 2016; Young et al., 2017). Identification of planktic foraminifer a in thin sections followed Postuma (1971).  

Planktic foraminiferal biostratigraphy follows the Cenozoic zonation scheme of Wade et al. (2011 ) incorporating the Neogene updates of King et al. (2020). Age estimates for planktic foraminifera l datums follow King et al. (2020) for the Neogene and Gradstein et al. (2020) elsewhere. Plankti c foraminiferal range charts developed from Deep Sea Drilling Program Leg 73 and 72 sites (Poore, 1984; Berggren et al., 1983) drilled in the South Atlantic were also used to help determine ag e during Expedition 393 because several primary and secondary datums used in the tropical– subtropical zonation schemes of Wade et al. (2011) and King et al. (2020) were missing at som e sites and diachroneity is known to occur in Pacific Ocean mid-latitude sites (Lam and Leckie, 2020b; Lam et al., 2022).  

# 5.2.2. Benthic foraminifera taxonomy and paleodepth estimates  

Benthic foraminiferal taxonomy and depth distribution follow Boersma (1984), Holbourn et al. (2013), Katz et al. (2003), Miller (1983), Tjalsma (1983), Tjalsma and Lohmann (1983), and Va n Morkhoven et al. (1986). When necessary, benthic foraminifera identification was refined by usin g the images on https://foraminifera.eu (Hesemann, 2020).  

For paleodepth estimates, the schemes by Van Morkhoven et al. (1986) and Berggren and Mille r (1989) were used. Specifically, paleodepths were categorized as follows:  

• Neritic $=-200$ meters below sea level (mbsl).   
• Bathyal $=200{-}2000\,\mathrm{mbsl}$ . • Upper bathyal $=200{-}600\,\mathrm{mbs}$ l. • Middle bathyal $=600–1000$ mbsl. • Lower bathyal $=1000{-}2000\,\mathrm{mbs}$ l.  

• Abyssal $=>\!2000$ mbsl. • Upper abyssal $=2000{-}3000\;\mathrm{mbsl.}$ • Lower abyssal $=>\!3000$ mbsl.  

# 5.2.3. Methods of study for foraminifera  

# 5.2.3.1. Washed residues  

Samples collected during Expeditions 390C and 395E were washed on shore following establishe d protocols. Soft-sediment samples were washed over a $63~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ sieve; indurated sediment sample s were soaked in deionized water and, if necessary, in a $10\%$ solution of hydrogen peroxide for a t least $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ and then washed with tap water over a $63\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ sieve. Sieved residues were then dried in a n oven before examination. Samples collected during Expedition 390/393 were processed in th e same way, although sieved residues were air-dried in a fume hood during Expedition 393. Sieve s were thoroughly cleaned and visually inspected between samples to prevent contamination. During Expedition 393, sieves were also soaked in methylene blue dye between samples to fla g contamination. All samples were examined using a stereomicroscope equipped with an externa l light source.  

Identification of biostratigraphically significant planktic foraminiferal species was primarily conducted on the ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fractions. The $63{-}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction was analyzed as needed. Identification of benthic foraminiferal species for paleodepth estimates was based on the $>\!250$ an d ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fractions.  

The relative abundance of both planktic and benthic foraminifera (defined as group abundance o n the datum tables) relative to the total sieved residue was estimated based on the following criteria:  

• $\mathbf{D}=$ dominant ( $530\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!20\%{-}30\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $C=$ common $(>\!10\%{-}20\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ few $(>\!5\%{-}10\%$ of sediment particles).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(>\!1\%-5\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{P}=$ present $1\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{B}=$ barren.  

We define sediment particles as including fragmented microfossil tests and broken planktic foraminiferal tests with more than $50\%$ of the shell preserved. Abundance estimates were predominantly based on inspections from the ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction for planktic foraminifera and from th e $>\!250$ and ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fractions for benthic foraminifera.  

Specimens that were clearly reworked during Expedition 390 were noted in the Comments column on the distribution tables. During Expedition 393, reworked species were noted on the table s under the Species column as “rw.” Questionable occurrences were marked with a question mark. Occurrences of species that do not match the sensu stricto species concept but that clearly have a n affinity for that species were designated as “aff.” When poor preservation made taxonomic identification ambiguous, specimens were designated as “cf.” The preservation status of planktic an d benthic foraminifera was estimated using the following criteria:  

• $\mathsf{E}=$ excellent (glassy preservation).   
• $\mathrm{VG}=$ very good (no evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $\mathbf{G}=$ good (little evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (calcite overgrowth, dissolution, and/or abrasion are common but minor).   
• $\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbf{r}$ (substantial overgrowth, dissolution, and/or fragmentation).   
• ${\mathrm{VP}}=$ very poor (foraminifera are present but cannot be speciated).  

Benthic foraminiferal preservation was assessed also considering the recent revision of preservation by Poirier et al. (2021), which is based on the identification of three main preservation state s (glassy, pseudoglassy, and frosty). Thus, the above criteria were assigned to benthic foraminifera i n the context of the Poirier et al. (2021) classification as follows:  

• $\mathsf{E}=$ excellent (glassy preservation); glassy according to Poirier et al. (2021).   
• $\mathrm{VG}=$ very good (no evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion); glassy/pseudoglassy according to Poirier et al. (2021). The possible presence of visual whitening, particularly along the suture, was considered a diagnostic feature for VG specimens.   
• $\mathrm{G}=\mathtt{g o o d}$ (little evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion); pseudoglassy according to Poirier et al. (2021). The presence of some visual whitening, particularly along the suture, was considered a diagnostic feature for G specimens.   
• $M=$ moderate (calcite overgrowth, dissolution, and/or abrasion are common but minor); pseudoglassy/frosty according to Poirier et al. (2021). Substantial whitening throughout the test was considered a diagnostic feature for M specimens.   
• $\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbf{r}$ (substantial overgrowth, dissolution, and/or fragmentation); frosty according to Poirier et al. (2021). Poorly preserved benthic specimens are completely opaque with the possible presence of shiny luster.   
• ${\mathrm{VP}}=$ very poor; frosty according to Poirier et al. (2021). Very poorly preserved benthic specimens are completely opaque with a distinct matte luster but still identifiable.  

# 5.2.3.2. Thin sections  

Thin sections of lithified sediments from the basement were analyzed when these sediments wer e sufficiently thick to indicate the likely presence of microfossils. Thin sections were prepare d shipboard using standard techniques (see Igneous petrology). Samples were analyzed for agediagnostic taxa following the thin section identification guide of Postuma (1971).  

# 5.2.3.3. Imaging  

Age-diagnostic planktic foraminifera, as well as other notable specimens, were imaged using th e Hitachi TM3000 Bench Top SEM on JOIDES Resolution and illustrated as part of each site chapte r where appropriate. To aid in future sampling for geochemical proxies, foraminiferal preservatio n in representative samples from different time intervals (Neogene, Oligocene, Eocene, and Paleocene) was assessed using the SEM during Expedition 390. At least one planktic and one benthi c foraminiferal species typically used for proxy analysis in each time interval were selected an d imaged on the SEM without sputter coating. Specimens were then gently broken with a needle o n the SEM stub and returned to the SEM for imaging of the interior wall texture and chamber infilling (when present). All SEM images were uploaded to the LIMS database.  

# 6. Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic investigations carried out during Expeditions 390C, 395E, 390, and 393 examine d both sediment and igneous basement cores recovered from Sites U1556–U1561 and U1583. Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) measurement of the sediment archive halves before and afte r AF demagnetization gave a magnetic polarity stratigraphy for each site. These records could the n be correlated, with guidance from biostratigraphic constraints, to the geomagnetic polarity timescale. The remanence behavior of basement cores was studied to characterize the magnetic signatures of different volcanic units and the effects of alteration.  

Stepwise full AF and thermal demagnetization of discrete samples, including both sediment an d hard rock material, was used to determine the sediment geomagnetic polarity sequence and th e polarity of the basement rocks. In the basement sections at each site, discrete samples were primarily located in the least-altered portion of each magmatic unit to investigate both the remanence and the dominant magnetic carrier of successive lava flows. Supplementary samples wer e taken from representative intervals of progressively altered basalts to investigate the effects o f hydrothermal alteration across the aging ocean crust on a range of rock magnetic properties. Fo r sediment cores collected and measured during Expeditions 390C and 395E, only the archive-hal f cores were available for analysis during Expeditions 390 and 393. Consequently, no discret e samples were taken from those cores, except for hitherto unsplit cores directly at the sediment/ basement interface. Discrete samples were taken from sediment cores collected during Expeditions 390 and 393 to support polarity interpretations and help characterize the magnetic mineralogy.  

# 6.1. Sample coordinates, core orientation, and drilling operations  

The coordinate systems used for archive halves and discrete samples follow IODP protocol and ar e shown in Figure F22. Nonmagnetic stainless steel core barrels employed during APC and RC B coring reduced the drill string overprint (Lund et al., 2003). The Icefield MI-5 core orientation too l was deployed during collection of most APC cores for the purpose of core orientation. By providing an azimuthal correction, NRM declinations could be transformed into true geographic coordinates. However, there were instances where the tool was not deployed or the tool provide d ambiguous results. Paleomagnetic measurements made on RCB cores were unoriented because o f rotation of the outer core barrel. Because XCB coring requires rotation of both the inner and oute r core barrels, XCB cores were neither oriented nor drilled with nonmagnetic core barrels, an d those impacts must be accounted for during data processing.  

# 6.2. Archive-half measurements  

Measurements of NRM and partial stepwise AF demagnetization at steps of 5, 10, and $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ carried out on archive halves (Figure F22A) used a 2G Enterprises Model 760R-4K superconductin g rock magnetometer (SRM). Noise levels of the SRM, established from empty core tray measurements during transits at the start of Expeditions 390 and 393, were $\leq5\,\times\,10^{-8}\ \mathrm{Am^{2}}$ for the thre e superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) sensors. Both the $x\cdot$ - and $z$ -axis wer e found to be the noisiest, and the $y$ -axis was the cleanest. The SRM is driven by the Integrate d Measurement System (IMS) SRM software (Version 12.0) and is equipped with direct-curren t SQUIDs (DC-SQUIDs) and in-line 3-axis orthogonal coils for AF demagnetization that can reac h peak fields of $80\;\mathrm{mT}$ . The SRM SQUID sensors have a spatial resolution of ${\sim}8\;\mathrm{cm}$ , determined b y the width at half height of the response of the pickup coils. Measurements made within ${\sim}4\;\mathrm{cm}$ o f gaps in the core material or core section breaks will thus be affected by edge effects and wer e treated with caution. Sediment and hard rock archive halves were measured at $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ spacing.  

Measurement of the igneous basement depended on recovery and signal intensity. SRM measurements on archive-half core sections were done only when recovery was good and pieces were lon g enough $\left(\geq\!9\,\mathsf{c m}\right)$ to avoid edge effects. In cases where we obtained spurious results on the SRM du e to strongly magnetized materials generating residual flux counts, the measuring resolution wa s lowered to $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ . If this too gave spurious results or when recovery was poor and pieces were to o short to analyze, we instead solely measured discrete samples.

To avoid potential magnetic contamination, the sample track was cleaned each day, both physically and magnetically, at an AF of $60\,\mathrm{mT}$ . Prior to and following measurement of each archive-hal f section, a portion of empty track $\left(6\;\mathrm{cm}\right)$ was measured. These are referred to as the header an d trailer measurements and serve the dual functions of monitoring the background magneti c moment and allowing for future deconvolution analysis.  

# 6.3. Discrete samples  

# 6.3.1. Paleomagnetic measurements  

An AGICO JR-6A dual-speed spinner magnetometer (sensitivity $=\sim2\times10^{-6}\ \mathrm{A/m})$ was used t o measure the NRM before and after demagnetization (AF or thermal) of all discrete samples collected (Figure F22B).  

In relatively undisturbed and continuous soft sediment, we collected two samples per core. Fo r disturbed cores, sampling resolution was dependent on available material. These sediments wer e collected in $7~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ plastic Natsuraha-Giken sampling boxes (J-cubes; Figure F22C). In all cases , samples were extracted from the middle of the working half of the core with the arrow on the fac e of the J-cube pointing upcore (Figure F22).  

Discrete sample cubes $(8\;\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ ) of lithified sediments and hard rock material were removed with  a tile saw equipped with two parallel blades. Although minicores $\mathrm{\sqrt{\sim}12~c m^{3}}$ cylinders of rock) ar e more commonly used in paleomagnetic laboratories, cubes are preferred here because they have  a more reproducible vertical reference and facilitate sample sharing for paleomagnetic and physica l properties analyses. An orientation arrow was drawn directly on the cube face (Figure F22C). These samples were used for both AF and thermal demagnetization experiments.  

Similarly to the SRM analysis of hard rock core archive-half sections, discrete sampling of the har d rock working-half sections was determined by recovery and the nature of the material recovered. In cores where recovery was good, discrete samples for shipboard analysis were selected on th e basis of identified flow/magmatic unit boundaries (see Igneous petrology), targeting the freshes t available representative material, typically two samples per core. In a subset of the magmatic units, an additional discrete sample representative of the unit’s hydrothermal alteration was taken t o assess the effects of hydrothermal alteration on the magnetic properties of the rocks.  

We performed progressive AF demagnetization of discrete samples using a DTech D-2000 A F demagnetizer. Following NRM measurement, we used one of two primary demagnetizatio n schemes (Table T4). Sequence Main I used $5~\mathrm{mT}$ steps up to $40\;\mathrm{mT}_{1}$ $10\;\mathrm{mT}$ steps between 40 an d $60\;\mathrm{mT},$ and $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ steps up to $100\;\mathrm{mT}$ . Sequence Main II was a condensed form of Sequence Mai n I and consisted of $10\,\mathrm{mT}$ steps starting at $5\,\mathrm{mT}$ up to $25\,\mathrm{mT}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , a single $5\,\mathrm{mT}$ step up to $30\,\mathrm{mT}$ , a singl e $10\:\mathrm{mT}$ step up to $40\;\mathrm{mT}_{\mathrm{i}}$ and $20\,\mathrm{mT}$ steps up to $100\;\mathrm{mT}$ . If a characteristic remanent magnetizatio n (ChRM) had not yet been identified or a significant drop in intensity not observed by $100\;\mathrm{mT},$ w e carried out additional AF demagnetization in $30~\mathrm{{mT}}$ steps until we achieved either result. Variations of these two sequences (i.e., skipped steps) were also used when (1) time was a factor, (2) initial demagnetization data indicated that such long sequences were not necessary (i.e.,  a straight line to the origin was isolated early on), or (3) results from similar rock types previousl y measured suggested detailed demagnetizations were not necessary.

Where possible in basement cores, paleomagnetic and physical properties analyses were conducted on shared samples to allow comparison of these properties in a given rock to provide semiquantitative assessment of the effects of alteration. This also reduced the amount of sampl e material required in intervals of low recovery. When samples were shared, AF and thermal demagnetization experiments (using an ASC Scientific TD-48 thermal demagnetizer) for hard roc k material occurred prior to and following MAD measurements, respectively (see Physical properties and downhole measurements). MAD measurements required saturating samples with wate r and then drying them at $105\mathrm{^\circC}$ for ${\sim}24\mathrm{~h~}$ in a magnetically unshielded environment. In thes e instances, NRM was measured before and after the MAD measurements. The sample was the n demagnetized at $110^{\circ}C$ to remove any viscous magnetization acquired during the MAD measurements, followed by demagnetization at $150^{\circ}C$ . Subsequent demagnetization occurred at $50^{\circ}$ step s up to $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , $25^{\circ}$ steps up to $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , and $40^{\circ}$ steps thereafter up to $580^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Samples were heated fo r $30\;\mathrm{min}$ and then cooled to room temperature before measuring. Because of time constraints, thermal demagnetization experiments were performed only on every fifth core. Additionally, we calculated the median destructive field (MDF; from AF demagnetization) and median destructiv e temperature (MDT; thermal demagnetization) of our discrete samples. This is the field and temperature, respectively, where $50\%$ of the NRM is reduced. This further aids in both mineralogica l and grain size analyses.  

During Expedition 393, a magnetic shield casing (Figure F23) was built for discrete hard rock samples that were being shared for MAD analyses to prevent samples from acquiring artificial viscou s overprints while allowing for faster processing of the shared samples. This also reduced the overal l number of samples taken from the hard rock cores. The shield casing contained three concentri c layers of wood, each covered with $\upmu.$ -metal foil. The seams in the wood and foil of each layer wer e rotated to different positions to avoid leakage of magnetic fields into the shielding.  

Measurements of NRM before and after each demagnetization step were plotted as orthogona l vector plots (OVPs; Zijderveld, 1967). For representation of these demagnetization diagrams, th e software package Rema6 (AGICO) was utilized. Visual inspection determined whether or not th e ChRM had been isolated, and directions were calculated using the principal component analysi s (PCA) approach (Kirschvink, 1980) implemented in the https://paleomagnetism.org web interface package (Koymans et al., 2016).  

Isolation of the ChRM serves a variety of functions. First, it determines if any viscous magnetizations have been effectively removed. These could occur naturally or via drill string overprin t acquired during core collection. A drilling overprint will present as a steeply inclined direction i n OVPs and is routinely found during coring operations. Additionally, determination of the ChR M ensures that the correct geomagnetic polarity sequence has been identified.

# 6.3.2. Rock magnetic measurements  

A subset of the representative discrete samples was subjected to isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) experiments following AF demagnetization. We chose representative samples fro m each lithologic and volcanic unit to conduct a pilot study investigating any mineralogical change s occurring downcore. Impulse fields were imparted with an ASC Scientific Impulse Magnetize r (Model IM-10-30) along the positive $z_{\mathrm{\cdot}}$ -axis up to the saturation IRM (SIRM) at $1200~\mathrm{mT}$ . Backfields (negative $z_{\cdot}$ -axis) were imparted following one of the three different sequences (Table T5), depending on time. The full sequence applied on at least one sample per unit consists of equidistant field steps on a log scale between 10 and $1200\ \mathrm{mT}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , including two additional steps at 100 an d $300~\mathrm{mT}$ . These measurements permit deconvolution of the IRM acquisition curves to examin e mixed ferromagnetic assemblages (Maxbauer et al., 2016). A modified version of this sequenc e was employed to expedite measurements. A 3-step sequence—using only $1200~\mathrm{{mT}}$ and two backfields (100 and $300\,\mathrm{mT}$ )—was also used on additional samples from cores already characterized b y one of the longer sequences. Some intraparametric ratios can also be calculated from these measurements. Hard IRM $\left(\mathrm{HIRM}=0.5\times\left[\mathrm{SIRM}+\mathrm{IRM}_{-300\mathrm{mT}}\right]\right.$ ; Thompson and Oldfield, 1986) and th e S-ratio $\mathrm{=IRM_{-300mT}/S I R M}$ (Bloemendal et al., 1992) are used to monitor the contribution and concentration of high-coercivity minerals (hematite $^+$ goethite). $\mathrm{IRM}_{-100\mathrm{mT}}/\mathrm{SIRM}$ (IRM100/SIRM) i s used as a proxy of low-coercivity mineral phases (e.g., [titano]magnetite and [titano]maghemite).  

During Expedition 393, measurements of magnetic susceptibility at two different frequencies, lo w field $\left(\mathrm{\chi_{lf}}\right)$ and high field $\left(\mathrm{\chi_{hf}}\right)$ $\mathrm{\Delta\zeta_{hf})\Delta\left(\chi_{l f}=465~\mathrm{Hz}\right.}$ and $\chi_{\mathrm{hf}}=4650\ \mathrm{Hz})$ were performed using a Bartingto n MS2B magnetic susceptibility meter. The frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility $\left(\chi_{\mathrm{fd}_{/0}^{}}\right)$ , a s $\chi_{\mathrm{fd}\%}\,=\,\left[(\chi_{\mathrm{lf}}-\,\chi_{\mathrm{hf}})/\chi_{\mathrm{lf}}\right]\,\times\,100\$ (Dearing et al., 1996), was calculated to estimate the contribution o f superparamagnetic particles (Thompson and Oldfield, 1986; Dearing et al., 1996).  

The anisotropy of low-field magnetic susceptibility (AMS) was measured for all discrete sample s to characterize the rock texture or petrofabric. AMS depicts the preferred orientations and degre e of alignment of minerals (ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, and diamagnetic phases) in rocks and sediments. This permits us to investigate sediment compaction and whether paleocurrent direction s were recorded. AMS is also used to determine if there is any superimposed deformation, eithe r tectonic or sampling/drilling related. In addition, AMS can be used to evaluate flow fabrics fo r basement basaltic rocks, although this is often not straightforward and prone to bias data (e.g., Schöbel et al., 2013). AMS is described by a triaxial ellipsoid with principal axis lengths equal t o the eigenvalues of the magnetic susceptibility tensor, $K_{\mathrm{max}}\geq K_{\mathrm{int}}\geq K_{\mathrm{min}},$ that correspond to th e maximum, intermediate, and minimum susceptibility axes, respectively. AMS was measured wit h the MFK2-FA multifunction frequency Kappabridge (AGICO) (sensitivity $=2\times10^{-8}\;\mathrm{SI}_{.}$ ) using 97 5 Hz frequency and the 3-position protocol. The susceptibility tensor and associated eigenvalue s were calculated using Anisoft (AGICO) software (v.5.1.03). Anisoft software was also used to correct the direction of the three principal AMS ellipsoid axes for samples taken from cores that ha d been oriented with the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool. To describe and quantify the AM S ellipsoid, we used the following parameters:  

• Magnetic lineation $\left(L=K_{\operatorname*{max}}/K_{\mathrm{int}}\right)$ Balsley and Buddington, 1960), • Magnetic foliation $'F=K_{\mathrm{int}}/K_{\mathrm{min}}\!$ ; Stacey et al., 1960), • Anisotropy degree ${}^{P}$ ; Jelinek, 1981), and • Shape parameter ( $T;$ Jelinek, 1981).

# 6.4. Magnetostratigraphy  

The SAT drill sites are located between ${\sim}30^{\circ}15^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ and $30^{\circ}57^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ . At these latitudes, the sites are sufficiently distant from the Equator that changes in inclination are discernible. Moreover, by assuming that a geocentric axial dipole characterizes the magnetic field at this Southern Hemispher e location, a field inclination of approximately $-49.1^{\circ}$ (tan $[I]=2$ tan[lat], where $I=$ inclination an d lat $=$ latitude) is predicted. Negative inclinations therefore represent normal polarity and positiv e inclinations represent reversed polarity. We used the geomagnetic polarity timescale of Gradstei n et al. (2020) (GPTS2020) for correlation and age assignment, assisted by the biostratigraphi c datums. The spliced inclination stratigraphy (see Stratigraphic correlation) was used durin g Expedition 393 to complete the remanence data where significant gaps were observed in the stratigraphic column. The GPTS2020 scale completes the astronomical-tuned age model for nearly al l chrons, whereas earlier scales required interpolations from spreading rate models for the Sout h Atlantic C-sequence synthetic profile of marine magnetic anomalies.  

# 7. Age model and mass accumulation rates  

# 7.1. Age models  

The age models for sediments recovered along the SAT are based on calcareous nannoplankto n and planktic foraminiferal datums and paleomagnetic reversals. Biostratigraphic datums wer e placed at the midpoint between samples that contain the datum and the nearest sample that doe s not. Likewise, paleomagnetic reversals were placed at midpoints between inflection points in th e declination or inclination curves for magnetochron boundaries. The placement of datums at th e midpoint between samples represents a source of uncertainty in the age-depth calculation, whic h is shown on age-depth plots by vertical error bars on each data point. These error bars do no t incorporate uncertainty from diachroneity of first and last occurrences of microfossils betwee n mid-latitude and tropical/subtropical sites, which is well documented (e.g., Dowsett, 1988; Lam e t al., 2022) and yet difficult to quantify without an independent age model (see Biostratigraphy an d Paleomagnetism for detailed explanations of biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic datums, respectively). Age determinations for both biostratigraphic datums and paleomagnetic reversals ar e based on Gradstein et al. (2020) (as modified by King et al., 2020, for Neogene planktic foraminifera) unless otherwise stated. Datums and ages are illustrated in Figure F21.  

# 7.2. Linear sedimentation rates  

Linear sedimentation rates (LSRs) were calculated using both magnetochronology and biostratigraphy. For Expedition 390 (Sites U1556, U1557, U1559, and U1561), these plots use the CSF- B depth scale; for Expedition 393 (Sites U1558, U1560, and U1583), the plots use the CSF-A dept h scale. The LSR curve was drawn through the most robust biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic datums, avoiding datums that were identified based on poorly preserved specimens, hav e inconsistent occurrences, resulted in age inversions, have high uncertainty because of taxon rarity, and/or were highly diachronous compared to other fossil groups (e.g., planktic foraminifera l datums that lie outside of the age model compared to calcareous nannofossils).  

# 7.3. Mass accumulation rates  

Bulk sediment mass accumulation rates (MARs) were calculated based on the LSR and sedimen t density. Sediment density used in MAR calculations is calculated from GRA measured on th e WRMSL and calibrated by discrete dry bulk density (DBD) measurements conducted shipboar d (see Physical properties and downhole measurements).  

To convert GRA measurements to DBD, percent porosity (POR) was calculated for each GRA dat a point by dividing the difference in GRA and grain density (GD) by the difference in GD and wate r density (WD), using $1.03\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ as the density of water and $2.71\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ as the density of sedimen t grains (calcite and clays have similar grain densities: 2.71 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ for calcite and ${\sim}2.75~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ fo r illite):  

$$
\mathrm{POR}=100-\{100\times[(\mathrm{GRA}-\mathrm{GD})/(\mathrm{GD}-\mathrm{WD})]\}.
$$  

Then, DBD was calculated by multiplying the assumed GD by the calculated POR:  

$$
{\mathrm{DBD}}={\mathrm{GD}}\times[1-({\mathrm{POR}}/100)].
$$  

MAR was calculated using the following equation:  

$$
\mathrm{MAR}\;(\mathrm{g/cm^{2}/k y})=\mathrm{LSR}\;(\mathrm{cm/ky})\times\mathrm{DBD}\;(\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}).
$$  

Carbonate accumulation rates (CARs) and organic carbon accumulation rates (OCARs) were calculated by multiplying the weight percent of carbonate $\left(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\right)$ and total organic carbon (TOC), which were both acquired on carbonate samples, by the MAR calculated for the same sample:  

$$
\mathrm{CAR}=\mathrm{LSR}\times\mathrm{DBD}\times\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\,(\mathrm{wt}\%),\,\mathrm{and}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{OCAR}=\mathrm{LSR}\times\mathrm{DBD}\times\mathrm{TOC}\,(\mathrm{wt}\%).
$$  

Time steps for MAR are based on the sampling density for $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ and TOC (routinely once o r twice per core).  

# 8. Physical properties and downhole measurements  

Physical properties measurements were taken during the SAT expeditions to characterize th e physical, chemical, and structural properties of the recovered sediment and rock cores and th e formation surrounding the borehole. These core and downhole log data are also used to link th e geologic observations made on the core to the regional geophysical survey data. Physical properties measured during the expeditions include bulk density, NGR, magnetic susceptibility, compressional and shear velocities, thermal conductivity, porosity, shear strength, and electrica l resistivity. They were characterized using a variety of techniques and methods on core section s and samples, as well as a series of downhole measurements carried out through wireline logging o f the drilled and cored boreholes, as described below.  

# 8.1. Standard physical properties measurements and core flow  

Physical properties measurements on sediment cores followed this general sample workflow:  

1. After core sections were curated and laser engraved, sections were analyzed on the STMSL so that the data could be used in stratigraphic correlation.   
2. Whole-round core sections $_{>50\;\mathrm{cm}}$ long) were run on the NGRL.   
3. Core sections were thermally equilibrated to ambient room temperature $({\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ for ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{h}$ .   
4. Whole-round core sections were run on the WRMSL: GRA bulk densitometer, magnetic susceptibility pass-through loop system (loop magnetic susceptibility [MSL]), and PWL.   
5. Whole-round core sections were passed to geochemistry and microbiology teams for dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ measurements and Rhizon sampling (see Geochemistry and Microbiology).   
6. Thermal conductivity (TCON) was measured once per core.   
7. Cores were split lengthwise into archive and working halves.   
8. Samples for MAD analyses were collected from the working half, generally two per core in representative lithologies, and analyzed for MAD properties.   
9. Discrete compressional velocity measurements were made on the working half using the Section Half Measurement Gantry (SHMG).   
10. Strength measurements were made on the working half using the automated vane shear (AVS) and pocket penetrometer (soft sediments only).   
11. The archive half of the core sections was passed through the SHIL for imaging and the SHMSL for RSC and MSP measurements.  

Expedition 393 followed a slightly modified workflow for sediment cores. During this expedition, dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ measurements were made by the geochemistry and microbiology group on wholeround core sections immediately after STMSL logging. Thermal conductivity was measured o n section halves after splitting. Additionally, the archive halves were run on the X-ray Imaging Logger just after splitting or after full completion of the hole, before storing the sections in the reefer.  

Hard rock cores followed a slightly different sequence:  

1. Core sections were shaken out onto the core cutting table, and pieces were oriented where possible. At this point, discrete pieces were removed for microbiological work (see Microbiology).   
2. Discrete pieces of a given recovered hard rock section were shaken into a sterile split liner in the core splitting room for examination by a petrologist and/or a structural geologist, who determined the splitting line for obtaining working and archive halves from each whole-round piece. The core pieces were then put back into a full core section liner with plastic spacers between curated pieces (see Introduction).   
3. Core sections were thermally equilibrated to ambient room temperature $({\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ for ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{h}$ .   
4. NGRL measurements (for sections $>\!50\,\mathsf{c m}$ in length) and X-ray imaging, neither of which were sensitive to temperature, were made on whole-round sections during this equilibration time.   
5. After equilibration, whole-round core sections were run on the WRMSL with the GRA bulk densitometer and MSL (PWL was turned off).   
6. Whole-round core exteriors were imaged on a DMT digital color CoreScan3 system.   
7. Cores were split into archive and working halves along the previously marked splitting lines.   
8. The archive half of the cores was passed through the SHIL for imaging and SHMSL for RSC and MSP.   
9. Oriented, discrete cube samples $({\sim}8~\mathrm{cm^{3}})$ were taken from the working-half cores for $P$ -wave velocity and MAD analyses, generally two per core, in representative lithologies. These cubes were also used for paleomagnetic measurements (see Paleomagnetism) to minimize the material removed from the core. The samples were placed in seawater under vacuum for 4–12 h for resaturation before measurement. Discrete samples were measured for $P$ -wave velocity in three orthogonal directions and then processed for MAD analyses.   
10. Selected pieces of core sections were also resaturated for $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ under vacuum and measured for thermal conductivity. This analysis was nondestructive; pieces were returned to the core following measurement.  

During Expedition 393, the whole-round sections were usually run through DMT imaging befor e NGRL or WRMSL, and selected sections were run on the X-ray imager after the NGRL.  

A subset of the physical properties measurements were made during Expeditions 390 and 393 o n cores recovered from Expeditions 390C and 395E (Estes et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2021). Onl y archive halves of the Expedition 390C and 395E sediment cores were available during Expedition s 390 and 393; therefore, only nondestructive SHMSL and SHIL measurements were made.  

Hard rock (lithified sediment and igneous basement) core sections associated with the sediment/ basement interfaces that were recovered during Expeditions 390C and 395E received the full arra y of hard rock core measurements listed above.  

# 8.2. Whole-round core section measurements  

Whole-round cores were used to collect measurements of NGR, MS, compressional wave velocity, thermal conductivity, and digital images.  

# 8.2.1. Special Task Multisensor Logger  

The STMSL is run during sediment coring on whole-round sections immediately after lase r engraving. The recovery of a complete stratigraphic section relies on the rapid hole-to-hole stratigraphic correlation of incoming sediment cores. The STMSL was used to measure GRA and MS a t a sampling interval of $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ (see Whole-Round Multisensor Logger below). The data were use d for real-time stratigraphic correlation (see Stratigraphic correlation). Higher resolution GR A and MS data were later measured using the WRMSL after the core sections had thermally equilibrated to ambient room temperature.  

# 8.2.2. Natural Gamma Radiation Logger  

Natural gamma rays occur primarily as the result of the decay of $^{238}\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ isotopes. Because radioactive decay and the resultant gamma ray emissions are not sensitive to temperature, the whole-round cores could be run through the NGRL before equilibrating to room temperature. The NGRL detector unit was calibrated using $^{137}\!C s$ and $^{60}{\bf C o}$ sources and identifying the peaks a t 662 $\left(^{137}\mathrm{Cs}\right)$ and $1330\,\mathrm{keV}$ $(^{60}\mathrm{Co})$ .  

Counts were summed over the range of $100{-}3000\,\mathrm{keV}$ during Expeditions 390 and 393 to be compatible with data collection from Expeditions 390C and 395E and for direct comparison wit h downhole logging data. Background gamma radiation measurements of an empty core line r counted for 21,600 s (6 h) were made prior to measuring core sections. The background signal i s then automatically subtracted from the measured values of the core sections. A new backgroun d gamma radiation measurement is only necessary when the ship moves ${\geq}2^{\circ}$ latitude, which mad e quantification of background gamma radiation only necessary once during Expedition 390 an d once during Expedition 393.  

A single NGRL run consisted of two sets of measurements taken by eight sensors, each spaced 2 0 cm apart. The two sets of measurements were offset by $10\,\mathsf{c m}$ , which yielded a total of 16 measurements equally spaced $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ apart over a $150~\mathrm{cm}$ long section of core. The quality of the energ y spectrum measured in a core depends on the concentration of radionuclides in the sample and o n the counting time, with higher times yielding more clearly defined spectra. Each set of measurements for a single NGRL run were counted for $300~\mathrm{s}$ . Core sections ${<}50~\mathrm{cm}$ in length were no t typically run through the NGRL because of constraints imposed by the sensor geometry.  

The shipboard NGRL acquisition system outputs only the total counts. However, it also stores th e whole spectrum for all element-specific energy intervals, which can be used to extract the singl e contribution and concentration of K, U, and Th.  

During Expedition 393, an open access MATLAB algorithm designed by De Vleeschouwer et al. (2017) to extract, quantify, and correct the K, U, and Th concentrations was adapted to the mos t recent LIMS file nomenclature. The script provides an estimate of the K, U, and Th contents b y integrating NGR counts over specific energy intervals and by comparing those counts to energ y spectra of the shipboard standards that are used to calibrate the NGRL.  

# 8.2.3. Whole-Round Multisensor Logger  

Following temperature equilibration, whole-round core sections were measured on the WRMSL, which nondestructively measures GRA for bulk density, MS, and $P$ -wave velocity on whole-roun d core sections. The sampling interval was set at $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ for both sediment and hard rock for eac h measurement. The sampling interval was chosen to collect the maximum number of quality measurements while not slowing core flow. QA/QC was monitored and maintained by running a cor e liner with freshwater through the WRMSL after every full core.  

WRMSL measurements are most accurate on a liner completely filled with core that has experienced minimal drilling disturbance. As a result, the diameter of the core liner $\left(66\;\mathrm{mm}\right)$ ) is assume d for hard rock density calculations, even though the liner is often less than $100\%$ filled. Furthermore, hard rock material was often recovered in disaggregated pieces rather than as a continuou s core, which reduces the rock volume. Therefore, GRA bulk density and MS measurements ofte n underestimate actual values for hard rock cores but still provide useful information for stratigraphic correlation and can be compared to the discrete measurements of density, MS, and $P$ -wav e velocity. $P$ -wave velocities measured by the WRMSL suffer the most because of poor coupling o n hard rock core sections and were thus measured only on sediment core sections.  

# 8.2.3.1. Gamma ray attenuation bulk density  

The GRA densitometer on the WRMSL operates by passing gamma rays from a $^{137}\!C s$ source dow n through a whole-round core section into a $75\,\mathrm{\mm}\,\times\,75\,\mathrm{\mm}$ sodium iodide detector locate d directly below the core. Gamma rays with an energy peak at $662\;\mathrm{keV}$ are attenuated by Compto n scattering as they pass through the core. The resultant gamma ray count is proportional to bul k density. Calibration of the GRA densitometer was performed using core liners filled with seawate r and aluminum density standards. Recalibration was performed as needed if the value of the freshwater QA/QC standard run after every full core deviated significantly (more than a few percent ) from $1\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The spatial resolution of the GRA densitometer is $<\!1\;\mathrm{cm}$ .  

# 8.2.3.2. Magnetic susceptibility  

Magnetic susceptibility $(k)$ is a dimensionless measure of the degree to which a material can b e magnetized by an external magnetic field:  

$$
k\!=\!M/H,
$$  

where $M$ is the magnetization induced in the material by an external field strength $(H)$ . Magneti c susceptibility responds to variations in the type and concentration of magnetic grains, making i t useful for identifying compositional variations and alteration in hard rock cores. In the case o f sediments, magnetic susceptibility can often be related to mineralogical composition (e.g., terrigenous versus biogenic material) and diagenetic overprinting (e.g., clays from the alteration of igneous materials have a susceptibility orders of magnitude lower than the material’s original iro n oxide constituents). Water and plastics (core liner) have a slightly negative magnetic susceptibility.  

The WRMSL incorporates a Bartington Instruments MS2 meter coupled to an MS2C sensor coi l with a diameter of $8.8~\mathrm{cm}$ that operates at a frequency of $565~\mathrm{Hz}$ (Bartington Instruments, Ltd., 2011). The sensor output can be set to centimeter-gram-second (cgs) units or SI units; IODP standard practice is to use the SI setting. MS is reported in instrument units. To convert results int o dimensionless units, it is necessary to multiply the data by a correction factor that is a function o f the probe type, core diameter, and loop size. The sizes of small rock pieces in incomplete core s vary, so application of a single correction factor is not justified; therefore, no correction is applie d to the WRMSL magnetic susceptibility data. This conversion factor does not change the order o f magnitude of the measured susceptibility values, so the results are comparable with the susceptibility measured by the paleomagnetism group with the same physical units (SI).  

The MS2C coil was calibrated with a homogeneous mixture of magnetite and epoxy in a $40~\mathrm{{cm}}$ long piece of core liner to an accuracy of $\pm5\%$ . The resolution of the method was $\pm4\,\mathrm{cm}$ for continuous core section; therefore, magnetic susceptibility was underestimated for core material tha t was not continuous over an $8\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ interval.  

# 8.2.3.3. P-wave velocity  

$P$ -wave velocity of the whole-round sediment core sections was measured through the incorporated PWL in the WRMSL. The PWL uses a $500\,\mathrm{kHz}$ compressional wave pulse transmitted acros s the core liner (orthogonal to depth) between two transducer-coupled calipers. Coupling betwee n the calipers and the core liner was aided by water continuously dripping across the caliper surfaces. The pulse waveform was bandpass filtered between 0.4 and $1.0\,\mathrm{MHz}$ , stacked, summed, an d ensemble-averaged to allow for automatic first arrival picking by the integrated WRMSL software. The PWL automatically corrected for the acrylic liner and was calibrated using known velocitie s of a freshwater-filled liner and aluminum standards. Because XCB and RCB coring in hard roc k often produces cores that do not fill the core liner and air-filled voids are introduced, the PWL wa s only active in the WRMSL runs on the sediment cores and was not active for the hard rock wholeround cores.  

# 8.3. Digital imaging  

Imaging of hard rock core exteriors was carried out on a DMT digital color CoreScan3 syste m prior to splitting the cores into their working and archive halves (Figure F24A). The DMT CoreScan3 produces a full-circumference image of drill core up to $^{1\,}\mathbf{m}$ long and $25{-}150\;\mathrm{mm}$ in diameter. In $360^{\circ}$ mode, true color images are recorded at 5, 10, or 40 pixel/mm resolution by a linesca n camera as the core is incrementally rotated about its cylindrical axis. This camera captures a ne w line of the full core length every time the circumference rotates by 1 pixel (DMT GeoTec, 1996; DMT GmbH, 2000). The advantage of obtaining such a high-resolution image data set is that i t permanently records the original core’s external features that are lost once it is split into two halve s and sampled. Use of these images for core-log integration, as well as machine learning applications, requires them to be a consistent and accurate depiction of the original core, so a systemati c approach should be taken to avoid variation in two images of the same rock type.  

Whole-round DMT CoreScan3 digital images are recorded in association with the IODP CR F (Figure F24D; see Alteration petrology). The red/blue cutting line drawn on the outside of th e whole round core surface denotes a plane separating the working and archive halves with the coordinates of $090^{\circ}$ in the CRF (Figure F24E). For Expedition 393, during postacquisition processin g images were orientated to maintain consistency with the CRF using the software package CoreScan3.  

Standard procedure during IODP expeditions is to divide each $9.5\textrm{m}$ core recovered into $1.5~\mathrm{m}$ sections; however, the DMT CoreScan3 is limited to sections $^{\le1\textrm{m}}$ . Fortunately, even cores wit h high recovery consisted of many continuous yet fractured pieces that could fit on the scanner. Th e IODP curatorial process involves dividing the typically fragmented/fractured hard rock core sections into core pieces, or bins (see Core handling and analysis). The bins are numbered sequentially downhole in each section, starting with 1, and their top and bottom offsets (within th e section) are recorded in a piece log that is uploaded to the LIMS database after curation. Bins tha t contain multiple continuous fragments are given the same bin number, but the fragments, or subpieces, are lettered consecutively from top to bottom (see Core handling and analysis). Only th e exterior of round pieces that were able to roll about their cylindrical axis were scanned, althoug h some pieces that were too uneven to roll cleanly were supported using two round foam pad s braced by concrete cylinders (Figure F24B). Core bins that contained fragmented and rubbl y material were not scanned.  

All cores were scanned in high-resolution mode (40 pixels $^\mathrm{\prime}\mathrm{mm}$ ), which limits a single image fram e to just $25\;\mathrm{cm}$ , so longer pieces were scanned in multiple $25\;\mathrm{cm}$ frames starting with the top $25\;\mathrm{cm}$ and working downcore until the whole piece was imaged. All subpieces in a single bin were considered a single piece and scanned together, and if their combined length was ${>}25~\mathrm{cm}$ they wer e scanned in multiple frames. Additional blue lines were marked at $20\;\mathrm{cm}$ intervals along the exterior of the core in this case to enable images to be cropped and reconstructed using a dedicate d Python script (see Core image processing) (Figure F25). Finally, any highly fractured core tha t still fit together to form a cylinder was secured using rubber bands or shrink-wrapped prior t o scanning, though this was a last resort because the wrapping creates interference in the imag e because of spurious reflectance.

Default settings for the CoreScan3 software were customized to ensure minimal correction by th e software to ensure a consistent brightness across the data set. These settings are imperative fo r accurate manipulation by the Python program and include the following:  

• Disabling Auto-adjust exposure; • Selecting No core detection, no selection; and • Choosing the Slightly lighter exposure setting  

During Expedition 393, an X-Rite ColorChecker balance chart was imaged every $12~\mathrm{~h~}$ durin g imaging periods to standardize colors across each unwrapped core image scan.  

# 8.3.1. Core image processing  

Each core piece scanned on the DMT CoreScan3 was saved both as DMT and BMP files an d named using the following convention: Expedition of core recovery-Site-Hole-Core-SectionBin.Extension (e.g., 390C-U1556A-2R-1-Pc1.DMT). If a bin contained multiple subpieces tha t were scanned separately, each piece’s file name was appended with a numbered identifier followe d by an x (e.g., 390C-U1556A-2R-1-Pc1-1x.DMT). Similarly, if a long piece (or multiple continuou s pieces) were scanned together but in separate frames, each filename is also appended with a numbered identifier followed by an $\mathbf{x}$ (e.g., 390C-U1556A-2R-1-Pc1-1x.DMT; 390C-U1556A-2R-1- Pc1-2x.DMT) (for examples see Figure F25).  

Individual image frames were stitched together to reconstruct bins ${>}25~\mathrm{cm}$ to provide a singl e high-resolution image per whole-round core section. Image processing was carried out using  a

Python program to allow comparison between full section DMT and SHIL data sets that will b e made available postexpedition.  

Because the DMT’s computer was not able to be connected to the ship’s server, a 1 TB externa l solid-state hard drive was strapped to the desk to avoid knocking and all images were save d directly onto it. These images were then exported manually to another hard drive before bein g copied onto the backup servers aboard the ship at the end of each shift.  

# 8.4. Thermal conductivity  

TCON is the coefficient of proportionality relating conductive heat flow to a thermal gradien t (Blum, 1997). Thermal conductivity was measured using the transient needle probe method i n whole- or half-space geometry (Von Herzen and Maxwell, 1959), using a Teka Bolin TK04 system.  

For a minority of sediment cores, thermal conductivity was measured after whole-round core sections had equilibrated to room temperature but prior to the cores being split. The needle prob e method was used in full-space configuration for soft sediments (Von Herzen and Maxwell, 1959). The needle probe was inserted into the unconsolidated sediment through $2\;\mathrm{mm}$ holes drilled int o the core liner roughly once per core, generally in locations determined using MS data gathered o n the WRMSL. In general, MS is lower in carbonate-rich intervals and higher in clay-rich intervals. Both kinds of intervals were targeted in order to assess thermal conductivity in these end-membe r lithologies.  

For the majority of sediment cores, thermal conductivity was measured with a half-space needl e puck (similar to the method used for hard rock) because the needle probe method was found t o result in poor data quality. The needle puck was pressed gently against a split core section of th e working half to measure thermal conductivity.  

For hard rock material, TCON measurements were taken from pieces that were at least $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ lon g after splitting. If the split face of the piece was significantly rough, a lap plate and grit were used t o smooth the sample face for better connection to the probe. The split samples were first saturate d in ambient-temperature seawater for $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ with a vacuum pump to aid in the full saturation of por e space. A puck with the measurement probe was attached to the split face and secured with a stra p or rubber band. Three steps of heating–cooling cycles were used, and the final TCON value wa s the mean of the three cycles, although data from each of the cycles are also recorded in the LIM S database.  

# 8.5. Split core section-half and discrete measurements  

Once cores were split, samples for discrete petrophysical measurements were taken for MA D analysis, as well as $P$ -wave velocity in the case of hard rock. For soft rocks, discrete samples wer e taken for MAD analysis; however, shear strength and $P$ -wave velocity measurements were mad e directly on the cut surface of the working half. Meanwhile, the archive half was used for nondestructive SHMSL measurements and half-round imaging of the split core surface on the SHIL.  

# 8.5.1. X-ray image logger (Expedition 393)  

During Expedition 393, X-ray images were recorded on the archive half of each section of sediment recovered to evaluate bioturbation intensity, drilling disturbance, or any structures or features that could produce a recognizable density signature. X-ray imaging was also attempted o n selected sections of basement but produced underwhelming results. The X-ray imager is composed of a Teledyne ICM CP120B X-ray generator and a detector unit. The generator works wit h a maximum voltage of $120\;\mathrm{kV}$ and a tube current of $1\,\mathrm{mA}$ , and the focal spot is $0.8\:\mathrm{mm}\times0.5\:\mathrm{mm}.$ . The generator produces a directional cone at a beam angle of $50^{\circ}\,\times\,50^{\circ}$ . The detector unit i s located $65\;\mathrm{cm}$ from the source and consists of a Go-Scan $1510\;\mathrm{H}$ system composed of an array o f complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors arranged to offer an active area o f $102{\mathrm{\:mm}}\times153{\mathrm{\:mm}}$ and a resolution of $99\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ . Core sections were run through the imaging area a t $12\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals, providing images of $15\;\mathrm{cm}$ onto the detector with an overlap of $3\,\mathrm{cm}$ .  

Tests were conducted to obtain the best image resolution for determining the internal structure o f the cores, beginning with a standard $80\,\mathrm{kV}$ voltage and $1.0\;\mathrm{mA}$ current, $60\:\mathrm{ms}$ exposure time, an d stack of 20 images for all cores. Some adjustments were made during the course of the expeditio n to improve the image quality in different lithologies. Separate routines were developed for basement and sediment cores, where both used a $300\,\mathrm{ms}$ exposure time and a stack of 20 images. Basement core images were acquired using a $100~\mathrm{kV}$ voltage and $0.6~\mathrm{mA}$ current, whereas sedimen t cores were scanned using $80\,\mathrm{kV}$ and $0.5~\mathrm{mA}$ . Image processing parameters were set to a range o f 0–1 for basement cores and 0–2 for sediment cores, with a $1\%$ mask threshold for both.  

The raw images were collected as 16-bit images and were processed with the IODP in-house processing utility in the IMS software. The software applies corrections for the detector (gain an d offset corrections), compensates for core shape and thickness, and adjusts the image contrast. Th e Savitzky-Golay finite impulse response (FIR) filter is used to smooth images. The resulting processed images include a masked background, the depth scale of the section, and the acquisitio n parameters. The software applies different processing to APC or rotary cores.  

The X-ray imager was not run during Expedition 390 because of time and staffing limitations.  

# 8.5.2. Section-Half Multisensor Logger  

# 8.5.2.1. Point magnetic susceptibility  

MSP was measured on archive-half sections using a Bartington Instruments MS2E point sensor a t a higher spatial resolution than MS measured by the WRMSL on whole-round cores. Flush contact between the probe and the archive halves was needed; thus, the sediment section halves wer e covered with plastic wrap to avoid contamination. The instrument takes and averages three measurements made at 1 s intervals to an accuracy of $5\%$ . Before each measurement, the probe wa s zeroed in air and a background magnetic field was measured and removed from the data. MS P measurements were conducted at a resolution of $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ for sediment and hard rock sections.  A built-in laser surface analyzer aided in the recognition of irregularities in the split core surfac e (e.g., cracks and voids) and provided an independent check on the fidelity of SHMSL measurements (e.g., Expeditions 301, 371, and 378 [Expedition 301 Scientists, 2005; Sutherland et al., 2019; Röhl et al., 2022]).  

The Bartington Instruments MS2E point sensor that is used for MSP measurements uses a highe r frequency than the WRMSL $\left(2\,\mathrm{kHz}\right)$ . This could introduce small differences in values measured o n the two systems if superparamagnetic grains displaying frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility are present (Dearing et al., 1996). Further differences may also arise from averaging poin t measurements compared to continuous measurements. Because it is difficult to isolate these different factors, absolute differences between the two magnetic susceptibility systems should b e interpreted with caution.  

# 8.5.2.2. Reflectance spectroscopy and colorimetry  

The reflectance of visible light from the archive halves of sediment cores was measured using a n Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrophotometer mounted on the automated SHMSL. Measurement s were taken at $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ spacing to provide a high-resolution stratigraphic record of color variatio n for visible wavelengths. Empty intervals, voids, and gaps were skipped to avoid spurious measurements. Intervals where the top of the flat hard rock surface was below the level of the core line r were lifted by adding support matting or foam beneath each hard rock piece to ensure good contact with the sensor. Each measurement was recorded in $2\,\mathrm{nm}$ wide spectral bands from 400 to 70 0 nm. Colorimetry and reflectance data were reported using the $\mathrm{L^{*}}\mathbf{a}^{*}\mathbf{b}^{*}$ color system, in which $L^{\ast}$ i s lightness, $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ is redness (positive) versus greenness (negative), and $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ is yellowness (positive) versu s blueness (negative). The color reflectance spectrometer calibrates on two spectra, pure whit e (reference) and pure black (dark). Color calibration was conducted approximately once every $^{6\,\mathrm{h}}$ (twice per shift).  

# 8.5.3. Pocket penetrometer and vane shear strength  

Both pocket penetrometer and vane shear strength quantify the effective shear strength $\left(\sigma_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ of th e lithology by applying a known compressive and shear stress, respectively.  

The pocket penetrometer (PEN) is an unconfined compression strength test and was measured o n every core. At a prescribed stress, the shear strength of a material or yield $\left(\uptau_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$ is related to th e compressive strength $(\Delta\sigma_{\mathrm{f}})$ by  

$$
\tau_{\mathrm{f}}=\Delta\sigma_{\mathrm{f}}/2.
$$  

The penetrometer uses a $6.4~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter probe, which is gently pushed into the core below th e split core section surface to a marked line on the probe. The selected probe location must b e where core section surfaces are smooth. The mechanical scale is in kilograms per square centimeter, and the maximum value measurable by the pocket penetrometer is $4.5\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ . The data wer e uploaded to the LIMS database in $\mathrm{kg/cm^{2}}$ and can be converted to kPa as follows:  

$$
2\mathrm{{\tau}_{f}}\left(\mathrm{kPa}\right)=981\times2\mathrm{{\tau}_{f}}\left(\mathrm{kg/cm^{2}}\right)\!.
$$  

The vane shear strength (AVS) test is an undrained shear strength test, implying that the quantified shear strength is the effective shear strength, which corresponds to the applied stress minu s the intergranular pore fluid pressure $(\uprho_{\mathrm{f}})$ :  

$$
\upsigma_{\mathrm{~m~}}^{\prime}=\upsigma_{\mathrm{m}}-\uprho_{\mathrm{f}},
$$  

where  

$$
\sigma_{\mathrm{m}}=\left[\sigma_{1}-\sigma_{3}\right]/2.
$$  

The Giesa AVS system is suited for measuring the shear strength of very soft to relatively stif f marine sediments and is especially useful for analyzing undisturbed clay- or silt-rich samples. Th e system consists of a controller and a gantry for shear vane insertion. A four-bladed miniature van e was pushed carefully into the sediment of the working halves until the top of the vane was leve l with the core surface. The vane was then rotated to determine the torque required to cause th e core material to shear (failure torque). All vane shear strength measurements were obtained usin g a $12.7\ \mathrm{mm}$ vane. Failure torque was determined by measuring the rotation of a torsional sprin g using a spring-specific relation between rotation angle and torque.  

Vane shear strength $\mathrm{(Su[V])}$ can be determined as described by Blum (1997):  

$$
\mathrm{Su(V)}=T/\mathrm{Kv}=[\Delta/\mathrm{B}]/\mathrm{Kv},
$$  

where  

$T=$ torque required to induce material failure (in N·m),   
$\operatorname{Kv}=$ constant, depending on vane dimensions $(\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{m}^{3})$ ),   
$\Delta=$ maximum torque angle (in degrees) at failure, and   
$\mathbf{B}=$ spring constant that relates the deflection angle to the torque $(\mathrm{in\Omega^{\circ}/N{\cdot}m})$  

We performed one measurement per sediment core section until the recovered material becam e too stiff for vane insertion. Measurements were conducted in regions considered to be the mos t representative of the core lithology. Shear and compressional strength measurements should b e considered approximations of the true sediment strength, as these experiments do not account fo r pore pressure changes in the cores after splitting.  

# 8.5.4. Moisture and density  

Two discrete samples were taken per core from the working half ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ samples in sedimen t and $\{\sim}8\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ samples in hard rock), with additional samples taken at notable lithologic boundaries. The aim was to have at least one sample characterizing each lithologic unit. In indurated sedimen t and hard rock, discrete samples were extracted for MAD analyses as well as $P$ -wave velocity measurements and paleomagnetism where possible. MAD samples were used to measure wet and dr y bulk density, grain density, water content, and porosity following methods presented in Blu m (1997), which are briefly outlined below. In hard rocks, MAD samples are typically taken fro m rock pieces appearing cohesive enough to withstand being cut into cubes, which may bias the dat a toward higher density values than any surrounding more heterogeneous intervals. During Expedition 393, the initial mass was also measured prior to saturation.  

Preweighed and numbered $16~\mathrm{mL}$ Wheaton glass vials were used to process and store the sediment samples. Following measurement of wet mass, samples were dried in a convection oven fo r at least $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $105^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Dried samples were then cooled in a desiccator for at least $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ before th e dry mass and volume were measured. For hard rock, the procedure included resaturation wit h seawater for $4{-}12\,\mathrm{h}$ under vacuum before the wet mass measurement was conducted.  

Wet and dry sample masses were measured to a precision of $0.005\mathrm{~g~}$ using dual-Mettler Toled o (XS204) electronic balances, with one acting as a reference. A standard with a comparable mass t o each sample was placed on the reference balance and the computer averaging system compensate d for the ship’s motion by taking multiple measurements—typically 300 per sample.  

Dry sample volumes were determined using a hexapycnometer system of a six-celled customconfigured Micrometrics AccuPyc 1330TC helium-displacement pycnometer. The system measures dry sample volume using pressurized He-filled chambers, where the precision of each cel l was $1\%$ of the full-scale volume. Volume measurements were preceded by three purges of the sample chamber with helium. For each measurement, five unknown cells and one cell that containe d two stainless steel calibration spheres with a total volume of ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ were run. Calibratio n spheres were sequentially cycled through the cells to identify any systematic error and/or instrument drift. The volumes occupied by the numbered Wheaton vials were calculated before th e expedition by multiplying each vial’s weight against the average density of the vial glass. The fundamental relation and assumptions for the calculations of all physical properties parameters, suc h as wet bulk density $\left(\uprho_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , dry bulk density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , sample grain density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , porosity $(\Phi)$ , and voi d ratio (VR) were included in the MADMax shipboard program set with the “Method $C^{\prime}$ calculatio n process (Blum, 1997).  

# 8.5.5. Discrete $\bar{P}$ -wave velocity  

Triaxial $P$ -wave velocity was measured using the $P$ -wave gantry system on discrete samples generally twice but at least once per core. When lithologies of interest were identified visually, additiona l measurements were taken. Velocity was measured using Panametrics-NDT Microscan delay lin e transducers transmitting at $0.5\,\mathrm{MHz}$ . The signal received through the section half or discrete sample was recorded by the Velocity Gantry 2.0.5.0 IODP software, where the peak of the first $P$ -wav e arrival is either automatically or manually chosen. In case of a weak signal, manual picking of th e first arrival was performed.  

The distance between transducers was measured with a built-in linear voltage displacement transformer (LVDT). Calibration was performed daily with a series of acrylic cylinders of differin g thicknesses and a known $P$ -wave velocity of $2750\,\pm\,20~\mathrm{m/s}$ . The system time delay determine d from calibration was subtracted from the picked arrival time to give a traveltime of the $P$ -wav e through the sample. The thickness of the sample (calculated by the LVDT, in meters) was divide d by the traveltime (in seconds) to calculate $P$ -wave velocity in meters per second. A clean first $P$ - wave arrival can be difficult to pick depending on the material; therefore, distilled water wa s applied to the contacts between sample cube and calipers to improve the coupling and resultin g reading.  

For soft-sediment cores, $P.$ -wave velocity measurements were performed on the working half alon g the $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis. Different positions with respect to lithology were chosen to generate viable data. Discrete measurements were chosen to target intact pieces and avoid the drilling mud from XCB coring, which is significantly softer. Given the instrument uncertainties, the higher discrete $P$ -wav e value was always considered likely to be the better representation of the true $P$ -wave velocity.  

Measurements of hard rock $P$ -wave velocity were made using the $2\ \mathrm{cm}\times2\ \mathrm{cm}\times2\ \mathrm{c}$ m cubes als o used for MAD analysis and paleomagnetism measurements. The $P_{-}$ -wave measurement was take n on the seawater-saturated cube (see Moisture and density) to best represent in situ conditions. The hard rock measurements were conducted after orienting the sample (Blum, 1997) and placin g it on the gantry that measures $P$ -wave velocity in three orthogonal directions $(x-,y-$ , and $z$ -directions). $P$ -wave anisotropy ratios could be calculated from these multidirectional analyses.  

One of the factors affecting the measurements is the less than perfect shape of the cubes, whic h are cut by hand using an electric double-bladed trimming saw from the working half. Despite al l the care taken, they can have slightly nonparallel or irregular surfaces that will affect the velocit y measurement. Considering that any such imperfection can only decrease the velocity (by introducing spaces between the pieces and the transducers), we consider the fastest measurement fo r each sample (regardless of its direction) to be the most representative of the formation at tha t depth.  

# 8.6. Data filtering procedure  

WRMSL and SHMSL data contained spurious values measured at gaps in the core section (empt y intervals), cracks in core pieces, and, for bulk volumetric measurements (WRMSL), due t o reduced volume of material (departure from a continuous cylindrical core) in the vicinity of th e sensor. Filtering out these spurious data points provides a data set more suitable for quantitativ e analysis. In the case of full-diameter continuous core recovery, only a minor amount of filterin g was required, for example for fall-in material at the top of some APC cores. Valid measuremen t intervals were identified from the SHMSL laser profile data, which detects gaps and crack s between pieces. The SHMSL and WRMSL MS data were filtered based on those data. Additiona l manual editing was required in specific intervals where the SHMSL laser could not detect gaps.  

# 8.7. Comparison to ODP Hole 896A  

During Expedition 393, the discrete physical properties measurements on basement (MAD, $V_{\mathrm{p}},$ and TCON) were compared to the same type of data from ODP Hole 896A (Shipboard Scientifi c Party, 1993; Table T6). Hole 896A is located ${\sim}1\,\mathrm{km}$ from the deep ocean crust reference ODP Hol e 504B and was drilled $290~\mathrm{m}$ into heavily sedimented basalts ( ${\sim}179\;\mathrm{m}$ of overburden) that forme d at ${\sim}6.9~\mathrm{Ma}$ at the intermediate-spreading Costa Rica Rift. The Hole 896A data provide a convenient benchmark to compare physical properties measurements from across the SAT. The full dat a set from Hole 896A was used for comparison, and encompasses the range of basalt alteration levels that were sampled from these cores. Because the sediment cover is different between the site s from Expedition 393 and Hole 896A, we compared the data as a function of basement depth rathe r than depth below seafloor.  

# 8.8. Stratigraphic correlation  

The paleoceanographic scientific objectives of the SAT expeditions are best addressed when ther e is recovery of complete stratigraphic sections for all sites. However, recovery of a continuous section from a single IODP hole is technically impossible, even with up to $100\%$ or greater nomina l recovery (e.g., Ruddiman et al., 1987; Hagelberg et al., 1995; Lisiecki and Herbert, 2007), becaus e core recovery gaps occur between successive APC and XCB cores in a single hole. Additionally, tides, ship heave, drilling disturbance, and missing material (through whole-round sampling) generally preclude complete recovery of the sediment package in a single drilled hole. Therefore, construction of a complete stratigraphic section requires multiple holes at a given site referenced to  a composite depth scale. The SAT composite depth and splice construction methodology followe d previous expeditions (e.g., Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 342 and Expedition s 371 and 378 [Norris et al., 2014; Sutherland et al., 2019; Röhl et al., 2022]). By offsetting the recovery depth of cores below seafloor between each hole, it was possible to maximize the probabilit y that adjacent holes recover most core gaps encountered in previous holes. Then, stratigraphi c intervals from two or more holes cored at the same site can be combined into a splice. Where ther e are two holes at a site, stratigraphic gaps often remain.  

The STMSL was used to provide rapid measurements of MS and GRA density for real-time correlation. Correlating the first and second holes, core by core, allows tracking of the depth of corin g gaps in both holes to prevent coinciding core gaps. This required coordination with the drill floo r toolpushers throughout drilling, where we either maintained the drill shot depth, pulled up th e drill string, or advanced the drill string, thus altering the projected depth of the core gap in th e second hole.

Subsequently, once thermal equilibration was reached and WRMSL and SHMSL measurement s were completed, the raw physical properties data and core images were downloaded using th e Correlation Downloader software or directly from the LIMS database. One exception was GR A density, where we filtered and removed data ${<}1\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ (i.e., the density of water) from the data set s because these were considered spurious.  

The magnetic susceptibility, GRA density, NGR, paleomagnetic inclination, and $L^{\ast}$ data wer e imported into the Correlator software (version 4.0) to refine the composite depth scale and splice. Core images were a useful tool to validate the position of tie points, particularly when the physica l properties data indicate lithologic transitions, which naturally are sensible tie points.  

# 8.8.1. Composite depth scale  

The aim of a composite depth scale (CCSF) is to place coeval, laterally continuous stratigraphi c features into a common frame of reference by shifting the depths of individual cores from the original CSF-A scale to the CCSF scale (Figure F26). In generating the composite depth scale, the rul e was to shift the depths of individual cores by a constant amount (affine transformation). Core-bycore depth shifting does not permit corrections for expansion or contraction within cores. Thi s method provides good first-order correlation between cores from different holes without addin g more subjective and potentially erroneous interpretations. It preserves the actual relationshi p between curated core sections and the depth scale. Thus, the established CCSF scale provides  a basis upon which higher order depth composite scales can be built.  

The CCSF scale was built by assuming that the uppermost sediment (mudline) in the first cor e from a given hole is the sediment/water interface. This core becomes the anchor in the composit e depth scale and was the only core in which depths are the same on both the CSF-A and CCS F scales. From this anchor, correlative features in physical properties core logging data were correlated between holes downsection. The selection of correlation tie points was highly subjective, but selections are made to optimize correlation of specific features that will later define splic e intervals. It was impossible to align all correlative features of a single physical property data type o r multiple data types within cores without drastic and irregular squeezing or stretching depth intervals. The appearance of apparently compressed or expanded intervals when comparing cores fro m different holes may reflect small-scale differences in sedimentation and/or distortion caused b y the coring and archiving processes. The depth offset of every core per hole was tabulated in a n affine table for every site and uploaded to the LIMS database using the SCORS uploader.  

![](images/79640282e7636a2f90ba1576446eb9bf8974d308919287ba1deb391ea1d42a66.jpg)  
Figure F26. Schematic of cored material, compositing, and generation of a composite section or “splice,” Expeditio n 390/393. CSF-A depth scale was created by combining DSF depth with curated core length. APC recovery was typicall y $>\!100\%$ due to expansion of cored material (orange bars), hence there is overlap between cores. CCSF depth scale resolve s this; we found common stratigraphic features within multiple holes (tie points, red lines) and shifted depths of individua l cores relative to each other (compositing), aligning the cores, and thus creating a vertical offset between CSF-A and CCS F depth scales for each core. A composite record (Hole A and B) or a splice was constructed using selected intervals betwee n tie points to avoid coring gaps, which provides a continuous section of recovered core material.  

Because of core expansion, the CCSF depths of stratigraphic intervals are typically $10\%{-}15\%$ deeper than their CSF-A depths. CCSF depth scale construction also reveals that coring gaps o n the order of $1.0–1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ typically occur between two subsequent cores, despite the apparent $>\!100\%$ recovery. During the process of constructing the composite section, the CCSF depth become s systematically deeper than that of the CSF-A depth for equivalent horizons. This expansion ha s four main causes:  

• Decompression of the sediment as it is brought to atmospheric pressure; • Pore-space gases coming out of solution, warming, and expanding; • Stretching that occurs as part of the coring process; and/or • Recovering borehole wall sediment that fell downhole and was cored.  

# 8.8.2. Splice  

For each site a splice was generated, where core sections from adjacent holes were combined t o minimize coring gaps for each site (Figure F26). The placement of splice tie points was inherentl y subjective, but we used the following guidelines for splice construction:  

• The top and bottom $^{1\,}\mathbf{m}$ of cores, where drilling disturbance was more likely, were typically avoided.   
• Caution was taken during compositing and splicing within the uppermost 2 cores at every site to avoid artifacts caused by entrainment and duplication of loose sediment at the top of the hole because of imperfect alignment of the “shot” core barrels.   
• We routinely attempted to avoid intervals of cores from holes where whole-round samples for IW, microbiological, and geochemistry samples were taken to maximize the possibility of still generating a spliced continuous sediment record for postexpedition sampling.   
• We attempted to select portions of core that were the most representative of the stratigraphic section using all the physical properties data sets and core images at our disposal.  

# 8.9. Downhole measurements  

The downhole measurements made during the SAT expeditions included formation temperatur e measurements during APC coring operations at all sites, as well as downhole logging in most o f the basement holes.  

Downhole logs are measurements used to assess the physical, chemical, and structural propertie s of the formation surrounding a borehole that are made by lowering sondes with an electrical wireline in the hole after completion of drilling. The data are continuously acquired with depth (a t vertical sampling intervals ranging from $2.5~\mathrm{mm}$ to $15\;\mathrm{cm}$ ) and measured in situ. Downhole log s measure formation properties on a scale that is intermediate between those obtained from laboratory measurements on core samples and those from geophysical surveys. They are useful in calibrating the interpretation of geophysical data and provide a link for the integrated understandin g of physical properties on a wide range of scales.  

Downhole logs can be interpreted in terms of the stratigraphy, lithology, mineralogy, magneti c characteristics, and geochemical composition of the penetrated formation. They also provid e information on the condition, shape, and size of the borehole and on possible deformatio n induced by drilling or formation stress. In intervals where core recovery is incomplete or disturbed, log data may provide the only way to characterize the formation and can be used to determine the actual thickness of individual units or lithologies when contacts are not recovered, t o pinpoint the actual depth of features in cores with incomplete recovery, or to identify and characterize intervals that were not recovered. Where core recovery is good, log and core data complement one another and may be interpreted jointly.  

# 8.9.1. Wireline logging operations  

During wireline logging operations, logs are recorded with a variety of tools combined into too l strings, which are lowered into the hole after completion of coring operations. Three primar y tool strings were used during Expeditions 390 and 393 (Figure F27): the Triple combination (triple combo), which measures spectral and natural gamma radiation, porosity, density, resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility; the Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic string, which provide s high-resolution resistivity images of the borehole wall and sonic velocities; and the Ultrasoni c Borehole Imager (UBI), which provides acoustic images of the borehole wall. Each tool string als o contains a telemetry cartridge for communicating through the wireline to the Schlumberger dat a acquisition system on the drillship. Individual tools, measurements, and units are listed in Table s T7 and T8.

In preparation for logging, the boreholes were flushed of debris by circulating viscous drilling flui d and filled with seawater or seawater-based logging gel (sepiolite mud mixed with seawater an d weighted with barite; approximate density $=10.5\,\mathrm{lb/gal}$ or $1.258\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ ) to help stabilize the borehole walls. After completion of coring, the bottom of the drill string was set high enough above th e bottom of the casing for the longest tool string to fit inside the casing before entering the ope n hole. The tool strings were then lowered downhole on a seven-conductor wireline cable durin g sequential deployments. The gamma ray tool and in some cases the sonic tool are the only tool s that provide meaningful data inside the drill pipe or casing (mostly qualitative). Such data are use d primarily to identify the depth of seafloor and the sediment/basement boundary but can also b e used for stratigraphic characterization.  

Each tool string deployment is a logging run, starting with the assembly of the tool string and an y necessary calibrations. The tool string is then lowered to the bottom of the hole while recording  a partial set of data, and then it is pulled up at a constant speed (typically $250{-}500\ \mathrm{m/h})$ to recor d the main data. During each run, tool strings can be lowered down and pulled up the hole severa l times for repeatability or to try to improve the data quality. Each lowering or raising of a tool strin g while collecting data constitutes a pass. During each pass the incoming data are recorded an d monitored in real time on the surface minimum configuration multitasking acquisition and imaging system (MAXIS). A logging run is complete once a tool string has been recovered to the ri g floor and disassembled. A wireline heave compensator (WHC) was employed to minimize th e effect of ship’s heave on the tool string’s position in the borehole (see below).  

# 8.9.2. Logged properties and tool measurement principles  

The primary logging measurements recorded during Expeditions 390 and 393 are listed in Tabl e T7. The logged properties and the principles used in the tools that measure them are briefl y described below. More detailed information on individual tools and their geologic application s may be found in Serra (1984, 1986, 1989), Schlumberger (1989, 1994), Rider (1996), Goldber g (1997), Lovell et al. (1998), and Ellis and Singer (2007). A complete online list of acronyms for th e Schlumberger tools and measurement curves is available at https://www.apps.slb.com/cmd.  

# 8.9.2.1. Natural radioactivity  

The Hostile Environment Natural Gamma Ray Sonde (HNGS) was used on all tool strings to measure natural radioactivity in the formation. The HNGS uses two bismuth germanate scintillatio n detectors and five-window spectroscopy to determine concentrations of potassium (in weight percent), thorium (in parts per million), and uranium (in parts per million) from the characteristi c gamma ray energies of isotopes in the $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}_{:}$ , and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ radioactive decay series, which dominat e the natural radiation spectrum. The computation of the elemental abundances uses a least-square s method of extracting U, Th, and K elemental concentrations from the spectral measurements. Th e HNGS filters out gamma ray energies below $500\;\mathrm{keV},$ eliminating sensitivity to bentonite or KCl i n the drilling mud and improving measurement accuracy. The HNGS also provides a measure of th e total spectral gamma ray (HSGR) emission measured in American Petroleum Institute gamm a radiation units (gAPI). The HNGS response is influenced by the borehole diameter, and therefor e HNGS data are corrected for borehole diameter variations during acquisition.

The Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC; see Auxiliary logging equipment), a telemetry cartridge used primarily to communicate data to the surface, includes a sodium iodide scintillation detector that also measures the total natural gamma ray (NGR) emission. It is not a spectra l tool but it provides high-resolution total gamma ray for each pass, which allows precise dept h match processing between logging runs and passes.  

# 8.9.2.2. Porosity  

Formation porosity was measured with the Accelerator Porosity Sonde (APS). The sonde include s a minitron neutron generator that produces fast $(14.4\;\mathrm{MeV})$ neutrons and five neutron detector s (four epithermal and one thermal) positioned at different spacing from the minitron. The tool’ s detectors count neutrons that arrive at the detectors after being scattered and slowed by collision s with atomic nuclei in the formation.

The highest energy loss occurs when neutrons collide with hydrogen nuclei, which have practicall y the same mass as the neutron (the neutrons bounce off heavier elements without losing muc h energy). If the hydrogen (i.e., water) concentration is low, as in low-porosity formations, neutron s can travel farther before being captured and the count rates increase at the detector. The opposit e effect occurs in high-porosity formations where the water content is high. The raw porosity valu e is often an overestimate because hydrogen bound in minerals such as clays or in hydrocarbons als o contributes to the measurement.  

Upon reaching thermal energies $(0.025\mathrm{~eV})$ ), the neutrons are captured by the nuclei of Cl, Si, B, and other elements, resulting in a gamma ray emission. This neutron capture cross section $(\Sigma_{\mathrm{f}})$ i s also measured by the tool.  

# 8.9.2.3. Density  

Formation density was measured with the Hostile Environment Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS). Th e sonde contains a radioactive cesium $(^{137}\mathrm{Cs})$ gamma ray source $(622\,\mathrm{keV})$ and far- and near-gamm a ray detectors mounted on a shielded skid, which is pressed against the borehole wall by a hydraulically activated decentralizing arm. Gamma rays emitted by the source undergo Compton scattering, where gamma rays are scattered by electrons in the formation. The number of scattere d gamma rays that reach the detectors is proportional to the density of electrons in the formation, which is in turn related to bulk density. Porosity may also be derived from this bulk density if th e matrix (grain) density is known.  

The HLDS also measures the photoelectric effect (PEF), a measure of the photoelectric absorptio n of low-energy gamma radiation. Photoelectric absorption occurs when gamma ray energy fall s below $150\;\mathrm{keV}$ as a result of being repeatedly scattered by electrons in the formation. Because PE F depends on the atomic number of the elements in the formation (heavier elements have highe r PEF), it also varies according to the chemical composition of the minerals.  

Good contact between the tool and borehole wall is essential for good HLDS logs. Poor contac t results in underestimation of density values. Both the density correction and caliper measuremen t of the hole are used to check the contact quality.  

# 8.9.2.4. Electrical resistivity  

The High-Resolution Laterolog Array (HRLA) provides six electrical resistivity measurement s with different depths of investigation (including the borehole, or mud, resistivity and five measurements of formation resistivity with increasing penetration into the formation). The sonde sends  a focused current into the formation and measures the intensity necessary to maintain a constan t drop in voltage across a fixed interval, providing direct resistivity measurements. The array ha s one central source electrode and six electrodes above and below it, which serve alternatively a s focusing and returning current electrodes. By rapidly changing the role of these electrodes,  a simultaneous resistivity measurement at six penetration depths is achieved. The tool is designe d to ensure that all signals are measured at exactly the same time and tool position and to reduce th e sensitivity to “shoulder bed” effects when crossing sharp beds thinner than the electrode spacing. The HRLA needs to be run centralized in the borehole for optimal results, so knuckle joints wer e used to centralize the HRLA while allowing the density and porosity tools that are often on th e same tool string to maintain good contact with the borehole wall.  

Typically, minerals found in sedimentary and crustal rocks are electrical insulators, whereas ioni c solutions like pore water are conductors. In most rocks, electrical conduction occurs primarily b y ion transport through pore fluids and is strongly dependent on the porosity, the types of pores an d connectivity, the permeability, and the pore fluid.  

# 8.9.2.5. Magnetic susceptibility  

The Magnetic Susceptibility Sonde (MSS) is a nonstandard wireline tool designed by LamontDoherty Earth Observatory (LDEO). It measures the ease with which formations are magnetize d when subjected to a magnetic field. The ease of magnetization, or susceptibility, is ultimatel y related to the concentration and composition (size, shape, and mineralogy) of magnetic mineral s in the formation. These measurements provide one of the best methods for investigating stratigraphic changes in mineralogy and lithology because the measurement is quick, repeatable, an d nondestructive and because different lithologies often have strongly contrasting susceptibilities. The data can be compared to the susceptibility measurements made on the recovered core by th e WRMSL and the MSP measurements of the SHMSL (see Whole-round core section measurements).  

The MSS dual-coil sensor provides ${\sim}40\;\mathrm{cm}$ resolution measurements with ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{cm}$ depth of horizontal investigation. The MSS was run as the lowermost tool in the triple combo tool string usin g a specially developed data translation cartridge to enable the MSS to be run in combination wit h the Schlumberger tools. MSS data are plotted as uncalibrated units and are affected by temperature and borehole size. For quality control and environmental correction, the MSS also measure s internal tool temperature, $z_{\cdot}$ -axis acceleration, and low-resolution borehole conductivity.  

# 8.9.2.6. Acoustic velocity  

The Dipole Shear Sonic Imager (DSI) measures the transit times between sonic transmitters an d an array of eight receivers. The waveforms are then used to calculate the sonic velocity in the formation. The omnidirectional monopole transmitter emits high frequency $(5{-}15~\mathrm{kHz})$ pulses t o extract the compressional velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ of the formation, as well as the shear velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{{S}}}\right)$ when it i s faster than the sound velocity in the borehole fluid. It combines replicate measurements, thus providing a direct $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ measurement through sediments that is relatively free from the effects of formation damage or an enlarged borehole (Schlumberger, 1989). The same transmitter can be fired i n sequence at a lower frequency $(0.5{-}1~\mathrm{kHz})$ to generate Stoneley waves that are sensitive to fractures and variations in permeability. Along with the monopole transmitters found on most soni c tools, the DSI also has two crossed-dipole transmitters that allow an additional $V_{\mathrm{{S}}}$ measurement.  

# 8.9.2.7. Acoustic images  

Acoustic images of the borehole wall were generated from measurements taken by the UBI. Th e UBI features a high-resolution transducer, which emits ultrasonic pulses at a frequency of 250 an d $500\,\mathrm{kHz}$ (low and high resolution, respectively) that are reflected by the borehole surface and the n received by the same transducer recording the amplitude and traveltime of the reflected signal. Continuous rotation of the transducer combined with the upward motion of the tool result in  a $360^{\circ}$ image of the borehole wall. The amplitude of the signal depends on the reflection coefficien t of the borehole fluid/borehole wall interface, the position of the UBI tool in the borehole, th e shape of the borehole, and the roughness of the borehole wall. Modulation of the reflected signa l is dependent on the borehole wall roughness. Therefore, fractures or other changes in the character of the drilled formation (e.g., grain size and texture) can be recognized in the amplitude image. The recorded traveltime image gives detailed information about the cross-sectional shape of th e borehole, which allows calculation of one caliper value (radius) of the borehole from each traveltime measurement. These amplitude and traveltime measurements are recorded in combinatio n with an azimuthal measurement (from the General Purpose Inclinometry Tool [GPIT]), permitting orientation of these images. The full coverage of UBI measurements make the images a usefu l tool for core orientation and for stress analysis (Paillet and Kim, 1987).  

# 8.9.2.8. Microresistivity images  

The FMS provides high-resolution electrical resistivity–based images of the borehole walls tha t can be used for detailed lithostratigraphic or structural interpretation. The tool has four orthogonally oriented arms, each with 16 button electrodes that are pressed against the borehole wall s during logging. The electrodes are arranged in two diagonally offset rows of 8 electrodes each.  A focused current is emitted from the button electrodes into the formation, with a return electrod e near the top of the tool. Resistivity of the formation at the button electrodes is derived from th e intensity of current passing through the button electrodes.  

Processing transforms the resistivity measurements into oriented high-resolution images tha t reveal geologic structures of the borehole wall based on their conductivity. Features such as bedding, stratification, fracturing, slump folding, and bioturbation can be resolved (Luthi, 1990; Salimullah and Stow, 1992; Lovell et al., 1998). Because the images are oriented to magnetic north, further analysis can provide measurement of the dip and direction (azimuth) of planar features i n the formation. In addition, when the corresponding planar features can be identified in the recovered core samples, individual core pieces can be reoriented with respect to true north.  

The maximum extension of the FMS caliper arms is $40.6\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ (16 inches). In holes with a diamete r greater than this maximum, the pad contact at the end of the caliper arms will be inconsistent an d the FMS images may appear out of focus and too conductive. Irregular (rough) borehole walls wil l also adversely affect the images if contact with the wall is poor. Approximately $30\%$ of a borehol e with a diameter of $25\;\mathrm{cm}$ is imaged during a single pass. Standard procedure is to make two ful l uphole passes with the FMS to maximize the borehole coverage with the pads.  

# 8.9.2.9. Acceleration and inclinometry  

The GPIT makes three-component acceleration and magnetic field measurements. The primar y purpose of this tool is to determine the acceleration and orientation of the tool string in which it i s deployed. Tool orientation is defined by three parameters: tool deviation, tool azimuth, and relative bearing. The GPIT uses a three-axis inclinometer and a three-axis fluxgate magnetometer t o record the orientation of the logging tool as the magnetometer records the magnetic field components $\operatorname{Fx},$ Fy, and Fz). The resulting data can be used to facilitate corrections for irregular too l motion and to provide oriented image data from the FMS and UBI tools. Corrections for cabl e stretching and/or ship heave using GPIT acceleration data (Ax, Ay, and Az) allow precise determinations of log depths.  

# 8.9.2.10. Auxiliary logging equipment  

The Schlumberger logging equipment head (LEH, or cablehead) measures tension at the very to p of the wireline tool string, which diagnoses difficulties in running the tool string up or down th e borehole or when exiting or entering the drilling string or casing.  

Telemetry cartridges are used in each tool string to allow transmission of the data from the tool s to the surface. The EDTC also includes a sodium iodide scintillation detector to measure the tota l natural gamma ray emission of the formation. This gamma ray log was used to match the depth s between the different passes and runs. In addition, it includes an accelerometer, and that data ca n be used in real time to evaluate the efficiency of the WHC.  

Because the tool strings combine tools of different generations and with various designs, the y include several adapters and joints between individual tools to allow communication, provide isolation, avoid interferences (mechanical, acoustic), terminate wirings, or to position the tool properly in the borehole. The knuckle joints, in particular, were used to allow some of the tools such a s the HRLA to remain centralized in the borehole, whereas the overlying HLDS was pressed agains t the borehole wall.  

All these additions are included and contribute to the total length of the tool strings in Figure F27.  

# 8.9.3. Log data quality  

The condition of a borehole is the principal factor contributing to log data quality. The ideal conditions for logging include a consistent borehole diameter of the size of the bit with no washouts o r bridges. Oversized borehole diameters can have a significant impact on measurements, especiall y those that require tool eccentering (e.g., HLDS) or tool centralization (e.g., FMS and UBI). Th e measurement principles of the eccentered tools, as well as the centralized FMS, means that direc t contact with the formation is essential for the acquisition of high-quality data. The UBI is a noncontact tool, but data quality is best when the tool is actively centered in the borehole. Deep investigation measurements such as gamma radiation, resistivity, and sonic velocity, which do no t require contact with the borehole wall, are generally less sensitive to borehole conditions, although data are optimized in boreholes where the tools can be centralized (up to ${\sim}20$ inch diameter).  

If the borehole diameter varies over short intervals because of washouts of softer material o r ledges of harder material, the logs from tools that require good contact with the borehole wall (i.e., FMS, density, and porosity tools) may be degraded. Bridged sections, where the borehole diamete r is significantly less than the bit size, will also cause irregular log results. The quality of the borehol e can be improved by minimizing the circulation of drilling fluid while drilling, flushing the borehole to remove debris prior to logging, and logging as soon after drilling and conditioning a s possible.  

The quality of the wireline depth determination depends on several factors. The depth of the logging measurements is determined from the length of the cable spooled out from the winch on th e ship. Uncertainties in logging depth occur because of ship heave, cable stretch, cable slip, and tida l changes. To minimize the wireline tool motion caused by ship heave, a hydraulic WHC was use d to adjust the wireline depth for rig motion during wireline logging operations (see Wireline heav e compensator). The seafloor is identified on the gamma ray log by the abrupt reduction in gamm a ray count at the water/sediment interface (mudline), an important reference datum for matchin g logging depths and providing depth consistency across all logging data. Discrepancies between th e drilling core depth and wireline logging depth may occur because of core expansion, incomplet e core recovery, incomplete heave compensation, and drill pipe stretch. Reconciling the difference s between the two data sets is possible through comparison of the common data sets acquired i n situ and on core (e.g., magnetic susceptibility and NGR).  

# 8.9.4. Wireline heave compensator  

During wireline logging operations, the up-and-down motion of the ship (heave) causes a simila r motion of the downhole logging tools. If the amplitude of this motion is large, depth discrepancie s can be introduced into the logging data. The risk of damaging downhole instruments is als o increased. A WHC system was designed to compensate for the vertical motion of the ship an d maintain a steady motion of the logging tools to ensure high-quality logging data acquisition (Iturrino et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013). The WHC uses a vertical accelerometer (motion reference uni t [MRU]) positioned under the rig floor near the ship’s center of gravity to calculate the vertica l motion of the ship with respect to the seafloor. It then adjusts the length of the wireline by varyin g the distance between two sets of pulleys through which the cable passes in order to minimiz e downhole tool motion.  

# 8.9.5. Logging data flow and depth scales  

Data for each wireline logging run were monitored in real time and recorded using the Schlumberger surface acquisition system. Data were shortly thereafter transferred onshore to LDEO fo r standardized data processing, formatting for the online logging database, and archiving. Processe d data were returned to the ship and made available to the shipboard scientists within a few days o f logging.  

The processing included several stages. First, using the gamma ray logs recorded by every too l string, a visually interactive program was used to match the depths of recognizable features acros s all the passes to a reference curve, commonly the gamma ray log of the longest upward pass. Imag e data (FMS and UBI) were also processed to correct the effects of irregular tool motion using th e acceleration data from the GPIT. After depth matching, all the logging depths were shifted fro m the rig floor depth reference (in which they were initially recorded) to a seafloor depth reference, based on the seafloor as identified by the step in gamma radiation at the sediment/water interface. All the processed data were made available in ASCII and DLIS formats for most logs and in GIF fo r the images.  

# 8.10. In situ temperature measurements  

During all SAT expeditions, in situ formation temperature measurements were made at selecte d depths in the sediments at all sites to assess the thermal structure of the sedimentary section alon g the transect and measure the regional heat flow.  

The APCT-3 tool fits directly into a modified coring shoe of the APC and consists of a batter y pack, data logger, and a platinum resistance-temperature device calibrated over a temperatur e range of $0^{\circ}{-}30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$ . Before entering the borehole, the tool is stopped at the seafloor for $5{-}10\;\mathrm{min}$ t o thermally equilibrate with bottom water. However, the lowest temperature recorded during th e run down is preferred to the average temperature at the seafloor as an estimate of bottom wate r temperature because (1) this measurement is more repeatable and (2) the bottom water i s expected to have the lowest temperature in the profile. After the APC penetrated the sediment, i t was held in place for ${\sim}10$ min as the APCT-3 tool recorded the temperature of the cutting sho e every second. When the APC was fired into the formation, there was typically an instantaneou s temperature rise due to frictional heating. The heat gradually dissipated into the surrounding sediment as the temperature at the APCT-3 tool equilibrated toward the temperature of the sediment.  

The equilibrium temperature of the sediment was estimated by applying a mathematical heatconduction model to the temperature decay record (Horai and Von Herzen, 1985). The syntheti c thermal decay curve for the APCT-3 tool is a function of the geometry and thermal properties o f the probe and the sediment (Bullard, 1954; Horai and Von Herzen, 1985). The equilibrium temperature must be estimated by applying a fitting procedure in the TP-Fit software (Heesemann e t al., 2006). However, when the APC system did not achieve a full stroke or when ship heave pulle d up the APC system from full penetration, the temperature equilibration curve was disturbed an d temperature determination was less accurate. The nominal accuracy of the APCT-3 tool temperature measurements is $\pm0.05^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

# 8.11. Heat flow  

A simple estimation of the vertical conductive heat flow at each site can be made by calculating  a least-squares linear fit of the measured formation temperature as a function of depth. The slope o f this linear fit is the temperature gradient, and the local vertical conductive heat flow is the produc t of this gradient with the mean thermal conductivity measured in the sediments from this site.  

Another measure of the heat flow in a conductive regime can be established with a Bullard plo t (Bullard, 1939). If the vertical heat flow (q) is assumed constant with depth, such as in a predominantly conductive regime, the temperature at depth $\boldsymbol{z}$ can be calculated by a simple integration:  

$$
T\,=\,T_{0}+q\cdot\Bigl\lbrack_{0}^{z}\frac{d z}{K(z)}\,,
$$  

where $T_{0}$ is the temperature at the seafloor and $\mathrm{K}(z)$ the thermal conductivity at a depth $z$ . Th e value in the integral is the thermal resistance of the interval between the seafloor and $z.$ . If the hea t flow is constant with depth, as in a conductive regime, this defines a linear relationship betwee n temperature and thermal resistance, and its slope is the conductive heat flow (Bullard, 1939).  

# 9. Geochemistry  

Shipboard geochemistry data routinely collected during the SAT expeditions (390C, 395E, 390, and 393) included headspace analysis of hydrocarbon gases, in situ pore water oxygen measurements, IW chemistry (e.g., salinity, $\mathsf{p H}$ , alkalinity, major cations and anions, nutrients, major an d minor elements), loss on ignition (LOI), total carbon (TC) and total inorganic carbon (TIC), an d elemental compositions of basement rocks using both ICP-AES and XRF using a handheld portable instrument (pXRF). During Expedition 390, sulfide concentrations in IW were also determined. All data generated during shipboard analyses have been uploaded to the LIMS database. This combination of analyses provides insight into biogeochemical processes including metaboli c rates, abiotic diagenetic reactions, mineral alteration (e.g., authigenic mineral precipitation an d water-rock interactions), and advective fluid migration.  

# 9.1. Headspace analysis of hydrocarbon gases  

During Expeditions 390C and 395E and at Site U1583 during Expedition 393, headspace hydrocarbon analyses were conducted as part of standard shipboard safety monitoring procedures, a s described in Kvenvolden and McDonald (1986) and Pimmel and Claypool (2001), to prevent drilling into sediments that contain hydrocarbon concentrations above safety levels. One sample pe r sediment core was subjected to headspace hydrocarbon gas analysis.  

The $\sim\!3{-}5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sediment sample was collected from the interior of a freshly exposed core directl y after sectioning on the catwalk. This sample was placed in a $20~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ glass vial and sealed with  a Teflon/silicon septum and a crimped aluminum cap. The headspace sample was typically taken a t the top of Section 4 (below the IW sample), unless obvious core disturbance suggested that a different section should be selected. The sample was placed in the oven at $80^{\circ}C$ for $30\;\mathrm{min}$ . A $5\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ aliquot of the evolved hydrocarbon gases was extracted from the headspace vial with a standar d gas syringe and then manually injected into an Agilent 7890 Series II gas chromatograph (GC ) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) set at $250^{\circ}C$ . The column ( $2\;\mathrm{mm}$ inner diameter, $6.3\:\mathrm{mm}$ outer diameter) was packed with 80/100 mesh HayeSep T (Restek). The GC oven progra m was set to stay at $80^{\circ}C$ for $8.25\;\mathrm{min}$ with a subsequent heat-up to $150^{\circ}C$ at $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ . The total ru n time was $15\;\mathrm{min}$ .  

Results were collected using the Hewlett Packard 3365 ChemStation software. The chromatographic response was calibrated using nine different gas standard analyses and checked daily. Th e concentration of the analyzed hydrocarbon gases was reported as parts per million by volum e (ppmv).

# 9.2. Interstitial water collection and analysis  

During the SAT expeditions, IW was extracted (1) through squeezing of whole round core sample s that were cut on the catwalk (all expeditions including 390C and 395E) and (2) at a higher resolution on entire sections of core using Rhizon samplers during Expeditions 390 and 393 to enable  a wide range of shipboard analyses and for postexpedition research (Table T9). The residual wholeround sediments after IW extraction (squeeze cakes) were sampled for shipboard inorganic carbon and total carbon analyses as well as for postexpedition research.

# 9.2.1. IW sampling from sediment squeezing  

Whole round samples $5{-}20\;\mathrm{cm}$ in length for IW extraction were cut on the catwalk, immediatel y capped, and then transferred to the chemistry laboratory for squeezing. The surfaces of eac h whole-round sample were carefully scraped away under ambient laboratory conditions usin g stainless steel knives to remove contamination due to seawater, drilling disturbances, and/or sediment smearing along the insides of the core liners. More exterior material was removed from XC B cores because XCB coring can result in more significant physical disturbance and seawater contamination in the core liner. The remaining sediments were transferred to titanium squeezers an d loaded into a Carver hydraulic laboratory press (Manheim and Sayles, 1974). The sediments wer e squeezed to extract IW at pressures up to 25,000 lb $({\sim}24.3\,\mathrm{MPa})$ ). A minimum of $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$ of squeezing was required for all cores; up to $2~\mathrm{{h}}$ of squeezing was required to extract sufficient IW fro m some XCB cores because sediments collected with the XCB system are generally more compacted. IW extracted in the squeezers was passed through a nanopure water-precleaned Whatman Number 1 filter above a titanium screen into a $60~\mathrm{mL}$ high-density polyethylene (HDPE) syringe tha t had been acid-cleaned with $10\%$ HCl. For Expedition 393, two stacked Whatman Number 1 filter s were used to reduce the particulates passing through to the syringe. For all expeditions, a $0.45\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ polyethersulfone membrane filter was attached to the syringe tip upon collection of IW from th e squeezers. The collected fluids were then filtered through a $0.2\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ polyethersulfone membran e filter into appropriate containers and processed for shipboard and postexpedition analyses. Th e squeeze cake residues were then subsampled for postexpedition research and shipboard carbonat e and total carbon analyses. The residual squeeze cakes were stored at $4^{\circ}C$ . Squeezers were cleane d between samples with tap water, rinsed with $18.2\,\mathrm{M}\Omega$ deionized water, and dried with compresse d air before further sample processing.

# 9.2.2.1. Salinity, pH, and alkalinity  

Salinity, alkalinity, and $\mathsf{p H}$ were measured immediately on IW extracted from squeezing followin g the procedures in Gieskes et al. (1991). Hole U1558D IW salinity was measured on a temperaturecompensated digital refractometer (Index Instruments Ltd.) Salinity measurements for Hol e U1558F were consistently offset by 1 salinity unit and were corrected to reflect this drift. Th e instrument began to drift to higher values and could not be recalibrated. For subsequent holes, measurements were made with a Fisher Model S66366 optical refractometer. International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) standard seawater (salinity $=35$ ) and 18. 2 MΩ water (salinity $=0$ ) were used to calibrate salinity. During Expeditions 390C and 395E, salinit y was also measured using a Metrohm 785 DMP chloride autotitrator; a $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ sample was titrate d against $0.015\;\mathrm{M}$ silver nitrate solution. IW pH and alkalinity were determined using a Metroh m 794 Basic Titrino autotitrator with a glass $\mathsf{p H}$ electrode. A $3\;\mathrm{mL}$ sample was titrated against $0.1\,\mathrm{M}$ HCl at $25\mathrm{{^\circC}}$ to reach an endpoint of $\mathrm{pH}=4.2$ . The IAPSO standard seawater (alkalinity $=2.325$ mM; certified value) and laboratory standards $(5\mathrm{-}100\mathrm{\mM\,Na_{2}C O_{3}}$ alkalinity, made by mixing different proportions of $0.7\ \mathrm{M\KCl}+0.1\ \mathrm{M\Na_{2}C O_{3}})$ were used for calibration. The IAPSO standar d was analyzed at the beginning and end of the sequence and after every 10 samples. Repeated measurements of IAPSO seawater for alkalinity yielded precision better than $2.5\%$ .  

# 9.2.2.2. Major cations and anions  

Sulfate $\left(\mathrm{SO_{4}}\right)$ , chloride (Cl), bromide (Br), sodium (Na), magnesium $\left(\mathrm{Mg}\right)$ , potassium (K), and calcium $(\mathbf{Ca})$ concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatography (Metrohm 850 Professional IC ) using $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of IW diluted by 100 times with $18.2~\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water. For anions (Cl, $\mathrm{SO}_{4},$ and Br),  a Metrosep C6 column ( $100\;\mathrm{mm}$ long; $4\,\mathrm{mm}$ inner diameter) was used with $3.2\,\mathrm{mM}$ $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ and 1. 0 mM $\small\mathrm{1\NaHCO_{3}}$ solutions as eluents, whereas a Metrosep A supp 7 column ( $150\ \mathrm{mm}$ long; $4~\mathrm{mm}$ inner diameter) was used with $1.7\mathrm{\mM\HNO_{3}}$ and pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (PDCA) solutions as eluents for cations $(\mathrm{Na},\,\mathrm{K},\,\mathrm{Mg},$ and $C\mathbf{a}$ ). The standards were IAPSO in various dilution s (ranging from $150\%$ to $1\%$ IAPSO) to create a 9-point calibration curve. Reproducibility wa s checked on the repeated measurements of standard IAPSO and IAPSO dilution of 1:10 every 1 0 samples. Reproducibility (defined by standard deviation/average; relative standard deviatio n [RSD]) of repeated IAPSO measurements $\left(N=16\right)$ was better than $1.5\%$ for $\mathrm{Cl}$ , $\mathrm{SO}_{4},$ Na, Mg, K, and Br, whereas for $C a^{2+}$ it was $3.5\%$ for Expedition 390 and $<\!1.8\%$ for Ca for Expedition 393.  

Recoveries of most cations and anions were within $100\%\pm3\%$ except for $C\mathbf{a}$ $(93\%{-}104\%)$ ). Table T9 lists precision and detection limits for our ion chromatographic measurements.  

# 9.2.2.3. Spectrophotometric analysis of ammonium, phosphate, and sulfide  

Shipboard analyses of dissolved ammonium $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}\right)$ and phosphate $\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{\;\;3-}\right)$ were performed on a n Agilent Technologies Cary Series 100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer with a sipper sample introduction system, following Gieskes et al. (1991). Ammonium concentrations were determined using  a colorimetric method measured at $640\;\mathrm{nm}$ , which incorporates diazotization of phenol and subsequent oxidation of the diazo compound by Clorox to yield a blue color. During Expedition 390, tw o calibration curves were used to better quantify the low-concentration range: the regular 9-poin t calibration curve (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 400, 600, 800, and $1000\;\upmu\mathrm{M})$ run at both Sites U1556 an d U1559 and a 6-point low-concentration calibration (10, 20, 40, 80, 120, and $160\;\upmu\mathrm{M})$ run at Sit e U1559. Check standards were run every 10 samples. The solution was kept at room temperatur e for ${\sim}6.5\mathrm{~h~}$ to develop color after adding the reagents. Recoveries for check standards (50 and 40 0 $\upmu\mathrm{M}$ for Hole U1556C, 20 and $100\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ for Hole U1559D) are generally better than $90\%$ . Because o f contamination issues, the ammonium concentrations from Expedition 390C were not reported. During Expeditions 390 and 393, ammonium was also measured on a third-party Tecan Spar k 10M Multimode plate reader to test the feasibility of using a microplate reader during expeditions. Samples and reagents were pipetted into 96-well polystyrene plates. Sample and reagent volume s were in the same proportions as those used for shipboard colorimetric method analysis of ammonium but were reduced by a factor of 20 to accommodate relatively smaller $350\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ well volumes o f the plate. The reagent volumes were the same for both expeditions, but samples from Hol e U1583A were prepared without dilution to improve analytical sensitivity for low-concentratio n samples. The sample-reagent mixture was kept at room temperature for ${\sim}6.5\,\mathrm{h}$ for full color development. Absorbance was measured at $640\,\mathrm{nm}$ in the plate reader, and sample concentrations wer e corrected to a 7-point calibration curve (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 400, and $600\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$ . The high standar d bracketed the highest ammonium concentrations measured during the expeditions. Check standards were run every 10 samples.  

Phosphate concentrations were measured through the reaction of orthophosphate with $\mathrm{Mo}(\mathrm{VI})$ and Sb(III) in an acidic solution to form an antimony-phosphomolybdate complex that was the n reduced by ascorbic acid to form a blue color. After adding the mixed reagent solution and lettin g the samples react for $30\;\mathrm{min}$ , the absorbance was measured at $885~\mathrm{nm}$ (Gieskes et al., 1991). A 9- point calibration curve (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60, 80, and $100\ \upmu\mathrm{M})$ ) was used, and check standard s were run every 10 samples. Recoveries for check standards (10 and $20\;\upmu\mathrm{M})$ were generally bette r than $90\%$ . Because of contamination issues, the phosphate concentrations from Expedition 390 C were not reported. Phosphate was also measured on the third-party Tecan Spark 10M Multimod e plate reader during Expeditions 390 and 393. Sample and reagent volumes were reduced by a factor of 20 to accommodate the well volume of the polystyrene plates. The reagent volumes were th e same for both expeditions, but samples from Hole U1583A were prepared without dilution t o improve analytical sensitivity. The sample-reagent mixture was kept at room temperature for 3 0 min to allow color development. Absorbance was measured at $885~\mathrm{nm}$ on the microplate reader, and sample concentrations were corrected to a calibration curve. Check standards were ru n approximately every 10 samples. Table T9 lists the precision and detection limits for nutrien t analyses.  

Total sulfides $\left(\Sigma\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{S}\,=\,\mathrm{S}^{2-}\,+\,\mathrm{HS}^{-}\,+\,\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{S}\right)$ in IW samples were measured colorimetrically on th e third-party Tecan Spark 10M Multimode plate reader. Zinc acetate solution $[100\,\mathrm{g/L}$ : $50~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ per  1 mL of sample) was immediately added to freshly squeezed IW to fix sulfide. Sulfide concentration s were measured using the methylene blue method (Hach reagents 181632 and 181732) accordin g to the proportions: $50~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ sample, $100\ \upmu\mathrm{L}\ 18\ \mathrm{M}\Omega$ water, and $50~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of each Hach reagent. Absorbance was measured at $670~\mathrm{nm}$ after waiting $5~\mathrm{min}$ for color development. Dilutions were mad e with $\Nu_{2}$ -purged $18.2\,\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water. For each dilution factor, a 5-point calibration curve (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and $0.8\;\mathrm{mM}$ ) was prepared with the same zinc acetate final concentrations. Precision on replicat e sulfide standards was better than $\pm0.02\;\mathrm{mM}$ $^{1\sigma,\,n=15}\!$ ).  

# 9.2.2.4. Major, minor, and trace elements  

Selected major and minor elements (Na, Ca, Mg, K, Li, B, P, Si, Ba, Fe, Mn, and Sr) were analyze d using the shipboard Agilent 5110 ICP-AES with an Agilent SPS4 autosampler. The general metho d for shipboard ICP-AES IW analysis is modified from ODP Technical Note 29 (Murray et al., 2000 ) with updates related to the specifications of the current Agilent ICP-AES instrument. Interna l standards were used to correct for instrument performance variations across the spectral range o f the elements of interest. A $500\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ aliquot of each IW sample was diluted to $5\,\mathrm{mL}$ with $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of a n internal standard solution containing 100 ppm Be, In, and Sc and $200\;\mathrm{ppm}\;\mathrm{Sb}$ , and $4.4~\mathrm{mL}$ of $2\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ . Each batch of samples analyzed on the ICP-AES included blanks and reference samples o f known concentrations. Each sample was analyzed three times in a sample run. Following eac h instrument run, the measured raw intensity values were automatically corrected for instrumen t drift and blank values, and calibration curves were calculated, using Agilent’s ICP Expert softwar e (Version 7.3.0.1.9507).  

Calibration curves for major cations (Na, K, Mg, and $C\mathbf{a}$ ) were established using a series of dilutions of IAPSO standard seawater (from 1:1 to $1{:}100\;\mathrm{IAPSO:}2\%\;\mathrm{HNO_{3}}$ . For minor and trace element analyses (K, Li, B, Si, Ba, Fe, Mn, and Sr), standards are made from a stock multielemen t solution prepared from ultrapure primary standards $\mathord{\left\{1000\mathrm{\ppm}\right.\kern-\nulldelimiterspace}9}\end{array}$ ; SPEX CertiPrep reference standards) in $2\%\ \mathrm{HNO_{3}}$ with 35 ppt NaCl. This stock solution was diluted using $2\%\mathrm{\HNO}_{3}+\mathrm{NaCl}$ t o produce a set of standards ranging from $1\%$ to $100\%$ of the stock solution elemental abundances. For consistency, calibration standards were diluted for ICP-AES measurement in the same way a s the samples, which were run at a 10:1 dilution factor. The 1:1 standard was repeatedly analyze d with each batch of samples over the expedition. The ICP-AES plasma was ignited at least $30\ \mathrm{min}$ before the sample run to allow the instrument to stabilize. For each run, the wavelengths wit h calibration curves showing the highest correlation coefficient ( $r$ value) for each element were use d to determine concentrations. Table T10 presents analytical precision and procedural detectio n limits for major and trace metals measured on IW using ICP-AES during Expeditions 390C, 395E, 390, and 393.  

# 9.2.2.5. Comparison of Ca, K, and Na data in IW samples measured by IC and ICP-AES  

As the shipboard ion chromatography (IC) and ICP-AES instruments both produce data for th e metals Ca, K, and Na, questions as to the relative quality of these data and which data set is th e “best” to use for each of these species are raised during nearly every IODP expedition. This question has become more pertinent with the installation of the new Agilent ICP-AES system, which i s capable of simultaneously measuring and calibrating multiple optical wavelengths for these an d other elements in both axial and radial modes, potentially improving analytical precision b y expanding the data collected for any given element in each sample (see Bulk elemental composition of rocks below for more about these capabilities). During Expedition 393, we did a comparative analysis of the performance of the IC and ICP for the alkaline elements following the standar d shipboard procedures for IW analysis, originally outlined in Murray et al. (2000), to help establis h clear criteria regarding which of the alkaline metal data sets should be used for final reporting o n shipboard analyses.

Although the IC and ICP-AES both produce precise $(1\%{-}2\%)$ data on unknown samples, measures of data accuracy on the two instruments differ. IC accuracy can be inferred from elemen t yields through the column. Na and K show $100\%\,\pm\,3\%$ yields using IC and are typically ${\tt>}99\%$ , whereas Ca is more variable $(93\%{-}104\%)$ . ICP-AES accuracy is a function of the choice of standards, the quality of fit from calibration curves generated using these standards (e.g., $r$ values $\geq$ $0.999X$ are preferred), and the spectral characteristics of the chosen optical wavelength(s) relate d to their linear dynamic ranges, which typically range from 10 times the elemental detection limit s up to values several orders of magnitude higher before optical saturation occurs and measure d intensities level off. For alkali metals, which all emit light in the red to infrared range (500–80 0 nm), detection limits are often very low, but the dynamic analytical ranges of these wavelength s are more limited. Optically, alkalis suffer from matrix enhancement effects, in which the ligh t matrix produced by all the elements in solution lead to nonlinear increases in signal on alkal i metal wavelengths. Thus, it is important when measuring alkali abundances on ICP-AES system s that the sample and standard compositions be similar to minimize matrix enhancement variations.  

Two different sets of standard solutions are used for IW runs: the first set is made by diluting th e IAPSO seawater standard with $2\%\ \mathrm{HNO_{3}}$ and running from $1\%$ to $200\%$ dilutions (i.e., twice th e normal amount of IAPSO is added, producing a 5:1 IAPSO standard solution for calibration o f unknowns that are uniformly diluted at 10:1); and the second is made from a synthetic seawate r solution with 35 ppt $\mathtt{N a C l}$ that is spiked with varying amounts of lower abundance elements (B, Li, Mn, Fe, P, S, Ba, Sr, and Si). The IAPSO standards suite is used to calibrate higher abundance species (Na, K, and Ca), and the in-house synthetic seawater standard suite is used for all lower abundance species. Na is only measured using the IAPSO standards, whereas K is measured using both.  

ICP-AES calibration curves generated for Na, K, and Ca on IW runs during Expedition 393 sho w evidence of nonlinearity for K and Na wavelengths, whereas the Ca calibration curves appear t o show no such issues. Figure F28A–F28C show working curves for the three available Na analytica l wavelengths. The 588.995 and $589.595~\mathrm{nm}$ lines, which are the most sensitive for Na, both sho w concave-down shapes indicative of detector saturation for the higher concentration standards. Although the Na correlation coefficient is better than that of the other two Na lines, the 330.29 8 nm Na line shows a slightly concave-up shape with a large negative intercept value, which point s to increased signal/concentration ratios at higher Na contents, a symptom of matrix enhancemen t effects related to the comparatively high $(>\!10\,\mathrm{mM})$ ) Na contents of these standards as prepared fo r IW analysis. In the case of K, Figure F28D shows that the two different sets of IW standards for m different curves for the $766.491\,\mathrm{nm}$ line, and both of these curves are concave downward, suggesting that signal saturation effects impact the higher abundance level standards. In nearly all cases, IW samples will have seawater-like Na and K contents, and some may have higher contents (se e Fryer et al. [2018] and Johnston et al. [2018] for discussions of IODP Expedition 366 IW sample s with 1.5–2 times seawater values for Na and K), which places these samples as unknowns along th e sections of the Na and K calibration curves where this nonlinearity is most pronounced and result s are the most likely to be affected.

Although the Na and K calibrations on the ICP-AES are impacted by signal saturation and matri x enhancement effects at the concentrations encountered in IW samples as prepared for ICP-AE S measurement, the instrument can nonetheless make highly reproducible measurements on thes e elements at these abundance levels, so there is often no clear evidence that these data are problematic beyond the shapes of their working curves and poor correlations with other data sources (e.g., shipboard IC results). Generating reliable Na and K data using ICP-AES, as noted above, require s attempting to generate uniform solution matrixes, which for these elements would involve a muc h more substantial dilution of the IW samples (from 10:1 to 100:1 or 500:1) to reduce the influenc e of variable sample matrixes. Given the need to measure many other, much lower abundance elements in these same samples, doing so would involve preparing a separate set of IW dilutions fo r Na and $\mathrm{K}\pm\mathrm{Ca}$ and running these elements on the ICP-AES separately. This approach may b e feasible during expeditions where IW sampling and analysis are not a large component of th e required work, but it may be problematic in terms of materials and technician and scientist tim e on many others. Given that the ion chromatography system measures both K and Na in water s with high precision and accuracy, it is clear that data for these elements should be preferred ove r ICP-AES results for IW samples under nearly all circumstances. Because Ca data from the ICPAES show no like concerns, choices whether to use IC or ICP Ca data can be made based on th e relative performance of the two instruments during an expedition and other related factors.

# 9.3. Oxygen measurements and Rhizon IW sampling  

# 9.3.1. Oxygen measurements  

During Expeditions 390 and 393, oxygen concentrations were measured in sediments from Hole s U1556C and U1556E, U1559C and U1559D, U1558F, U1560C, and U1583C to determine por e water dissolved oxygen profiles at each site. In cases where multiple sediment holes were drilled a t a given site during Expeditions 390 and 393, oxygen measurements were obtained from the firs t hole to guide IW and microbiology sampling in subsequent sediment holes.  

Oxygen concentrations were measured using Presens PM-PSt7 oxygen profiling microsensor s (PreSens, Regensburg, Germany; Fischer et al., 2009), and each sensor had a unique temperatur e probe assigned to it. The oxygen sensors were calibrated daily using air-saturated deionized wate r ( $100\%$ oxygen saturation) and $10~\mathrm{g/L}$ sodium sulfite $\left(\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{SO}_{3}\right)$ solutions $[0\%$ oxygen saturation). Oxygen measurements were determined using whole-core sections prior to splitting. A hole wa s drilled in the core liner using a power drill with a ${\sim}3\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter drill bit, and the oxygen microsensor was inserted manually into sediments $({\sim}2.5\,\mathrm{cm})$ through the hole. As many as 10 microsensors were used simultaneously for oxygen measurements through the multichannel oxygen mete r OXY-10ST, and the signal was allowed to equilibrate to a steady value $({\sim}20{-}30\ \mathrm{min})$ , on average, but sometimes as long as $90\mathrm{\min}]$ ). All calibration and measurement data were processed usin g PreSens Measurement Studio 2 software.  

At Site U1556, two core flows were used for oxygen measurements. During drilling in Hol e U1556C, whole cores were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature $(\sim\!4\!-\!6\mathrm{~h)}$ and were ru n through all whole-round loggers (see Physical properties and downhole measurements) befor e the oxygen measurements. Because the core sections were equilibrated to room temperature b y the time oxygen was measured, temperature probes were placed in a room temperature wate r bath. This core flow sometimes resulted in more than a $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ delay between core retrieval and oxygen measurements, which was deemed too long and resulted in scattered data downhole. For Hol e U1556E, a quicker core flow was implemented. The physical properties team agreed to run cor e sections through the NGRL and WRMSL (see Physical properties and downhole measurements) within $3\,\mathrm{{h}}$ of core retrieval and thus prior to core equilibration to room temperature. Th e core was then moved to the downhole laboratory for oxygen measurements. This resulted in a n average time from catwalk to oxygen measurement of ${\sim}6.75\,\mathrm{h}$ (range $=3.5–12.5\,\mathrm{h})$ ). There was les s sample-to-sample variation in the dissolved oxygen concentrations with this protocol. Because th e core was not yet equilibrated to room temperature, an additional hole was drilled in the core line r to insert the temperature probe. Oxygen and temperature probes were drilled ${\sim}20~\mathrm{cm}$ apart t o avoid disturbances caused by potential cracks in the core, as insertion of the probes into compacted sediments may induce cracking.  

For Hole U1559C, the core flow was further revised, and this core flow was subsequently used fo r all holes with oxygen measurements during Expedition 393. For this core flow, core sections wer e scanned on the STMSL by the physical properties team after arriving on the catwalk and the n immediately given to the geochemist/microbiologist measuring oxygen. Again, temperatur e probes were inserted through the liner ${\sim}20~\mathrm{cm}$ from the oxygen probe. This resulted in oxyge n measurements starting ${\sim}30$ min after arriving on the catwalk. Measurements were taken typicall y in Sections 1–6. We avoided the core catcher, which is disturbed, as well as the last section of  a core, as these were often short and/or disturbed as well.  

For Hole U1559D, the core flow used during Hole U1556C (oxygen measured $_{4-6\,\mathrm{h}}$ after the cor e arrival on deck) was used to test if the measurement lag would significantly alter the oxygen profile. Although the general pattern is the same, the Hole U1556C approach resulted in slightly noisier data than achieved for Hole U1559D at the same depths, indicating the time lag in oxyge n measurements does matter. This test was conducted using only two sections per core.  

Oxygen measurements were made at a frequency of ${\sim}3$ per core in Hole U1556C $\mathrm{^{1.5-5}}\,\mathrm{m}$ resolution), $^{\sim1}$ per section in Holes U1556E and U1559C, and 2 per core in Hole U1559D; intervals wit h drilling disturbance were avoided. Several $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ whole rounds were also taken from the catwalk fo r oxygen measurements from Hole U1556C (see Geochemistry in the Site U1556 chapter [Coggo n et al., 2024a]). Both the oxygen and temperature probes were inserted into these whole-roun d samples because they were not equilibrated to room temperature. This was done only during XC B drilling to determine if removing obvious drilling disturbance was better than inserting the prob e through the core liner, during which it is harder to see minor disturbance.  

During Expedition 393, the Presens PM-PSt7 oxygen profiling microsensors were spent after oxygen measurements were completed at Site U1583, and only three Presens PM-PSt7 oxygen profiling microsensors remained. This number was insufficient to complete measurements at Sit e U1560. A Presens Microx TX3 oxygen profiling system and accompanying probes were on th e ship for this. A test comparison was made between the two different oxygen measurement system s using sediment cores from Hole U1583E. Oxygen measurements in Hole U1583E were subsequently taken using the remaining Presens PM-PSt7 oxygen profiling microsensors along wit h Presens NTH-PSt1-L5-TF-NS40-0.8-OIW oxygen microsensors using the Presens Microx TX 3 oxygen transmitter system and TX3v602 software. The oxygen microsensors used with the Micro x TX3 system were calibrated in the same fashion as described above. This confirmed that bot h microsensor systems gave similar oxygen concentration readings. The oxygen concentration profile from Hole U1560C was subsequently measured using the Microx TX3 system.  

# 9.3.2. Rhizon IW sampling  

For the core flow used in Hole U1559C and during Expedition 393, cores were given back to th e physical properties team after oxygen measurements, equilibrated to room temperature, run o n the WRMSL, and then returned to the geochemist/microbiologist on duty for Rhizon sampling. This core flow was applied because Rhizon sampling affects the physical properties of the core, s o sampling needs to be done after WRMSL logging is complete.  

Upon completing the oxygen profile and WRMSL measurements, we extracted IW samples wit h Rhizon samplers prior to core splitting (Rhizosphere Research Products, Wageningen, The Netherlands), following the sampling protocol from Dickens et al. (2007). New holes were drilled a t least $20\,\mathrm{cm}$ away from the holes of oxygen measurements. Precleaned $(10\%\,\mathrm{HCl})$ ) $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ long Rhizo n samplers were inserted into holes and connected to precleaned ( $10\%$ HCl) $12~\mathrm{mL}$ syringes. Th e syringe plungers were pulled to generate a vacuum and held open with a wood spacer. Dependin g on the sediment porosity, as much as $11~\mathrm{mL}$ of IW was collected in ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{h}$ . In some samples, up t o $21~\mathrm{mL}$ of IW was collected, although high volumes derived from XCB cores may be the result o f drill fluid contamination. After collection, Rhizon IW samples were filtered through $0.2\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ polyethersulfone (PES) filters and stored in appropriate containers for postexpedition research.  

During Expedition 393, Rhizon-collected samples were run for major cations (Na, Mg, K, and Ca ) and anions (Cl, Br, and $\mathrm{{SO}_{4}}$ ) by IC. Concentration data agreement between Rhizon-collected an d squeezed IW was overall excellent in Holes U1558F and U1560C, with the exception of Ca, whic h had persistently lower concentrations in Rhizon samples compared to squeezed IW. In Hol e U1583C, the offset in measured concentrations between Rhizon and squeezed IW samples wa s larger than analytical uncertainties for Mg, K, Ca, Cl, and $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ .  

# 9.4. Sediment collection and bulk geochemistry  

# 9.4.1. Sediment collection  

Approximately $10~\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of bulk sediment was collected for geochemical analyses taken fro m squeeze cake residue, directly subsampled by the sedimentologists, or a combination of both. Samples were freeze-dried for a minimum of $12~\mathrm{{h}}$ and ground to a fine powder using an agat e pestle and mortar. Splits were taken from the ground sample for carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and XR D analysis. Remaining sample was stored in a glass vial and archived. XRD methodology is reporte d in Sedimentology.  

# 9.4.2. Inorganic and organic carbon  

TIC was measured by quantifying the carbon dioxide evolved from an acidification process on a n UIC Coulometrics $5017\,\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ coulometer. During Expedition 390, ${\sim}10~\mathrm{mg}$ of bulk powdered sediment was weighed using two electronic balances and a computer averaging system that correct s for ship motion (Cahn C-31 automated electrobalance). During Expedition 393, an average of 1 2 mg was weighed. The sediment was transferred to a clean sample vial, where it was reacted wit h $5.0\;\mathrm{mL}$ of 2 M HCl on a hot plate set at $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . This reaction converts any present carbonate to ${\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ . The sample gas was then transferred with an $\Nu_{2}$ carrier gas to a coulometer cell that was filled wit h a monoethanolamine solution and a colorimetric $\mathsf{p H}$ indicator. As the gas passed through the cell, ${\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ was quantitatively absorbed and reacted with the monoethanolamine to form a titratabl e acid. The increased acidity causes the color indicator to change, and the spectrophotomete r tracked the change in light transmittance.  

Weight percent calcium carbonate was calculated from the TIC content, assuming all $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ wa s derived from calcium carbonate: $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}\left(w t\%\right)=T I C\left(w t\%\right)\times10/12}$ . No correction was made fo r the presence of other carbonate minerals. A standard reference material $(>\!99.9\%)$ , $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3},$ Fishe r Scientific) was used to determine analytical precision ( $0.5\%$ and $0.6\%$ , TIC and ${\mathrm{CaCO}}_{3}$ , respectively). Weight percent TOC was calculated by subtracting TIC from TC (see next section).  

# 9.4.3. Total carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur content  

The concentrations of TC, total nitrogen (TN), and total sulfur (TS; with the exclusion of Expedition 393) in sediments and selected indurated (“cooked”) sediments in contact with basalts wer e determined by flash combustion on a ThermoScientific FlashSmart carbon-hydrogen-nitrogensulfur (CHNS) elemental analyzer. Approximately $15\,\mathrm{mg}$ of powdered sample was weighed into ti n capsules on the Cahn C-31 electrobalance system. To ensure complete combustion of sulfur, a n equivalent mass of $\mathrm{V}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{5}$ catalyst was mixed with the sample before sealing the tin capsule durin g  

Expedition 390. Samples were combusted in the elemental analyzer at $1020^{\circ}C$ in a stream o f helium, nitrogen oxides were reduced to $\ensuremath{\mathrm{N}}_{2}$ in the presence of reduced copper $(650^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ , and th e ${\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ , $\mathsf{N}_{2},$ and ${\mathrm{SO}}_{2}$ produced from the sample were separated on a GC column (packed PTFE, $2\,\mathrm{m}$ , $6\ \mathrm{mm}\,\times\,5\ \mathrm{mm}_{\mathrm{}}$ , CE Elantech, 260082-15). Sample gas intensities were detected by a therma l conductivity detector (TCD) and normalized to a CNS calibration standard (2.5-bis[5-tert-butylbenzoxazol-2-yl]thiophene [BBOT]; $\mathrm{\DeltaC\,=\,72.53\wt\%}$ , $\mathrm{{N}=6.517~w t\%}$ , and $\mathrm{S}\,=\,7.44\mathrm{~wt}\%$ ). Buffal o River Sediment (NIST 2704; $C\,=\,3.35~\mathrm{wt}\%$ , $\mathrm{N}\,=\,0.18~\mathrm{wt}\%$ , and $\mathrm{S}\,=\,0.40~\mathrm{wt}\%$ ) was run every 1 0 samples to monitor for analytical drift and determine analytical precision ( $0.9\%$ and $8.6\%$ relativ e standard deviation [RSD] for C and N, respectively).  

The extent to which the TN contains inorganic nitrogen such as ammonium within the clay matri x was assessed by regression of TN vs. TOC, where a positive relationship with a near-zero $y.$ - intercept indicates the nitrogen is predominantly from organic matter (Schubert and Calvert, 2001).  

Table T9 lists precision and detection limits for the sediment geochemistry analyses during th e SAT expeditions.  

# 9.5. Bulk elemental compositions of rocks  

# 9.5.1. Sample preparation  

Representative samples of basement rocks were taken from the working halves of cores recovere d during Expeditions 390 and 393 for major and minor/trace element analyses by ICP-AES supplemented with additional samples from cores recovered during Expeditions 390C and 395E, wher e available (i.e., only cores from the sediment/basement interface because only the archive halves o f shallower sediment cores were onboard).  

Within the basement sections of the SAT sites, representative samples were taken from the macroscopically freshest portions of each igneous unit to obtain a downhole record of the primary magmatic conditions, following the approaches described for Expeditions 301, 336, 352, and 38 5 (Expedition 301 Scientists, 2005; Expedition 336 Scientists, 2012; Reagan et al., 2015; Teske et al., 2021). More intensely altered rocks were generally avoided, with the exception of a few paire d samples that displayed different styles or extents of alteration within different portions of the sam e lava or a single basaltic clast in a breccia to investigate alteration effects on the bulk rock compositions. These paired samples are referred to as alteration pairs. During Expeditions 390 and 393, geochemistry samples and a thin section billet were both taken from the same core piece, acros s the width of the piece, where possible.  

All outer surfaces of selected rock samples were ground with a diamond wheel to remove surfac e contamination by saw marks and any altered rinds from drilling. Each rock sample was then ultrasonicated in trace-metal-grade $70\%$ isopropyl alcohol for $15\,\mathrm{min}$ . The samples were then sonicate d in deionized water for $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ and in $18.2\;\mathrm{M}\Omega{\cdot}\mathrm{cm}$ deionized water for another $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ . The cleane d pieces were dried for $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $110^{\circ}C$ . The cleaned, dried rock samples were crushed to $^{<1}$ cm chip s between two disks of Delrin plastic in a hydraulic press. The chips were powdered using a SPE X Shatterbox with a tungsten carbide grinding canister. As documented by the Expedition 304/30 5 Scientists (2006), contamination from the tungsten carbide mill is negligible for most of the elements analyzed during shipboard chemical analyses, although Co contamination during the powdering process is possible (Godard et al., 2009).  

This sample powder was used to determine LOI and make glass beads for ICP-AES analysis $_{(5\mathrm{~g)}}$ . Sample powders were also used to make powder mounts for pXRF measurements and semiquantitative mineralogy by XRD. All remaining materials were saved for postexpedition research.  

# 9.5.2. Loss on ignition  

A sample of $5.00\,\pm\,0.05\mathrm{~g~}$ of each powder was weighed into a quartz crucible using a Mettle r Toledo balance and then ignited to determine the weight LOI. During Expedition 390, sample s were heated for $4~\mathrm{h}$ at $1025^{\circ}C.$ . During Expedition 393, failure of heating elements in the muffl e furnace led to a modified procedure aimed at extending furnace life, in which samples were heate d at $950^{\circ}C$ for $30{-}45\ \mathrm{min}$ . This change in procedure led to no differences in sample measurement s by ICP-AES (e.g., major element totals approximated $100\%$ ), indicating our samples were full y devolatilized despite the lower temperature and shorter duration. Estimated precision is $\pm0.02\mathrm{\g}$ $(\pm0.4\%)$ .  

# 9.5.3. Bulk major and trace element concentrations (ICP-AES) for hard rock  

Ignited sample powder $\left(100\pm0.5\;\mathrm{mg}\right)$ was weighed and mixed with $400.0\pm0.5~\mathrm{mg}$ of $\mathrm{LiBO}_{2}$ flux. An aqueous LiBr solution ( $10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of $0.172~\mathrm{mM})$ ) was added to the flux and powder mixture as  a nonwetting agent to prevent the fused bead from sticking to the crucible during cooling. Standar d reference samples (Expedition 390: USGS BHVO-2, GSJ JB-1b, NIST-2702, BCR-2, BIR-1, and JB2; Expedition 393 basalts: BHVO-2, BCR-2, DNC-1, BIR-1, W-2, JB-3, JB-2a, JGB-1, NBS 688, an d BAS 140 [in-house standard from Hole 504B]; Expedition 393 sediments: SCO-1, SDC-1, SDO-1, AGV-1, JA-1, and NIST-1C) and full procedural blanks were prepared as stock solutions an d included with unknowns in each ICP-AES run. Standard stock solutions prepared at the final dilution factor for ICP analysis (5000:1) can last several weeks without deterioration. During Expedition  393,  new  standard  digestions  were  prepared  and  new  stock  solutions  were  mad e approximately every 3 weeks. Reference materials were measured as check standards during eac h run, and during Expedition 393 reference Sample JB-1b and later W-2 were run as monitors fo r instrument drift.  

Samples were fused in Pt-Au (95:5) crucibles for ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{min}$ at $1250^{\circ}C$ in an internally rotating induction furnace (Bead Sampler NT-2100). After cooling, beads were transferred to $125~\mathrm{mL}$ HDP E bottles and dissolved in $50\mathrm{\mL\10\%\HNO_{3}},$ aided by shaking with a Burrell wrist-action bottl e shaker for $^{1\,\mathrm{h}}$ . An aliquot of $0.5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of each solution was diluted with $4.4\,\mathrm{mL}$ of $10\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ trace meta l grade $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and $0.1\;\mathrm{mL}$ of an internal standard solution containing Be, In $(100\;\upmu\mathrm{g}/\upmathrm{g})$ , and Sb (20 0 $\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{g})$ . The final dilution factor for the samples is ${\sim}5000{:}1$ . Major (Si, Ti, Al, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, Na, K, and P) and trace (Ba, Sr, Zr, Y, V, Sc, Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni, and Y) element concentrations were determined using the shipboard Agilent 5110 ICP-AES. During a given run, each analysis involves thre e ICP measurements, and samples are each measured at least twice, whereas check standards an d drift and blank samples are measured 4–5 times throughout the course of the runs. The optica l wavelengths that produced the best calibration curves, as defined by their $r$ values, were used t o calculate solution concentrations. In the case of all the major elements except K, multiple wavelengths per element had $r$ values of $0.999X$ and were $10\times$ above instrument detection limits in thei r linear dynamic ranges. Results from all such wavelengths, in many cases both axially and radiall y measured by the instrument, were used to calculate solution concentrations.  

Analytical reproducibility on the ICP-AES for rock analysis is a function of both the measuremen t precision of the chosen wavelengths $1\%{-2\%}$ uncertainties are typical) and the number of wavelengths calibrated for each element, as each measured wavelength is an independent abundanc e determination. Table T11 lists the detection limits and measurement precision for each analyze d element, based on duplicate measurements of sample unknowns. For the higher abundance majo r elements (Si, Al, Fe, Mg, and Ca), all of which are measured axially and/or radially on multipl e wavelengths, precision lies between $\pm0.6\%$ and $\pm1.1\%$ , whereas the lower abundance major specie s (Na, K, Ti, and Mn) range $0.7\%{-}1.9\%$ . Major element totals, which can be treated as a secondar y net measurement of overall instrument precision, were $98\%{-}101.5\%$ .  

# 9.5.4. Rock and sample powder analysis using pXRF spectrometer  

Expeditions 390 and 393 made extensive use of the shipboard handheld pXRF spectrometers t o expand geochemical capabilities and to provide near-real-time data on compositional changes i n recovered hard rock cores. During Expedition 390, the shipboard pXRF was the Olympus Delt a Premium 6000 portable XRF analyzer, whereas during Expedition 393, a new Bruker Tracer 5 g handheld XRF was available. These instruments are self-contained energy-dispersive XRF surve y tools that include data correction packages tailored to a variety of applications (metals, plastics, soils and minerals, consumer goods). Instrumental data correction methods combine Compto n normalization strategies (specific to lower $Z$ elements) and “fundamental parameters” (FP) methodologies, which solve a series of nonlinear equations for each analyzed element. The parameter s used in the FP equations comprise metrics for the X-ray source, fluorescence intensities, absorption coefficients, and absorption edge effects for each wavelength analyzed, together with parameters for sample geometry (e.g., van Sprang, 2000).  

Both the Olympus and Bruker pXRF instruments include geologic materials correction protocols: the “Geochem” analysis protocol on the Olympus instrument, and the “GeoExploration” protoco l on the Bruker instrument. These protocols, which include both FP and Compton normalizatio n correction, optimize analysis for many higher atomic number species, as well as a number of ke y lower $Z$ elements. As a practical matter, many of the elements determined using pXRF on rocks, sediments, and related geologic materials (Cd, Sb, As, Hg, W, Mo, Bi, Ag, Sn, Se, Pb, Th, and U ) largely occur at levels below the in-rock detection limits for these instruments, and a few (in particular Sc and Ba) suffer from spectral interference problems that preclude reliable analysis at th e levels likely to be encountered in common igneous rocks or marine sediments. Elements with lo w atomic numbers (Na, Mg, Si, and Al) are poor at generating X-rays and produce only low-energy, readily absorbed X-rays. Consequently, even though these species are high in abundance in rocks, their X-ray yields are poor and nonlinear as related to concentration. As such, pXRF is analyticall y useful for a subset of elements whose abundances are high enough for detection and that produc e X-rays sufficiently energetic for quantifiable analysis. This list of elements varies somewhat wit h rock type but commonly includes K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, Cu, Rb, Sr, Y, and Zr. S and P ar e also quantitatively accessible at higher concentrations, as may be encountered in sulfate-, sulfide-, or phosphate-rich lithologies.

Prior expeditions, including Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 330, 335, and 345 an d IODP Expeditions 352, 366, and 376, used the pXRF and evaluated its efficacy (e.g., Expeditio n 330 Scientists, 2012; Expedition 335 Scientists, 2012b; Gillis et al., 2014; Reagan et al., 2015; Frye r et al., 2018; Ryan et al., 2017; Johnston et al., 2018; de Ronde et al., 2019). Earlier expeditions foun d the available pXRF instrument (an earlier generation Fisher Niton GOLDDxlt pXRF) to be of limited use (Expedition 330 Scientists, 2012; Expedition 335 Scientists. 2012b; Gillis et al., 2014). However, during Expedition 352 the Fisher Niton pXRF was used extensively in characterizatio n of recovered forearc basalts and boninites from the Izu-Bonin forearc and was deemed critical t o resolving flow and unit boundaries in the cores as well as in recognizing features indicative o f open-system processes (mixing and magma mingling fabrics; Reagan et al., 2015, 2017; Ryan et al., 2017; Shervais et al., 2019, 2021). During Expedition 352, pXRF output was calibrated externall y for the elements listed above using working curves developed through analysis of pertinent geologic reference materials, and tests were conducted documenting that instrument results on roc k powders and sample surfaces were analytically indistinguishable (Ryan et al. 2017).  

The Olympus pXRF instrument was used successfully during a number of expeditions, includin g Expeditions 366 (see Johnston et al., 2018) and 376. During Expedition 390, scientists attempted t o use the Olympus pXRF to examine samples that had been powdered for XRD and ICP-AES analysis as well as for sample surface measurements. Unfortunately, only the most sensitive element s (K, Sr, Ti, and $Z\mathbf{r}$ ) gave reliable results. The issues related largely to the quality of the data produce d by the instrument, which may have been an issue of age (the Olympus instrument was put int o service in 2016), but may have also related to the inherent challenges of analyzing solid rock material that is heterogeneous and/or highly altered. However, Expedition 390 was able to documen t good correlations for shipboard samples analyzed by both ICP-AES and pXRF that supporte d their use of these elements in surveys of the solid core materials. For Expedition 393, the Olympu s instrument was replaced with the new Bruker Tracer $5\mathrm{g\,pXRF},$ which included both updated X-ra y generation and detector hardware and updated data correction protocols. The cores recovere d during Expedition 390 were subsequently characterized using a Bruker Tracer 5g instrument i n College Station, Texas (USA), during the Expedition 390/393 hard rock sampling party.  

# 9.5.4.1. pXRF analytical protocols  

For shipboard XRF analysis, samples were either loaded into the sample holder systems provide d with the Bruker or Olympus instruments or placed in the specially made shielded sample analysi s assembly available on the ship. In all cases, it was important that the geometry of the sample wa s consistent, with its surface parallel to and in very close proximity to the face of the analyzer. Thi s is required to minimize atmospheric absorption effects and geometry-related intensity losses. Th e protocols for instrument analyses were outlined in instructions for instrument provided by th e JOIDES Resolution Science Operator (JRSO). For the Olympus instrument, the Geochem analysi s mode was used with counting times of $30~\mathrm{s}$ for both Beam 1 and Beam 2. For the Bruker instrument the GeoExploration application was used, with the Oxide 3 Phase Method. For analysis o f archive-half core samples, sample names were either entered automatically using the barcod e scanner on the D-tube cap labels (expedition number, site, hole, core, and section), or it was type d manually into the instrument application on the PC. The locations of analyses within a core section (in centimeters) was input manually. Depending on the homogeneity of the sample material, purpose of the analysis, and time available, one or more measurements were made for each sample. Where multiple measurements were taken, these were averaged to provide a single sampl e analysis. One powdered standard reference material (BHVO-2) was analyzed with each set o f unknowns to track daily instrument performance, consistent with past practice (e.g., Ryan et al. 2017) (Tables T12, T13).  

Examples of the daily variations for Zr, Ti, Sr, and K for the Olympus pXRF are shown in Figur e F29. The diagrams show that the $\mathtt{p X R F}$ results are relatively reproducible but tend to be highl y inaccurate (i.e., they do not reproduce the preferred values for the standard). As an example,  K yields average values that are less than one-third of the accepted value for the standard, BHVO- 2 (Figure F29). Similar differences were seen with the Bruker instrument, but these were muc h smaller: as examples, $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ reported from the instrument was generally within $10\%$ of accepte d values, whereas $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ and Sr contents were often identical within error. Day-to-day variations fo r calibrated elements using the Bruker instrument were commonly within the uncertainties of thei r analyses. Although the Bruker instrument reports $\mathrm{SiO}_{2},$ $\mathrm{MgO}$ , and $\mathrm{{Al}}_{2}\mathrm{{O}}_{3}$ values, these data ar e unreliable absent a controlled atmosphere: generally they are low relative to accepted values an d can vary considerably from day to day. External calibration curves were necessary to generat e accurate data with both of these instruments, as had been noted previously (e.g., Johnston et al. 2018).

# 9.5.4.2. Rock surface analyses  

During the SAT expeditions, the primary use of the $\mathtt{p X R F}$ was to conduct geochemical assessments of volcanic rocks in the core through direct measurements on cut rock surfaces.  

pXRF measurements were predominantly made on the archive halves of the cores. The sampl e holder systems were used to position smaller samples, and during Expedition 390 a speciall y made, shielded XRF holder and mounting system was used for longer core segments and large r rock samples. Both sample holder systems provided optimal geometry for quantitative use of th e system in ideal conditions. Analyses of larger core segments may suffer from greater uncertaintie s because of difficulties in precisely positioning the pXRF in the inverted position over the area o f interest and/or the potential for the gun to shift or wobble during analysis because of ship movement because it is not tightly secured when used in this position.

# 9.5.4.3. Analyses of sample powders  

The pXRF systems were also used to assess elemental abundances in rock powders produced fo r ICP-AES analysis from samples taken from the working half of the core. Samples were prepare d for pXRF analysis using plastic powder mount assemblies. A short length of thin transparent fil m for XRF applications (Ultralene or an equivalent product) was stretched across one end of th e mount base and held in place using a plastic ring-cap, producing a smooth, transparent surface fo r sample loading. Sample powder was loaded inside the mount base on the transparent film to  a depth of $2{-}10\;\mathrm{mm}$ . A small circle of filter paper (Whatman $24\;\mathrm{mm}$ circles, grade 540) was place d on top of the sample, and a round $24\;\mathrm{mm}$ plastic foam spacer (similar to those used to fill gaps i n sediment core left by sampling) was packed behind the filter paper to hold the sample powder i n place, followed by a snap-on plastic sealing cap. The transparent surface of the mount was place d face-up in the XRF sample holder to permit analysis of the powder.  

To generate accurate abundances using the pXRF during Expedition 390, measurements wer e conducted on ICP-AES sample powders from Sites U1556, U1557, U1559, and U1561. ICP-AE S and pXRF data for the same sample powders were plotted and data distributions evaluated usin g the regression functions available in Microsoft Excel. Correlations for Ti, Zr, K, and Sr are show n in Figure F30. The Olympus data initially produced linear regressions for all four elements, an d this approach works well for Zr, K, and Sr, with all three elements yielding correlation coefficient s $(R^{2})$ of 0.99 or greater (Figure F30B–F30D). The linear function for fitting the Ti data yielded a lo w correlation coefficient $\left(R^{2}\,=\,0.75\right)$ (Figure F30A). A second-order polynomial produces a muc h better fit for the Ti data $\!\!\!{\sqrt{R^{2}}}=0.94\!\!\right)$ . The [y] intercept values for all four elements indicate significant offset from the origin (Figure F30), particularly for K and Zr, which reflects the inaccuracy o f the raw Olympus pXRF data discussed above (Figure F29).

Red lines $=$ averages and standard deviations, blue lines $=$ preferred standard values. Note significant offset in measured and accepted values, particularly for K.  

Measurements of the solid core surface of the archive half that corresponded to the sample locations taken for ICP-AES analysis show reasonable agreement. Figure F31 shows this compariso n graphically in a plot of $[\mathrm{Ti}/Z\mathrm{r}]_{\mathrm{N}}$ values for data determined by ICP-AES versus $[\mathrm{Ti}/Z\mathrm{r}]_{\mathrm{N}}$ calculate d from the corrected concentrations determined by pXRF for the solid core samples. Even thoug h there is the potential for uncertainty in this analysis, as the powders and rock surface materials ar e not identical the data show a remarkably good correlation, with most plotting close to the 1:1 correlation line (Figure F31). The correction is best for samples with $[Z\mathrm{r/Ti}]_{\mathrm{N}}$ ratios $^{<1}$ or ${>}1.6$ . Th e discrepancy is greatest for rocks with $[Z\mathrm{{r/Ti}]_{N}}$ of 1.3–1.6. In this interval, the ratios determined b y pXRF are $5\%{-}10\%$ too low because the shape of the second-order polynomial used to fit the Olympus pXRF Ti data passes directly through the data above $1.75\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ and below $1\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ but is offset i n the middle region due to scatter (see Figure F30A).  

# 9.5.4.4. Analyses using the Bruker Tracer 5g pXRF system  

Using the Bruker pXRF during Expedition 393, we followed the pXRF calibration protocols outlined in Ryan et al. (2017) and Johnston et al. (2018). The standards chosen for establishing ou r working curves were drawn from those listed in Johnston et al. (2018), adjusted by element to b e more appropriate to the basaltic compositions of our sample unknowns. Depending on the element, between 10 and 15 reference materials were used to establish calibration curves. Figure F32 includes working curve plots, slopes, and intercepts for all of the elements analyzed.

Single outlier data point is from 390-U1556B-39R-1 (Piece 8, $99{-}101~\mathsf{c m}$ ). Dotted line $=1{:}7$ correlation.  

Generally speaking, those elements deemed to be reliable for analysis by pXRF have clearly linea r working curves $r=0.95$ or better) and near-zero intercept values, though in detail there are exceptions to these criteria. MnO yields reliable data despite an $r=0.89$ , which relates more to the limited variability in Mn and data quality for Mn in reference samples than to any issues wit h instrument performance. The Cr working curve has a high $r$ value but also a large intercept, yet C r measurements are reproducible over time. V is an important element for tectonic discrimination, so it is useful chemostratigraphically even if its correlation parameters are marginal. To bette r maintain instrument accuracy, working curves were rerun every several weeks and two Hol e U1559B samples (5R-1, 106–112 cm, and 11R-1, $6{-}13~\mathrm{cm}$ ) and BHVO-2 were run as check standards with each set of unknowns (see below). Table T14 documents the performance of th e Bruker instrument through time. Similar to what was observed by Ryan et al. (2017) and Johnsto n et al. (2018), the Bruker pXRF working curves are robust, requiring only limited updating ove r periods of a month.

More elements were accessible using the Bruker pXRF relative to the Olympus, a number of whic h are potentially useful in examining the sourcing of recovered basalts (Ti, Zr, Y, V, Zn, and Cu) an d the extent of hydrothermal alteration (K, Ca, Sr, and Rb). The calibration spreadsheet for use wit h pXRF data is designed such that one can input CSV text files generated by the instrument softwar e directly into the sheet, which then calculates corrected concentrations (see PXRF in Supplementary material for an example calibration workbook). Powdered rock samples run for full quantitative analysis by pXRF were measured three times each. Chemostratigraphic surveys of core roc k surfaces in the archive halves of cores may only measure any given spot once but also includ e transects across key boundaries (basalt/sediment interfaces at the seafloor and also within cores).  

# 9.5.4.5. Assessment of pXRF rock surface precision and accuracy  

To assess the precision, accuracy, and reproducibility of the Bruker instrument as applied to spli t core surfaces (rock surfaces), two cut surfaces of basalt samples recovered from Hole U1559B wer e measured repeatedly over the course of Expedition 393 (Samples 393-U1559B-5R-1, $106{-}112\,\mathrm{cm}$ , and 11R-1, $6{-}13\;\mathrm{cm}$ , referred to herein as rock standards). Rock standard 5R-1, $106{-}112\;\mathrm{cm}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , is a n aphyric crypto- to microcrystalline basalt from Volcanic Subunit 2B of Hole U1559B (Figur e F33B). Rock standard 11R-1, $6{-}13~\mathrm{cm}$ , is an aphyric microcrystalline basalt from Subunit 3B o f Hole U1559B (Figure F33B). These standards were selected for their fresh, homogeneous, an d aphyric texture at the scale of the ${\sim}1\;\mathrm{cm}\times1$ cm surface analyzed by pXRF. The back of the sampl e was cut and powdered for comparative whole-rock analysis by both ICP-AES and pXRF (as  a powder mount).  

![](images/7128bbc56f469aa7a0e597e84f79e1b583e7794fbbfb5300d3f02cd43e86ec86.jpg)  
Figure F32 (continued). I. Rb. J. Y. K. Sr. L. Zr. M. Cr. N. V.  

The two rock standards were measured repeatedly alongside the split core surfaces over the cours e of Expedition 393 $\left(n=40\right)$ . The results are summarized in Table T14, and key elements are plotte d in Figures F34 and F35. Whole-rock powders cut from the same piece, and these powders wer e analyzed by pXRF (Figure F33C) and by ICP-AES, and are presented alongside the rock surfac e results for comparison (Figures F34, F35).  

Considering the precision based on 40 repeat analyses, major element oxide relative standar d deviations (RSDs) are as follows: $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ , $\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}},$ and $\mathrm{CaO\RSD}=0.9\%{-}5.7\%$ ; $\mathrm{K_{2}O}$ and MnO ${\mathrm{RSD}}=$ $6.2\%{-9.3\%}$ . Trace element precision is as follows: Ni, Zn, Sr, Y, and $\mathrm{Zr\RSD<10\%}$ , and Cr, V, Cu, and R $\mathrm{~b~RSD~}<20\%$ .  

In terms of accuracy, the 1σ range of our mean calibrated pXRF rock surface measurements overlaps with the concentrations determined by ICP-AES for V, Y, and $Z\mathbf{r}.$ . For $\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3},\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O},$ and Sr, onl y one of the two standards has a 1σ range in rock surface pXRF results that overlaps with the ICP

# AES result. For CaO, $\mathrm{TiO}_{2},$ and $C\mathbf{r},$ the rock surface pXRF 1σ range is lower than the ICP-AE S result.  

Precisions of ${<}15\%$ RSD for all the key major and trace elements utilized for shipboard study o f magmatic and hydrothermal processes are encouraging and may reflect the natural limits of heterogeneity for the rock standard surfaces. The discrepancies in mean pXRF rock surface value s between the rock surface and ICP-AES results suggest that some elements may benefit from recalibration or normalization to the standards measured throughout the expedition, if the ICP-AE S results for the rock standard powders are shown to be accurate by repeat onshore analyses.

# 10. Microbiology  

# 10.1. Sample selection  

For microbiological studies of both sediment and hard rocks, whole-round core samples ar e required to allow removal of the core exterior, which may have been contaminated during drillin g and subsequent sample handling. Microbiology whole-round core samples are selected before th e core splitting process because this process introduces substantial contamination. All scientists an d technicians involved in sampling wore gloves sprayed with ethanol and face masks to limit possible contamination of the samples from human contact. Whole-round core samples recovere d from sediment using APC and XCB coring were selected and cut with sterile spatulas on the catwalk before being taken to the microbiology laboratory. Whole-round samples from hard roc k cores collected using RCB coring were sampled in the splitting room immediately after the cor e was brought in from the catwalk. Technicians shook the hard rock core into a clean split core line r that had been sprayed with ethanol. A microbiologist then selected a whole-round section fo r sampling in consultation with a Co-Chief Scientist and a member of the petrology team. An idea l sample had some indication of permeability (such as visible veins) but had not split apart durin g the coring process. The whole-round rock sample chosen for dedicated microbiology investigatio n was photographed from overhead in context with the remainder of the core and then transferre d into a sterile bag, sealed, and brought to the microbiology laboratory for processing.  

# 10.2. Sampling protocols for sediment and hard rock  

For SAT Expeditions 390 and 393, all hard rock samples were initially processed on the laborator y bench between two KOACH units (Figure F36A). Each KOACH unit contains a fan to push ai r through HEPA filters so that when two units are placed facing each other, the air in the spac e between is clean and has positive pressure, preventing contamination from particles in the air. I n addition to the clean air environment, a deionization bar placed behind the KOACH units (closes t to wall) and a Ptec air ionizer placed atop one of the KOACH units were used to prevent particle s from sticking to samples. Masks, gloves, and laboratory coats were worn by those handling th e sample during whole-round cleaning and all subsequent steps. At all stages of this process, samples were handled as little as possible and with gloved hands only.  

Hard rock samples were handled in an ethanol-washed stainless steel rock box. Whole-roun d samples of hard rock material were rinsed four times in sterile autoclaved $3.5\%$ NaCl water in  a sterile sample bag (changing the bag once after the second rinse) to reduce contamination fro m drilling fluids and then transferred to the rock box, where the outside of the core was sprayed wit h $70\%$ ethanol. The whole round was then placed on the Foldio light box imaging turntable (Figur e F36B), photographed once with a color-correction card and the curatorial identifiers of the roc k including directionality, if known, and then imaged using the Foldio device (see below). Afte r imaging, the whole-round sample was sprayed with $70\%$ ethanol once more and placed in the presterilized rock box. The outside of the whole round, which had been in contact with drilling fluids, seawater, and air, was labeled with a wax pencil and removed. The rock was broken using either  a sterile hammer and chisel or the SPEX X-Press rock crusher if the pieces were too hard to brea k manually. To maintain the sample in a clean environment, the inside of the X-Press machine wa s sprayed with $70\%$ ethanol before each use, and the sample was placed into two sterile sample bags. The interior pristine rock pieces were further broken down into smaller pieces using a sterile hammer and chisel to fulfill the microbiologists’ postexpedition research requirements, as describe d below.  

Whole-round samples from sediments were processed differently depending on the subsamplin g required. Samples to be used for analyses measuring microbial activity and/or anaerobic microbia l processes (sulfate reduction assays, stable isotope incubations, anaerobic culturing, or viral production) were placed in the anaerobic chamber in the walk-in cold room until processing coul d occur. Whole-round samples selected for postexpedition cell counts, nucleic acid analysis, ammonium enrichment incubations, or lipid analysis were placed in the cold room or a $4^{\circ}C$ refrigerato r until processing in aerobic conditions between the two KOACH units to mitigate contamination. This dual setup (processing samples in both the anaerobic chamber and KOACH unit) allowe d more rapid sample processing of sediment sections. Note that during initial sediment sampling i n

Hole U1556B, all sediment was handled in the anaerobic chamber for the first several cores. It wa s subsequently decided that the pace of subsampling and sample processing was too slow, resultin g in the microbiology team being several cores behind, so the sample work flow described above wa s implemented.  

# 10.2.1. Digital imaging of microbiological hard rock samples  

A Foldio light box and Foldio turntable connected to the Foldio360 application on an iPhone 1 2 was used to image all microbiological hard rock samples prior to processing (Figure F36B). Onl y the turntable was placed inside the KOACH bench to allow ease of use and to prevent the air fro m the KOACH bench being blocked by the walls of the light box. However, the light box was folde d down (as it is designed to do) and placed behind the turntable to provide a white background fo r contrast when photographing. Cleaned microbiological samples were placed on a piece of aluminum foil on the turntable after the foil was wiped down with $70\%$ ethanol. The Foldio360 application pairs via Bluetooth to the turntable and can be programmed to generate a series of photo s capturing all sides of the sample. We used 36 photos, but this number is adjustable. Medium turning speed and brightest lights (both adjustable in the Foldio360 app) were used. Velcro was place d on the bottom of the standing column lights, and the bottom of the Velcro was taped to the laboratory bench for consistent placement of the lights. Additionally, the turntable light, also at brightest setting, was turned “backward,” facing the rear of the setup toward the backdrop so that i t provided reflected backlight off the white surface of the backdrop. During Expedition 390, sample s were imaged oriented vertically with the top-side up and then imaged vertically top-side down. Samples were imaged occasionally in a horizontal orientation if the whole round could not b e propped to remain upright while photographing. During Expedition 393, samples were alway s imaged in a horizontal orientation. The generated image folders were named with the sampl e identifiers, the direction the sample was facing, and the timestamp, which was automatically use d by Foldio360 as the name initially (e.g., U1557D_5R5_down-20220513114258). A log sheet wa s kept for these images. Logging the time is important for keeping track of folders. When renamin g files later with the sample name, the timestamp helped the scientist match the log to the files. Th e images generated were stitched into a movie of the whole round rotating by the Foldio360 application. This documentation/imaging is valuable for understanding the physical context of the microbiology samples (how many veins, how large, etc.), integration with the petrologic visual cor e descriptions, and postexpedition core-log integration.  

# 10.3. Contamination testing of drilling fluids  

As part of the drilling process, a large amount of surface seawater is injected into the borehole. This fluid is the main potential source of microbial contamination during coring. To check fo r fluid intrusion and contamination, the microbial composition of drilling fluid will be assesse d postexpedition using DNA sequencing approaches. Organisms found to be present in both th e drilling fluid and rock samples will be considered contaminants (Sheik et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020).  

Drilling fluid samples were collected during drilling at each site during Expeditions 390 and 39 3 (Figure F37). Sterile gloves were worn throughout these procedures. Samples were accesse d directly from the injection pipe on the rig floor and collected in sterile bottles with screw caps. I n each instance, drilling fluid was collected and then two samples were taken for cell counts (treate d as indicated below), one sample was taken for perfluoromethyldecalin (PFMD) analysis (Expedition 393 only), and the rest was filtered onto one or two $47\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter, $0.20\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ pore-size Millipore Express Plus polycarbonate filters and frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for shored-based DNA extraction an d analysis. Additionally, samples of the sepiolite drilling mud used during RCB coring were collecte d for microbiological contamination monitoring prior to injection of the mud into the drill pip e using two $50~\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tubes; these samples were frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for shore-based DN A extraction. During Expedition 393 only, samples of sepiolite were also preserved for cell counts.  

We used the contamination tracer PFMD for the SAT expeditions (Li et al., 2020; Sylvan et al., 2021) (Figure F37), following the methodology used during Expedition 360 (MacLeod et al., 2017). PFMD was continuously pumped with the drilling fluid at an average rate of ${\sim}0.5~\mathrm{mL/min};$ ; th e pump rate was set to vary with drill fluid pump rate. The tracer was used during RCB coring i n Hole U1556B and APC/XCB coring in Holes U1559C and U1556D during Expedition 390 and i n  

Holes U1559B, U1558D, and U1583F (through Core 393-U1583F-12R) during Expedition 393. Prohibitive costs of PFMD prevented purchase of enough tracer to run in every hole; therefore, pumping during basement drilling in the full range of lithologies encountered was prioritized.  

For sediment samples, a $2~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ scraping from the exterior of the whole-round sample was transferred to a $20\;\mathrm{mL}$ headspace glass vial and sealed for later analysis of PFMD. A $2\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample fro m the interior of the whole round was taken using an autoclaved $3\,\mathrm{mL}$ syringe with the tip cut off an d likewise transferred to a $20\;\mathrm{mL}$ headspace vial. For hard rock samples, a fragment of the exterior o f each core was selected from pebbles in the core liner in the splitting room instead of samplin g directly from the microbiology whole round. This method ensured that we could detect delivery o f the PFMD to the exterior of the sample. During sampling of Hole U1559B and if no pebbles wer e available in the core liner, rock chips from the whole-round exterior were used instead. It shoul d be noted that sampling the outer part of the core typically happens after rinsing and cleaning of th e core, which can cause the sample to be diluted with interior unexposed material, which woul d result in PFMD tracer concentrations too low to provide conclusive results. Therefore, “outside ” samples taken from basement whole-round samples should be viewed as minimum values. A n interior sample was taken after breaking apart the hard rock sample in the rock box. For all samples, vials were preweighed and then weighed again after sample addition so that concentration s can be mass-normalized. Drilling fluid samples were also collected during Expedition 393 to serv e as controls, as was core liner fluid remaining after pouring out hard rock cores. Similarly, in th e few instances during Expedition 393 when whole-round samples of hard rock had to be cut in th e splitting room using a MK-101 tile saw to either preserve sample ends for petrologic observation s or to shorten long, intact whole-round pieces to the desired length of $10{-}12~\mathrm{cm}$ , samples of th e saw fluid were taken as a control and frozen for further analyses.  

Detection of the tracer was measured after heating at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $10\;\mathrm{min}$ in an oven to evaporate an d release the tracer. Headspace samples were injected into an Agilent Technologies 6890N GC fo r measurement after preparing and running calibration standards using $10^{-4},\,10^{-6},\,10^{-8},$ and $10^{-10}$ dilutions of the tracer.  

# 10.4. Standard microbiology sampling  

For every whole-round sample, subsamples were collected for cell counts and nucleic acid–base d postexpedition analysis. For many samples, additional subsamples were collected for a range o f postexpedition microbiological analyses. Methods for all sampling approaches are describe d below.  

# 10.4.1. Cell and viral counts  

Samples were taken in duplicate for rock samples and triplicate for sediment samples to be able t o cross-calibrate cell counts among different laboratories. A total of $4\,\mathrm{mL}$ of $5\%$ Epredia Formal-Fix x in 3X phosphate buffered solution (Expedition 390) or paraformaldehyde ( $4\%$ solution in $100\;\mathrm{mM}$ phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) was added to autoclaved $7~\mathrm{mL}$ plastic tubes, and $1\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment or powdered rock material was added to each tube, bringing the total volume to $5~\mathrm{mL}$ . During Expedition 390, rocks were crushed into smaller pieces using a clean (autoclaved or ethanol washed and dried) Fisher Scientific CerCo Diamonite mortar and pestle. During Expeditio n 393, small rock chips were selected because the inside of the whole round was broken into smalle r pieces. Preserved samples were stored at $4^{\circ}C$ for onshore analysis using a density gradient separation of cells from rocks and sediments followed by epifluorescence microscopy counts. The protocol used was adapted from Morono et al. (2013) and Li et al. (2020) for microbial cells and Pan e t al. (2019) for viruses.

# 10.4.2. Nucleic acid analyses  

For DNA- and RNA-based analyses, we collected duplicate 10 or $100\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ samples of sediment i n sterile cut-tip syringes for microbial and viral analyses, respectively, and up to $50\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ of materia l from hard rock samples. All samples were placed in sterile plastic centrifuge tubes and then immediately frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . These samples were collected for postexpedition research.  

# 10.5. Nonstandard microbiology sampling  

# 10.5.1. Stable isotope incubations  

Stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments were started during Expedition 390 to determine preferred carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sources used by metabolically active microorganisms in subseafloor sediments and basement rock. Similar methods were used during Expedition 329 t o reveal the presence of active microorganisms in sediments of the South Pacific Gyre as old as 101. 5 Ma (Morono et al., 2020). Samples for SIP incubations were initially handled in the anaerobi c chamber in the microbiology cold room. A total of $15\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment was collected with a steril e cut-tip $20~\mathrm{mL}$ syringe, avoiding the outer edges of the whole-round core, and put into a $50~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ sterile glass vial (Figure F38). Each vial was sealed with a sterile rubber stopper and a screw ca p and then taken outside the anaerobic chamber and flushed with $0.2\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ filter-sterilized nitroge n gas. From here, the vials were transferred to the radioisotope laboratory, where a labeled substrat e ( $^{13}\mathrm{C}$ -labeled sodium bicarbonate, $^{13}\mathrm{C}$ -labeled amino acid mix, and $^{15}\mathrm{N}.$ -labeled ammonium) wa s injected onto each sample using a syringe and needle. Four conditions were tested:  

• No added nutrients (control),   
• $100\;\mathrm{mM}\;^{13}\mathrm{C}$ -labeled amino acid $\mathrm{mix}+10\;\mathrm{mM}\;^{15}\mathrm{N}$ -labeled ${\mathrm{NH}}_{4}{\mathrm{Cl}},$ • $100\;\mathrm{mM}\;^{13}\mathrm{C}$ -labeled $\mathrm{NaHCO_{3}}+10\mathrm{\mM\^{15}N}.$ -labeled $\mathrm{NH}_{4}\mathrm{Cl},$ , and • $10\;\mathrm{mM}\;^{15}\mathrm{N}$ -labeled $\mathrm{NH_{4}C l}$ .  

Half of the samples were kept anaerobic for the duration of the experiment. For the other half,  7 $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of filter-sterilized air was added to compose the microaerobic environment $(3.3\%\mathrm{~O_{2})}$ ). Al l samples were incubated at $4^{\circ}C$ in the radioisotope laboratory. The first time point of individua l experimental vials was fixed by adding $15\,\mathrm{mL}$ of $4\%$ paraformaldehyde in PBS solution after 1 0 days. The remaining three time points will be fixed after the expedition at 30 days, 2 months, an d 6 months. The fixed incubations were frozen at $-80^{\circ}C$ until further processing.

SIP incubation setup for basement samples was conducted in the KOACH bench under aerobi c conditions. Crushed basalt pieces and sterilized artificial seawater were put in a $50~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ steril e glass vial to make a 1:4 slurry (Table T15; Figure F38) with a total volume of $20\,\mathrm{mL}$ . The slurry wa s purged, the headspace was replaced with $\mathrm{N}_{2},$ and then $10~\mathrm{mL}$ of filtered air was injected into th e vial to create a microaerobic environment $(5\%\,\mathrm{O}_{2})$ . The combinations of substrates were the sam e as those for SIP experiments with sediment. Samples were incubated at $10^{\circ}C$ until shipment t o shore at the end of Expedition 390. Individual experimental vials will be fixed at four time point s (2, 3, 6, and 12 months) prior to analysis.  

All experimental tools used for the SIP experiments were sterilized by autoclaving at $121^{\circ}C$ for 2 0 min. Reagents and gas components, including air used for sample preparation, were filtere d through $0.2\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ syringe top filters.  

# 10.5.2. Enrichment experiments  

To enrich and isolate new microbial species during Expedition 390, sediment and hard rock samples were selected for microbial enrichments on agar plates. When recovered material and/or tim e was sufficient for sampling, $1\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment or rock was suspended in $4~\mathrm{mL}$ of sterile artificia l seawater (Table T15). A small amount of the slurry $(100~\upmu\mathrm{L})$ was spread on 1/10 Zobell Marin e Agar 2216 medium (Difco). The Petri dishes were left at $9.5\mathrm{^\circC}$ with the top facing down and the n shipped to shore for postexpedition research.  

Samples were also collected for high-throughput culturing (Mullis et al., 2021). Sediment wa s sampled with a $3\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ syringe, parafilm was wrapped around the top of the syringe, and then th e syringe was placed in a sterile sample bag at $4^{\circ}C.$ . These samples were shipped to shore refrigerate d for postexpedition research.  

For anaerobic sediments, $30{-}70~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ was placed into anaerobic bottles in the anaerobic chambe r with an $\ensuremath{\mathrm{N}}_{2}$ headspace. The bottles were then placed in wine bags with an Anaeropack to remov e oxygen and sealed under a vacuum. Incubations were shipped to shore for initiation of long-ter m enrichments targeted at growing uncultured Archaea.

# 10.5.3. Single-cell genomics and fluorescence-based activity assays  

For single-cell genomics and to determine which microorganisms are metabolically active in sit u and their relative amounts of activity, RedoxSensor Green (RSG; Invitrogen) was used in incubations with samples. Sediment and hard rock samples were processed slightly differently. For sediment samples, $1\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sample was placed in a $15~\mathrm{mL}$ Falcon tube with 1:1 (volume:volume) cold, oxic $1\!\times\!\,\mathrm{PBS}$ buffer containing a $1\times$ concentration of RSG. The sediment and solution were shake n briefly with a vortex mixer. The sample was incubated in a $4^{\circ}C$ refrigerator in the dark for $20\;\mathrm{min}$ , and then $8\;\mathrm{mL}$ of glycerol-tris-ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) buffer was added to th e sample and vortexed to mix. The sample was then flash frozen with liquid $\Nu_{2}$ and stored at $-80^{\circ}C$ until shore-based analysis. An RSG-free sample was also prepared by mixing $1~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sedimen t with $9\,\mathrm{mL}$ of glycerol-tris-EDTA, vortexing to mix, flash freezing in liquid $\mathrm{N}_{2},$ and storing at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ until shore-based analysis. Samples collected from oxygen-free sediment were processed in th e anaerobic chamber prior to flash freezing and storage.  

For hard rock samples, a sterile mortar and pestle were used to homogenize approximately $5\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ of material to a greater extent than was done with the hammers and chisels in the rock box. Fo r activity-based cell sorting using RSG, $1\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of this homogenized rock was added to a $15~\mathrm{mL}$ Falcon tube with 1:1 (volume:volume) cold, oxic $1\!\times\!\mathrm{PBS}$ buffer containing a $1\times$ concentration of RSG. An RSG-free sample was also prepared in the same way as that for the sediment. These sample s were processed as described for the sediment samples. The remaining $3~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ was archived fo r future shore-based analyses by adding $7~\mathrm{mL}$ of glycerol-tris-EDTA, flash freezing with liquid $\mathrm{N}_{2},$ and storing at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

# 10.5.4. Metagenomics in sediment and hard rock  

Metagenomic analysis of microbial community DNA provides information regarding the functional potential of a community. Samples were collected during Expeditions 390 and 393 fo r shore-based analysis of both microbial and viral metagenomics. For sediments, a $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ long (20 0 $\mathsf{c m}^{3},$ ) whole-round sample was collected and stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for shore-based analysis of microbia l prokaryotic metagenomics. For basement samples, at least $50\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ was collected into sterile centrifuge tubes and then frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Samples were shipped frozen to shore for postexpeditio n research. For viral metagenomics in sediment, $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ long $({\sim}100~\mathrm{cm^{3}})$ whole-round core sample s were collected at $20\;\mathrm{m}$ intervals to $100\;\mathrm{m}$ depth, and then two samples were collected per majo r lithology in deeper sections. Viral metagenomics samples were frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and shipped t o shore frozen for postexpedition research.  

# 10.5.5. Lipid sampling in hard rock  

Lipid biomarkers inform analysis of microbial communities and are complementary to DNA- an d RNA-based studies (Li et al., 2020). Samples collected for lipid analysis were wrapped in aluminum foil and then put in bags and vacuum-sealed. These samples were kept at $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ until the y were shipped to shore for postexpedition research.  

# 10.5.6. Sulfate reduction activity  

During Expedition 390, radiolabeled $\left(^{35}\mathrm{S}\right)$ sulfate was used to characterize the rate of sulfate reduction in sediment samples. Whole-round samples were transferred to gas-tight bags, flushed wit h $\Nu_{2}$ gas, heat sealed, and stored at ${\sim}4^{\circ}C$ until they were prepared for radiotracer additions. All vials, caps, bottles, plastic syringes, stoppers, and ceramic knives were autoclaved prior to use, and solutions were either autoclaved or filtered through sterile syringe filters $(0.2\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ . As described below, the potentially contaminated exteriors were removed from whole-round cores, and then subsamples were placed in a vial and amended with sulfate-reducing medium, injected with radiotracer, and incubated for 10 days at approximately in situ temperatures before termination of the experiment. The sulfate-reducing medium was prepared according to procedures used during IOD P Expeditions 370 and 385 (Morono et al., 2017; Teske et al., 2021; Beulig et al., 2022).  

Resazurin was used to indicate the presence of oxygen in incubation and media bottles. It wa s added to the medium, and the bottle was capped loosely before autoclaving. After autoclaving, th e cap was replaced with a sterile butyl stopper and screw cap. The medium was purged with $\Nu_{2}$ ga s while still warm $(>\!60^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ by placing a long syringe needle between the stopper and the wall of th e bottle. After purging, the bottle was sealed with the butyl stopper and cap. Sterile filtered sodiu m bicarbonate $\left(\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}\right)$ ) was injected through the stopper. The $\mathsf{p H}$ of the medium was adjusted t o 7.5 by injection of sterile filtered $6.5\%$ HCl or $\mathrm{{NaOH}}.$ . Sterile filtered $\mathrm{Na_{2}S\mathrm{\cdot9H_{2}O}}$ was then injecte d through the stopper to reduce the medium. Reduction was confirmed by color loss (pink to clear ) of the resazurin in solution.  

Samples were prepared inside an anaerobic chamber $(95{\cdot}5\;[\mathrm{v/v}]\;\mathrm{N_{2}{:}H_{2}})$ . The outermost layer of th e whole-round core and both ends were cut off with a sterile ceramic knife to remove potentiall y contaminated material. A cut-off syringe was used to take $5~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ of mud from the center of eac h whole round. The sediment plug was transferred to a $20~\mathrm{mL}$ crimp-top vial, $5~\mathrm{mL}$ of sulfatereducing medium was added, and the vial was sealed with a nontoxic blue butyl stopper and aluminum crimp cap. The vial headspace was then flushed with $\Nu_{2}$ gas to remove surplus hydrogen. Each sample was prepared in triplicate. In the radioisotope laboratory, the vials were injected wit h $10\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of $^{35}\mathrm{S}$ radiolabeled $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ (3.7 MBq) and then vigorously shaken with a vortex mixer. Samples were incubated at the in situ temperature of $4^{\circ}C$ , as determined by APCT-3 tool measurements. After 10 days of incubation, $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of $20\%$ (w/v) zinc acetate solution was injected into eac h vial to trap $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ gas produced during sulfate reduction. Vials were then thoroughly shaken with  a vortex mixer. The vials were opened, and the sediment slurries were quantitatively transferred t o $50~\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tubes with three rinses of $5~\mathrm{mL}$ $20\%$ zinc acetate solution. The centrifuge tube s were shaken with a vortex mixer and then frozen immediately at $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to stop microbial activity. The samples were shipped to a shore-based laboratory for extraction and analysis following Kallmeyer et al. (2004). Kill controls, sediment controls, medium controls, and drilling fluid control s were taken to test for contamination or abiogenic turnover of sulfur. A kill control was prepare d for approximately every other sample by injecting $5~\mathrm{mL}$ of $20\%$ zinc acetate immediately afte r injection of the radiotracer to stop microbial activity. Sediment controls were incubated withou t radiotracer. The radiotracer was added after microbial activity was stopped to check for reaction s postincubation. Medium controls ( $\mathrm{5~mL}$ of sterile medium, no sediment) and drilling fluid controls $\mathrm{5\;mL}$ of drilling fluid, no sediment) were prepared and incubated with radiotracer added t o check for reactions in the medium and in contaminating drilling fluids. Drilling fluid was also collected after core retrieval from the gap between the core and liner, and additional samples wer e taken directly from the drilling fluid tank.  

# 10.5.7. Ammonium enrichment  

Ammonium enrichment incubation experiments were set up during Expedition 393. About 35–4 0 $\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ of rocks from the interior of the whole-round core sample were crushed using a sterile Fishe r Scientific CerCo Diamonite mortar and pestle. One basement sample and one sediment sampl e were collected from as close as possible to the sediment/basement interface. Serum vials $\left(50\;\mathrm{mL}\right)$ were used for this experiment, with aerobic sterile filtered seawater (SW) as the basal media for al l enrichments (MacLeod et al., 2017). To initiate enrichments, ${\sim}9{-}12\ \mathrm{g}$ of crushed rock chips wer e transferred to serum vials and submerged in SW to a level equivalent to $40\;\mathrm{mL}$ total volume (rock s plus media). These ammonium nutrient addition experiments were coupled with bio-orthogona l noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT). For these enrichments, L-homopropargylglycin e (HPG) was added to the vial at a final concentration of $50\,\upmu\mathrm{M}.$ After adding $\mathrm{NH_{4}C l}$ to a final concentration of $0.4~\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{3}}$ , the vials were sealed with butyl stoppers and allowed to incubate for ${\sim}6$ months at $4^{\circ}C$ . Five treatments were prepared for each selected sample:  

• Crushed rocks in SW and 1.5 mM $\mathrm{NH_{4}C l}$ (no HPG);   
• Crushed rocks in SW, 1.5 mM $\mathrm{NH_{4}C l_{2}}$ , and HPG;   
• Crushed rocks in SW, $0.5\mathrm{\;mM\;NH_{4}C l},$ and HPG;   
• Crushed rocks in SW and HPG (no $\mathrm{NH_{4}C l},$ ); and • Crushed rocks in SW only.  

For each sample and each of these treatments, a killed control was set up using autoclaved rock s from the outer core. Once the incubation period is completed, further analysis will be performe d in the shore-based laboratory at Texas A&M University. This involves ${\mathrm{Cu}}(\mathrm{i})$ -catalyzed click chemistry to be applied to the BONCAT samples following methods outlined by Hatzenpichler an d colleagues (Hatzenpichler et al., 2014, 2016; Hatzenpichler and Orphan, 2015). After clickstaining, the stained cells will be sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Reichart et al., 2020) and the sorted cells will be prepared for sequencing.  

# 10.5.8. Virus-induced microbial mortality and viral production experiments  

For Expedition 393, we used the dilution technique developed for surface sediments (Dell’Anno e t al., 2009) to set up experiments with the goal of determining virus-induced microbial mortalit y and viral production rates from lytic viruses. To compare anaerobic and aerobic conditions, on e set of experiments (Site U1558) was performed in a Coy anaerobic chamber installed on the twee n deck flushed with $\ensuremath{\mathrm{N}}_{2}$ . The other experiments were performed in the KOACH bench under steril e aerobic conditions. Sediment samples $(10\;\mathsf{c m}^{3})$ ) were subsampled with a cut-off syringe and the n diluted with autoclaved seawater. Seawater used for sample dilution was collected either from surface water, using a field-rinsed bucket attached to a rope, or near the seafloor using the Niski n bottle attached to the subsea camera system frame. Experiments were set up in duplicate in $50\;\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tubes. Samples were incubated anaerobically inside the chamber (room temperature o f ${\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . In duplicate, $1~\mathrm{mL}$ samples were taken at $t=0$ , 6, 12, 24, and $48~\mathrm{h}$ and 7 and 14 days i n sterile cryotubes. Each sample was fixed with paraformaldehyde (final concentration $2\%$ ), incubated $10\ \mathrm{min}$ at $4^{\circ}C_{:}$ , and frozen at $-80^{\circ}C$ to be further processed in the shore-based laborator y (Texas A&M University at Galveston [USA]). Cell and viral counts will be performed using epifluorescence microscopy following Pan et al. (2019). The remaining material from the incubation s was shipped to the shore-based laboratory for total DNA extraction and metagenomic sequencing.  

# 10.5.9. Prophage induction  

For Expedition 393, we induced prophages to determine the extent of lysogeny in sediment. T o compare anaerobic and aerobic conditions, one set of experiments (Site U1558) was performed i n a Coy anaerobic chamber installed on the tween deck flushed with $\Nu_{2}$ . The other experiment s were performed in the KOACH bench under sterile aerobic conditions. Samples $(10~\mathsf{c m}^{3})$ ) wer e diluted 1:1 $(\mathbf{v}/\mathbf{v})$ in autoclaved seawater supplemented with Mitomycin C $\mathrm{[1~\upmug/mL}$ final concentration in $0.02~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ prefiltered seawater). Experiments were set up in duplicate in $50~\mathrm{mL}$ Falco n tubes. In duplicate, $1\,\mathrm{mL}$ samples were taken at $\scriptstyle t\,=\,0$ , 6, 12, 24, and $48\,\mathrm{h}$ and 7 and 14 days in steril e cryotubes. Each sample was fixed with paraformaldehyde (final concentration $2\%$ ), incubated 1 0 min at $4^{\circ}C$ , and frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to be further processed in the shore-based laboratory (Texas A& M University at Galveston). Cell and viral counts will be performed using epifluorescence microscopy following Pan et al. (2019). The remaining material from the incubations were shipped t o the shore laboratory for total DNA extraction and metagenomic sequencing.
