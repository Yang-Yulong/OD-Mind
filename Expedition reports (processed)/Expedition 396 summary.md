# Abstract  

The opening of the northeast Atlantic, starting around 56 My ago, was associated with th e emplacement of the North Atlantic Igneous Province, including the deposition of voluminou s extrusive basaltic successions and intrusion of magma into the surrounding sedimentary basins. The mid-Norwegian Margin is a global type example of such a volcanic rifted margin and is wel l suited for scientific drilling with its thin sediment cover and good data coverage. During International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 396, 21 boreholes were drilled at 10 sites in five different geological settings on the mid-Norwegian Margin. The boreholes sampled a wide variety o f igneous and sedimentary settings ranging from lava flow fields to hydrothermal vent complexes, along with thick successions of Upper Paleocene and Lower Eocene strata. A comprehensive suit e of wireline logs was collected in eight boreholes. These data provide new constraints for geodynamic models to explain the rapid emplacement of large igneous provinces and will also allow u s to test the hypothesis that the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) was caused b y hydrothermal release of carbon in response to magmatic intrusions and/or flood basalt eruption. Successful drilling and high core recovery of target intervals at all nine primary sites and one additional alternate site will allow us to achieve these goals during postcruise work. Expedition 39 6 highlights include (1) drilling and coring a unique, multihole transect across a supra-sill hydrothermal system and crater that was filled in during the PETM, (2) drilling and coring all the majo r lithofacies at each of the component parts of a volcanic rifted margin from terrestrial to dee p marine, and (3) acquiring excellent petrophysical data and imaging support for core analyses o f complex and diverse volcanic and volcaniclastic intervals across the terrestrial to marine transition.  

# 1. Introduction  

Continental extension, breakup, and the formation of new mid-oceanic spreading centers are fundamental parts of the plate tectonic cycle and have wide implications for the global environmen t (Berndt et al., 2019). Rifted margin studies have been at the core of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) and its predecessors since the 1960s. Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP ) and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) drilling, along with extensive seismic surveying of the northeast Atlantic conjugate margins, demonstrated anomalously high volcanic activity during continental breakup. This led to the classification of these margins as volcanic rifted margins (Talwan i and Eldholm, 1977; Eldholm et al., 1987, 1989; Saunders et al., 1998; Sengör and Burke, 1978; Ziegler and Cloetingh, 2004; Abdelmalak et al., 2016a, 2016b) (Figure F1).  

Expedition 396 builds on previous successful drilling campaigns in the northeast Atlantic (DSD P Leg 38 [1974] and ODP Legs 104 [1985], 152 [1993], and 163 [1995]) that were instrumental i n developing the concepts of volcanic rifted margins and large igneous provinces (LIPs) (se e Mahoney and Coffin [1997], Ernst [2014], and Svensen et al. [2019] for a summary). There are, however, many unresolved scientific questions related to the formation and environmental implications of breakup volcanism that can only be addressed by new scientific drilling.  

Despite unsurpassed constraints on conjugate crustal structure between the northeast Atlanti c Norwegian, Jan Mayen, and Greenland rifted margins, the mechanisms behind rift-related, anomalously voluminous magmatic productivity are still debated (Lundin and Doré, 2005; Brown an d

Lesher, 2014; Foulger et al., 2020; Lu and Huismans, 2021). The controversy centers on three competing hypotheses:  

• Excess magmatism derived from elevated mantle potential temperatures resulting from mantle plume processes;   
• Small-scale convection at the base of the lithosphere enhancing the flux of material through the melt window during rifting and breakup; and   
• Mantle source heterogeneity contributing to anomalously high melt production during continental breakup.  

Although the mantle plume mechanism requires anomalously high temperatures resulting in hig h degrees of partial melting during asthenosphere upwelling, small-scale convection at the base o f the lithosphere operates without involving significantly elevated potential temperatures and is inherently connected to the rifting process (Boutilier and Keen, 1999).  

Temporal correlations between mass extinctions, global warming, and formation of LIPs have lon g been recognized but rarely demonstrated (e.g., only in the case of the late Permian extinctions ) (Vogt, 1972; Eldholm and Thomas, 1993; Wignall, 2001). However, the reasons for related paleoenvironmental crises are highly debated (Bond and Wignall, 2014; Courtillot and Renne, 2003). For example, volcanic eruptions release large volumes of sulfur, halogens, and carbon to the atmosphere (Jones et al., 2016), which may cause environmental disturbances on a variety of timescales. A potential complementary but perhaps asynchronous mechanism is that large volumes of greenhouse gases can be released from metamorphic aureoles around sill intrusions emplaced in sedimentary basins (Svensen et al., 2004). New information on eruption styles, volumes and rates, an d sedimentological data in a proximal region to the eruptions is important to document and understand the environmental impact of LIP emplacement.  

# 2. Background  

Scientific drilling of northeast Atlantic continental margins since the 1970s has been essential fo r understanding the architecture and implications of igneous deposits associated with continenta l breakup. In particular, drilling of deep boreholes in the feather edge of the seaward-dipping reflectors (SDR) offshore mid-Norway and southeast Greenland (Eldholm et al., 1989; Larsen, Saunders, Clift, et al., 1994; Duncan, Larsen, Allan, et al., 1996; Saunders et al., 1998; Larsen et al., 1999 ) demonstrated that voluminous subaerial volcanic sequences are common along rifted margins. The drilling results further suggested that continental breakup magmatism has had a majo r impact on the global environment and mass extinctions (Hinz, 1981; Eldholm and Thomas, 1993). Interpretation of oil and gas industry seismic and borehole data from the Vøring Basin led to th e hypothesis that voluminous intrusion of magma in organic-rich sedimentary basin deposits ma y have triggered the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) by release of aureole gase s through hydrothermal vent complexes (Svensen et al., 2004). This hypothesis will be tested wit h the results of Expedition 396.  

Breakup volcanism along rifted margins is highly variable in both time and space. Mantle meltin g during the formation of mid-oceanic ridges is relatively well understood and mostly a function o f spreading rate and mantle potential temperature. It leads to accretion of $6{-}8\ \mathrm{km}$ of magmati c crust at standard mantle potential temperature and full spreading rates greater than $2\,\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{y}$ (Bow n and White, 1994). On the other hand, factors controlling magmatic activity during continenta l rifting and breakup are not well known. The variation in the degree of magmatism at rifted margins can, to the first order, be characterized in three contrasting modes of behavior (e.g., Huisman s and Beaumont, 2011, 2014; Lu and Huismans, 2021). Mode 1 margins are characterized by a shar p transition from the continent/ocean boundary (COB) to normal thickness $(6{-}8\ \mathrm{km})$ magmati c ocean crust. At Mode 2 margins, magmatic productivity exceeds that expected from decompression melting at normal mantle temperature. Mode 3 margins have little to no magmatism at th e COB and a broad transition zone with an exposed mantle at the seafloor preceding formation o f mature oceanic crust.  

A comprehensive understanding of what controls this range of behaviors and the volume, distribution, and timing of magmatism during continental rifting and breakup is, however, lacking. Magmatic crustal thickening at Mode 2 margins often exceeds $20\,\mathrm{km}$ , more than three times as thick a s normal oceanic crust produced by passive upwelling of normal potential temperature mantle (i.e., Mode 1). This excess magmatism has been related to both mantle plume and contrasting nonplume mechanisms (McKenzie and Bickle, 1988; Mutter et al., 1988; White and McKenzie, 1989). Continental breakup is often associated with extensive volcanism over large distances along strik e of the rifted margins, as exemplified in the northeast Atlantic (Figure F1). Magmatic product s emplaced along these volcanic rifted margins have four major characteristics:  

• Wedges of SDR and associated volcanic seismic facies units interpreted to be massive, subaerial and submarine lava flows and volcaniclastic sediments are found on both sides of the COB;   
• Extensive sill and hydrothermal vent complexes are emplaced in organic-rich sedimentary basins around the incipient breakup axis;   
• Thick, high–seismic velocity bodies are found in the lower crust along the COB and commonly interpreted to be magmatic underplated material; and   
• Extensive pre- to synrifting volcanic sequences that comprise subaerial lava flows, lava deltas, and volcaniclastic sediments are found.  

It appears that volcanic rifted margins require mantle that is either anomalously hot, actively upwelling at rates higher than the plate half-spreading rate, anomalously fertile, or some combinatio n of these factors.  

# 2.1. Geological setting  

The northeast Atlantic rift system developed as a result of a series of rift episodes succeeding th e Caledonian orogeny that ultimately led to continental breakup and passive margin formation i n the earliest Eocene (Talwani and Eldholm, 1977; White and McKenzie, 1989; Skogseid et al., 2000; Abdelmalak et al., 2016a; Zastrozhnov et al., 2020). The mid-Norwegian Margin is well covered b y 2-D and 3-D reflection and refraction seismic surveys, potential field and heat flow data, and borehole data that allow a refined structural and stratigraphic framework (Figure F2) (Brekke, 2000; Gernigon et al., 2003, 2020, 2021; Mjelde et al., 2005; Breivik et al., 2006; Theissen-Krah et al., 2017; Zastrozhnov et al., 2018, 2020; Polteau et al., 2020).  

The mid-Norwegian Margin is segmented by the northwest-trending Jan Mayen Fracture Zone, which separates the Møre and Vøring Margins (Figure F3). The margin segments are characterized by different tectonomagmatic styles and sediment distributions (Berndt et al., 2001a; Gernigon et al., 2020). The largest magmatic accumulation is observed in the Vøring segment, an d volumes decrease to the south and north (Millett et al., 2022). In the southern segment, passiv e margin formation and oceanic spreading was accommodated by the Aegir Ridge between th e Møre and Jan Mayen (at the time connected to Greenland) conjugate margins in the Paleocen e and Eocene.  

Rifting and passive margin formation in the northeast Atlantic was accompanied by strong volcanic activity (White and McKenzie, 1989; Eldholm and Grue, 1994; Larsen and Saunders, 1998; Wright et al., 2012). Evidence for extensive magmatism is provided by SDR, magmatic intrusions, and high-velocity bodies at the base of the continental crust underlying the COB, which in the distal margin are unequivocally interpreted to be magmatic underplate (Figures F2, F3) (Berndt et al., 2001a; Mjelde et al., 2005; Planke et al., 2005). ODP drilling of the Vøring Margin (Leg 104) and off southeast Greenland (Legs 152 and 163) recovered volcanic rock successions erupted during the initial stages of opening of the northeast Atlantic. Drilled rocks range from prebreakup continental tholeiitic flood basalt to synbreakup picrites to oceanic-type basalts that form the main part of the SDR (Fitton et al., 2000). Oceanic-type lavas show an increasing degree of melting and contribution from asthenospheric mantle sources with time (Fram et al., 1998; Fitton et al., 1998). The thickness of igneous crust accreted at the southeast Greenland COB increases from about $18\;\mathrm{km}$ in the south to about $30~\mathrm{km}$ near the Greenland-Iceland Rise (Holbrook et al., 2001). Similarly, geochemical enrichment of volcanic rocks of the East Greenland Margin (chondrite-normalize d $\mathrm{[Ce/Y]N}$ and isotopes; Fitton et al., 1998; Tegner et al., 1998; Brown and Lesher, 2014) increase s from south to north. In addition to scientific drilling results, evidence from the thick onshor e Faroe Islands and East Greenland exposures reveal a temporal evolution that supports fluctuations in mantle potential temperature with time (e.g., Tegner et al., 1998; Millett et al., 2020). Temporal fluctuations in mantle potential temperature are also invoked from independent geophysica l observations, which reveal major uplift and subsidence events during the North Atlantic Igneou s Province (NAIP) history that have been invoked as evidence for plume pulsing within the provinc e (e.g., Champion et al., 2008; Hartley et al., 2011; Parnell-Turner et al., 2014).

Correlation of crustal thickness and compositional enrichment suggests a combination of change s in source composition, source temperature, and/or melting dynamics (e.g., Hole and Millett, 2016; Hole and Natland, 2020). It is not known whether a similar correlation of crustal thicknesses an d magma compositions exists along the Norwegian Margin. To establish the relationship betwee n chemistry of the volcanic successions and crustal configuration is a milestone of the propose d investigations. Geochemical data show strong chemical and isotopic similarities between th e upper series from the Vøring Plateau and southeast Greenland. In contrast, the lower series fro m both areas are fundamentally different from each other in many aspects, pointing to either substantial differences in prebreakup lithosphere composition at the two localities or different style s of mantle-crust interaction (Abdelmalak et al., 2016a).  

Periods of elevated magmatism such as the emplacement of the NAIP often coincide with considerable environmental perturbations. This may include short-term events such as the PETM (5 6 Ma) or long-term climate warming such as the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) $_{\sim50-53}$ Ma) (Bond and Wignall, 2014; Eldholm and Thomas, 1993), or both. The total volume of magm a emplaced during the Paleogene is estimated to be $6{-}10\times10^{6}\,\mathrm{km}^{3}$ (Saunders et al., 2007; Horni e t al., 2017), with the most voluminous activity roughly coinciding with the Paleocene/Eocen e boundary (Storey et al., $2007\mathbf{a},$ , although volcanism associated with the province spans ${>}10$ My (Wilkinson et al., 2017). Greenhouse gas emissions were likely generated by magmatic degassin g (Storey et al., 2007b; Gutjahr et al., 2017) and by explosive discharge of thermogenic gases generated by contact metamorphism (Svensen et al., 2004; Frieling et al., 2016; Aarnes et al., 2010). Therefore, the emplacement of the NAIP is one of the primary contenders for instigating hyperthermal events and long-term warming in the Paleogene, either as a direct forcing or as an initiator of positive climate feedbacks such as methane hydrate dissociation.  

# 3. Scientific objectives  

The key objectives of Expedition 396 are (1) to understand the relationship between rifting, exces s magmatism, and paleoclimate and (2) to resolve the relative contribution from plume upwelling, small-scale convection, and mantle heterogeneity and their relation to the formation of the northeast Atlantic volcanic rifted margins. This requires additional constraints on the following:  

• Melting conditions (degree, pressure, and temperature of melting);   
• Age distribution of volcanic products, which is essential to constrain magmatic productivity in time and space;   
• Variation of pre-, syn-, and postbreakup magmatic activity across the margin;   
• Variation of magmatic activity along strike across the major Møre and Vøring Margin segments;   
• Eruption rates, environment, and volcanic morphologies; and   
• The relationship between climate change and timing, volume, and style of magma emplacement.  

The sedimentary proxy-based environmental reconstructions provide a semiquantitative recor d of paleobathymetry (water depth) and vertical motion as early rifting progressed to seafloo r spreading, with the potential additional influence of dynamic support originating from the plumepulsing hypothesis (e.g., Champion et al., 2008; Parnell-Turner et al., 2014).  

Sampling of breakup volcanic successions and proximal sediment cores through IODP drilling, i n conjunction with geochemical constraints on melt conditions and integrated quantitative model s of melting and mantle convection, is crucial to advance our understanding of breakup processe s and resolve competing hypotheses for excess magmatism and paleoenvironmental consequences.  

The mid-Norwegian Margin is a unique area in which well-characterized volcanic features relate d to volcanic rifted margins worldwide are readily drillable (Figure F3). Here, igneous rocks an d Paleogene sediments are locally buried by thin postbreakup sediment cover. Large regions alon g the outer margins have recently been covered by industry 3-D seismic surveys, and this uniqu e database allows the identification of shallow $\left.<200\right.$ meters below seafloor [mbsf]) volcanic an d Paleogene sedimentary targets (Millett et al., 2022).  

There were seven scientific objectives for Expedition 396, divided into primary and secondar y objectives:  

Objective 1 (primary) was to determine the role of the Iceland plume in producing excess magm a along the mid-Norwegian segment of the northeast Atlantic volcanic rifted margin during th e Paleogene by constraining the conditions of melting (temperature, pressure, mantle sources, an d total degree of melting).  

Objective 2 (primary) was to determine the cause for along-axis variation in melt production. I n the case of the northeast Atlantic volcanic margins, magmatic productivity changes from th e Møre Margin $\scriptstyle\sim12-15\;\mathrm{km}$ thick magmatic crust) in the south toward the Vøring Margin $>\!20\,\mathrm{km}$ thick magmatic crust) and the Lofoten Margin ( $\mathbf{\left\langle{\sim8}\ k m\right.}$ regular thickness magmatic crust). Thi s pattern suggests a local, structural control because models of plume behavior would suggest th e largest excess magmatic activity is at the southernmost conjugate sections (e.g., Møre–Jan Mayen ) closest to the Iceland thermal anomaly.  

Objective 3 (primary) was to determine the environment (subaerial versus submarine) in whic h the Inner and Outer SDR and the implications for vertical crustal motions during late synrift, breakup, and early postrift oceanic spreading. Some of the lava flows may not have erupted subaerially (e.g., Planke et al., 2000, 2017). This has important implications for the distribution o f buoyancy forces and isostasy during breakup where sections without continental crust would, under normal conditions, be expected at water depths $>\!2\,\mathrm{km}$ (e.g., Kusznir et al., 2004).  

Objective 4 (primary) was to determine the timing of magmatic activity and potential relationship(s) through analysis of a large variety of paleoenvironmental proxies proximal to the NAIP.  

Objective 5 (primary) was to use the integrated paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental proxies, and geochronological data, to assess the relative importance of volcanism and thermogenic releas e from hydrothermal vent complexes as potential drivers of climate change events.  

Objective 6 (secondary) was to study Early Eocene hothouse and freshwater incursions into th e North Atlantic. The early Paleogene $({\sim}66{-}45\ \mathrm{Ma})$ was characterized by warm global greenhous e conditions culminating in the EECO $({\sim}53{-}50\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , the warmest sustained climates of the last 6 5 My (Bijl et al., 2009; Anagnostou et al., 2016; Cramwinckel et al., 2018), inducing an intensifie d hydrological cycle with strongly increased precipitation at high latitudes (e.g., Pagani et al., 2006; Suan et al., 2017). Paleogene sediments obtained during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 302 (Arctic Coring Expedition) show large quantities of free-floating freshwater Azolla, which grew and reproduced in the Arctic Ocean by the latest early to earliest Middle Eocene ( $[{\sim}48\,\$ Ma; Brinkhuis et al., 2006). The newly drilled sites penetrate Eocene sediments and will allow testing of the extent of freshwater incursions, constraining paleoceanographic boundary condition s for the incursions, including the evolution of oceanic gateways and their influence on global ocea n circulation. The Early Eocene sediments also provide a unique opportunity to reconstruct northern mid–high latitude climate, allowing a detailed comparison to Southern Ocean records (e.g., Bijl et al., 2009, 2013; Hollis et al., 2012).  

Objective 7 (secondary) was to study carbon capture and storage in basalt provinces. Industrialscale injection of $C O_{2}$ into volcanic reservoirs has been developed in recent years with test sites in Iceland (Matter et al., 2016) and Washington State (USA; McGrail et al., 2011). Carbon captur e and storage is an integral component of meeting climate change targets of the Intergovernmenta l Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and as such, the extensive offshore volcanic sequences of th e mid-Norwegian volcanic rifted margin form potential storage targets (Planke et al., 2021). Bette r petrophysical and geophysical constraints on the volcanic rock sequences collected during Expedition 396 are needed to effectively appraise the reservoir properties and storage potential in thi s area.  

Observations of meteoric water and high dissolved calcium concentration from the bottom o f ODP Sites 642 and 643 show that the Vøring Plateau is ideal for studying circulation of freshwate r in such large basaltic formations and assessing its potential for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ sequestration. Previous OD P holes did not address the origin of meteoric water and trigger(s) for such large-scale circulation. Dating of borehole water samples with $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ , $^{36}\mathrm{Cl}$ , and $^{234}\mathrm{U}/^{238}\mathrm{U}$ tracers and systematic analyses o f fluid geochemistry (Inagaki et al., 2015) will allow the determination of the source of meteori c waters and provide constraints on their circulation systems, which are crucial for assessing th e $C O_{2}$ storage potential of breakup basalts. Pore fluids have been sampled along the complete drilling transect to investigate the potential extent of meteoric water flow. The outcome of fluid geochemical analyses will be quantitatively interpreted with hydrological modeling using softwar e such as MODFLOW to investigate the flow path of meteoric water. The sampling for water geochemistry will follow the standard IODP protocol for pore fluid analyses.  

# 4. Operations and coring strategy  

The mid-Norwegian Margin is the type locality for volcanic rifted margins and is probably the bes t studied volcanic margin worldwide. The detailed geometry and amount of volcanic products in th e form of underplated bodies and intrusive and extrusive volcanic rocks are well constrained throug h geophysical imaging (e.g., Mjelde et al., 2005; Berndt et al., 2001b; Planke et al., 2017; Abdelmalak e t al., 2016a, 2016b, 2017). However, new information on the age, nature, and depositional environment of the volcanic rocks is required to constrain melt production rates and vertical motions.  

Answering the fundamental questions outlined in the scientific objectives required extensive sampling of both late synrift/early postrift sediments and magmatic products from the continenta l into the oceanic domain (Figures F2, F3). Collection of sedimentary records proximal to the volcanic and magmatic activity will allow the application of numerous proxies (e.g., geochemical an d sedimentological) to distinguish between volcanic and hydrothermal vent complex sources.  

The expedition sites were located based on interpretation of very extensive high-quality moder n 3-D data, and locally, 2-D profiles where 3-D data did not exist (Millett et al., 2022; Gernigon et al., 2021). All proposed sites were located in regions with thin post-Eocene sediments. Site-specifi c high-resolution 2-D and 3-D P-Cable seismic data were subsequently acquired in 2020 across si x of the approved sites (Bünz et al., 2020).  

The expedition boreholes are located along three transects:  

• The Modgunn transect targets the crater of a hydrothermal vent complex. Five boreholes were drilled at two sites.   
• The Mimir transect targets Paleogene sediments and the PETM. Five boreholes were drilled at two sites.   
• The basement transect (Kolga, Skoll, Eldhø, and Lofoten Basin areas) targeted both basalt and interbasaltic sediments, prebasalt, and postbasalt sequences. Eleven boreholes were drilled at six sites.  

Drilling was highly successful, with clement weather, smooth operations, and good core recovery. In total, 21 holes were drilled at 10 different sites (Table T1). The total drilling depth was $3950\;\mathrm{m}$ , including more than $600\,\mathrm{m}$ of basement rocks. Overall recovery was $57\%$ ; however, the recovery o f key PETM and basalt stratigraphic intervals was as high as $78\%$ and $61\%$ , respectively. A comprehensive suite of wireline logs were collected in eight boreholes, with a logged interval of $913\;\mathrm{m}$ .  A summary of the drilling and logging results from the sites are presented in Figure F4 and locate d on a cross-section of the volcanic margin in Figure F2. The coring results for each of the mai n recovered stratigraphic units are presented in Table T2, and a summary of the wireline loggin g intervals is presented in Table T3.  

Paleogene sediments were drilled along the 1 and 3 km long Modgunn and Mimir transects (Figure s F5, F6). Initially, the primary sites were drilled in both these areas. Preliminary results from the corin g operations, including palynological analyses and physical property interpretations, were integrate d with revised interpretation of the high-resolution P-Cable 3-D seismic data to refine the location o f additional holes to optimize recovery of the targeted sedimentary strata (e.g., the PETM interval).  

The drilling strategy for the basement transect was somewhat more complicated because severa l different areas along the margin were targeted (Figure F3). The two Kolga sites targeted subbasal t and initial basalt sequences, followed by the two Skoll sites, which targeted different volcanic seismic facies units and sequences near the feather-edge of the SDR (Figure F7A). Farther north, th e Eldhø (Figure F7B) and Lofoten Basin sites targeted the characteristic Outer High and Outer SD R volcanic seismic facies units, respectively. A summary of the drilling and logging results from th e sites are presented in Figure F4.  

All basement sites were initially drilled using the rotary core barrel (RCB) coring system for optimal basalt recovery (Figure F4). The main site objectives were typically $100\,\mathrm{m}$ of basement drillin g or drilling to bit destruction. Half-coring was used extensively in the basement intervals t o improve recovery. Wireline logs were acquired in most basement holes; the main objective was t o image interbasaltic sediments and fracture intervals that are difficult to recover with the RCB system. The advanced piston corer (APC) and extended core barrel (XCB) coring systems were use d at three basement sites (two at Skoll and Eldhø) to optimize recovery of the Eocene sedimentar y rocks. APC coring was guided and constrained by results from the somewhat limited recovery i n previously drilled RCB holes at each site. Half-length APC (HLAPC) coring was used extensivel y to ensure high recovery in critical intervals (Figure F8). This approach gave an almost complet e recovery of the postbasalt sediments at two sites.

The typical IODP shipboard workflow, including core description, imaging, physical property measurements, and geochemical analyses of rocks and fluids, was followed by the shipboard scientist s and IODP staff. Headspace gas was routinely analyzed for safety reasons. Interstitial water (IW) an d microbiological samples were also obtained soon after core recovery. Table T4 gives an overview o f the comprehensive amount of data acquired in the targeted stratigraphic intervals during the cruise. Figures F9, F10, F11, F12, and F13 highlight results from the different shipboard laboratories (biostratigraphy, core description, geochemistry, wireline logging, and paleomagnetism groups).

# 5.1. Site U1565  

Two short holes were drilled at Site U1565 to determine the nature of the subbasalt basement i n the western part of the Kolga High. Both holes recovered altered granitic basement below ${\sim}25~\mathrm{m}$ of Quaternary sediments.  

# 5.1.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1565 is located at 2071 meters below sea level (mbsl) on the western flank of the Kolga High, a pronounced structural high in the Jan Mayen Corridor (Figure F14). The site was located using  a combination of conventional 3-D and high-resolution seismic data. Comprehensive 3-D seismi c mapping shows that the Kolga High is covered by a variable-thickness Paleogene basalt unit overlying a complex and previously untested subbasalt sequence that had been interpreted as potentially sedimentary because of the presence of local intrusions of Paleogene sills and dikes (Millet t et al., 2022; Zastrozhnov et al., 2020). SDR wedges exist on the Møre Marginal High toward th e south, and similar but smaller seismic reflections lap onto the western part of the Kolga High.  A classic lava delta and escarpment defines the eastern limit of the high. The basalt cover is absent i n two small $\left^{\prime}5\,\mathrm{km}\times3\,\mathrm{km}$ sized) areas just west of the summit of the Kolga High (Millett et al., 2022). Here, the seismic data show a transparent seismic basement that extends down to a strong seismi c reflection at about $7.5~\mathbf{s}$ two-way traveltime (TWT). The gap in the basalt cover makes the Kolg a High a unique place on the Vøring and Møre Margins where the subbasalt sequence can be sampled with shallow coring.  

The primary objective of Site U1565 was to core and sample the subbasalt geology that is largel y unconstrained along the mid-Norwegian Margin. Sampling the subbasalt succession would provide important constraints on the rifting history both in time and space, as well as constraints o n the vertical movements of this margin segment prior to breakup (Gernigon et al., 2015, 2020). W e expected to sample the subbasalt rocks after penetrating about $25{-}30\;\mathrm{m}$ of Quaternary sediments. The plan was to core for 2 days or to a maximum depth of 200 mbsf to recover representativ e samples of the basement rocks to characterize the lithologies and alternation. We encountere d altered granitic basement immediately below the soft-sediment cover in Hole U1565A; therefore, we decided to drill a second hole approximately $140~\mathrm{m}$ west to verify the lateral continuity of th e basement rocks rather than spending time deepening the initial hole at a very low penetration rate.

# 5.1.2. Operations  

Site U1565 consists of two shallow holes. Hole U1565A was cored using the RCB system to 28. 0 mbsf. Coring was stopped because of very slow penetration rates while drilling into granitoid tha t was sampled in Cores 3R and 4R. With the objective to confirm the lateral extent of the granite, Hole U1565B was added. This hole was drilled $138\;\mathrm{m}$ west-northwest of the first hole in the direction of the next site (U1566). Hole U1565B was cored to 31.7 mbsf and yielded core material similar to that recovered in Hole U1565A. Operations were ended at $0215~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 August 2021, an d the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor to begin the short transit of $900\;\mathrm{m}$ to the next site.  

Nine cores were recorded for the site. The RCB system was used exclusively (Figure F4). It core d $59.7~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $19.66\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(32.9\%)$ . A total of $34.25~\mathrm{h}$ or 1.4 days were spent on Sit e U1565.  

# 5.1.3. Principal results  

# 5.1.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The lithology of Holes U1565A and U1565B is divided into two lithostratigraphic units. Unit  I consists of unconsolidated sediment, and Unit II consists of altered monzogranite. The boundar y between the two units was determined using the drilling data where the bit depth shows a shar p decrease in the rate of penetration from about 15 to $1{-}2~\mathrm{m/h}$ at 20.9 mbsf in U1565A and 28. 0 mbsf in U1565B. The thicknesses of granite drilled in Holes U1565A and U1565B are 7.1 and 3. 6 m, respectively. Unit I is $7.1\textrm{m}$ thinner in Hole U1565A than in Hole U1565B. High-resolutio n seismic data show that the expected sediment thickness is the same in both holes. The thicknes s discrepancy in the drilling data is attributed to uncertainties in the determination of the seabe d depth for RCB drilling because seabed depth was determined using the increase in torque in Hol e U1565A and the mudline recovery in Hole U1565B.  

Unit I sediments in Hole U1565A are primarily composed of olive brown to reddish brown clay, whereas Unit I in Hole U1565B is mainly composed of brown, grayish brown to dark gray clay. Generally, this unit contains varying amounts of silt, sand, calcareous nannofossils, and planktoni c foraminifers, and diatoms are common in the first core section of Hole U1565A. Amphibolite an d granite dropstones also are observed in this core. The unit is typically moderately to very wel l sorted. Smear slide analyses indicate that Unit I consists of abundant undifferentiated clay-size d minerals, rare to trace foraminifers and nannofossils with larger silt- and sand-sized grains comprised of common quartz and undifferentiated feldspar, and rare lithics. Trace amounts of diatoms, zircon, chlorite, and glauconite are also present. Slight to moderate drilling disturbance s were observed in parts of the unit. The base of Unit I in Hole U1565B, which lies directly abov e Unit II, consists of a mixture of sand, subrounded yellow brown clay clasts, and granules t o medium pebbles with a poorly sorted grain size. Smear slide analysis of matrix material from thi s interval indicates abundant undifferentiated clay-sized minerals with rare nannofossils, rar e organic debris, and trace diatoms. Silt and sand grains consist of common undifferentiated feldspar, rare quartz, and rare lithics. Dark gray polymetallic concentric nodules were observed at th e base of Unit I in Hole U1565A (interval 2R-1, $75{-}79\,\mathrm{cm}$ ). Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) dat a collected from nodules at ${\sim}5.80$ mbsf (Section 2R-CC) show that their composition consists of lo w to moderate concentrations of transition metals $(10.7\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ $\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3},$ 2.6 wt% ${\cal M}{\bf n}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3},$ 210 ppm Ni, 8 0 ppm ${\mathrm{Cu}},$ and $94{\mathrm{~ppm}}\,{\mathrm{Zn}})$ ). The silica content $(\sim\!35\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ is considered relatively high for such nodules and suggests the presence of clay materials.  

The Unit I–II transition was not retrieved in Hole U1565A. Based on the low penetration rate s and drilling data, we cored $7.1\;\mathrm{m}$ into Unit II in Hole U1565A, recovering more than $3\;\mathrm{m}$ of granite. In Hole U1565B, the transition between the two units was recovered in Core 4R, and we core d $3.6~\mathrm{m}$ into the basement, recovering only 10 pebbles and a $10~\mathrm{cm}$ core of highly altered granit e conglomerate. Unit II represents one igneous unit consisting of moderately to highly altere d medium-grained biotite monzogranite with local, fine-grained mafic and felsic enclaves (Figur e  

F10G). Throughout Unit II, the monzogranite rocks remain mineralogically and texturally consistent. Observations of two thin sections confirmed the mineralogy and pervasive alteratio n observed at macroscopic scale. Alkali feldspars are generally partially or totally replaced by undetermined brownish clay minerals and zeolite. Biotite grains show coronae of limonite.  

# 5.1.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

Unconsolidated mixed gray and brown sands, silts, and clays with intervals containing gravel an d larger clasts, interpreted as ice-rafted detritus, were recovered from Lithostratigraphic Unit I i n Holes U1565A and U1565B. Clay- and silt-rich samples from Sections 396-U1565A-1R-C C through 2R-CC and 396-U1565B-1R-CC through 4R-CC were analyzed for microfossil content. All sedimentary samples yield common to trace diatoms, in situ and reworked dinoflagellate cysts, reworked sporomorphs, rare ostracods, common to trace benthic foraminifers, and commo n planktonic foraminifers. The age diagnostic microfossils indicate an overall Quaternary age. I n addition, palynomorphs (mainly dinocysts) indicate reworking from Paleogene and (Lower ) Cretaceous strata, and pollen and spores also indicate reworking from Lower Cretaceous rocks. Diatoms and foraminifers are common in the mudline samples and suggest a Middle Pleistocene– Holocene age.  

# 5.1.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I sediments show consistent and continuous variations in inclination an d intensity despite drilling disturbance. Some of the locally high values of magnetic inclinatio n $(>\!80^{\circ})$ might be due to drilling-induced magnetization. The sediments have an average intensity o f ${\sim}3.6\times10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ , a magnetic susceptibility (MS; κ) of ${\sim}707\times10^{-6}$ [SI], and a low magnetic anisotropy $\left({P^{\prime}}\right)$ $(\mathord{\sim}1.001)$ ). The nonhorizontal magnetic foliation suggests drilling disturbance. In Hole s U1565A and U1565B, the geomagnetic polarity is normal, except at 5.58–5.78 mbsf in Hol e U1565A, where a magnetic reversal may occur. The sediments have higher magnetic coercivit y than the granites. One discrete sample shows limited demagnetization up to a field of $100~\mathrm{{mT}}$ indicative of a high-coercivity magnetic phase (goethite or hematite) and confirms the norma l polarity of this interval.  

Granites in Unit II have an average magnetic intensity of $1.17\,\times\,10^{-2}\,\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m},$ , likely due to loss o f magnetite through alteration, MS of $212\times10^{-6}$ [SI], and low $P^{\prime}$ $(\sim\!1.001)$ . Two discrete sample s show a normal polarity and the presence of a low-coercivity phase (magnetite, titanomagnetite, o r maghemite) consistent with thermal remanent magnetization.  

# 5.1.3.4. Geochemistry  

Six IW samples were collected in Hole U1565B. Slight increases in dissolved Cl, Ca, Na, and Si ar e documented with depth, whereas $\mathrm{Mg}$ and Li decrease with depth. Little to no change is observe d for K or Sr. Increasing Ca and decreasing $\mathrm{Mg}$ could reflect the diagenetic alteration of volcaniclastic material or seawater-basalt interactions. Downcore increases in alkalinity, Mn, $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ , and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{\,3-}$ are paired with decreasing $\mathsf{p H}$ and may reflect microbially mediated oxidation of organic matter, although little change is observed for ${\mathrm{SO}}_{4}^{\ 2-}$ .  

Total carbon (TC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), calcium carbonate $\left(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\right)$ ), total organic carbo n (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and sulfur were determined on six discrete sediment samples. TI C content ranges from $1.25~\mathrm{wt\%}$ in the upper section of the cored sediments (0.09–2.91 mbsf) t o below $0.01\mathrm{~wt}\%$ (average $=\,0.69\,\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ). Assuming TIC is purely representative of $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ value s range $_{<0.1}$ to $10.4\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ . TC varies between 0.2 and $1.6\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ (average $=1.2\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ ). TOC is betwee n 0.17 and $0.63\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ (average $=0.33\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) with no clear trend downcore. TOC/TN ratios are betwee n 3 and 25 (average ${\it\Delta\phi}=9{\it\Delta\Psi}$ ), representative of primarily marine organic matter. In all samples, sulfur i s below detection limits.  

# 5.1.3.5. Physical properties  

Physical property data acquired at Site U1565 include density, MS, $P$ -wave velocity, natural gamm a radiation (NGR), color reflectance, X-ray imaging, thermal conductivity, and spectral imaging. Gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density of the sedimentary section varies from 1.4 to 1.7 9 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ . Moisture and density (MAD) measurements collected for each section yielded very simila r bulk densities (average $=1.69\ \mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ ; $n=\!11$ ), and measured grain densities vary from 2.63 to 2.7 9 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ (average $=2.72\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ . Porosities range $9\%{-}67\%$ , reflecting the sediment’s noncompacte d nature. MS measured on whole rounds and split sections are very similar and range $\sim\!34\times10^{-5}$ t o $90\times10^{-5}$ [SI]. A MS peak $(566\times10^{-5}$ [SI]) in Section 396-U1565A-1R-1 correlates to a dropston e found in the core.  

Thermal conductivity measured at $40\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ in Section 396-U1565A-2R-1 yielded an average of 1.4 2 W/(m·K). NGR for the sedimentary unit varies from 27.7 to 38.1 counts/s (average $=33$ counts/s). A MAD sample collected at $61\;\mathrm{cm}$ in Section 2R-1 yielded a bulk density of $1.78\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , grain density of $2.7\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and porosity of $55\%$ . $P_{-}$ -wave velocity measured at $60\,\mathrm{cm}$ in Section 2R-1 using th e Section Half Measurement Gantry (SHMG) resulted in $1530\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ in the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -direction and $1510\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ in the $z_{\cdot}$ -direction.  

Cores 396-U1565A-3R and 4R penetrated granitic basement (Lithostratigraphic Unit II). Th e average GRA bulk density of the hard rocks in these core sections is $2.56\,{\mathrm{cm}}^{3}$ after the liner correction is applied, which agrees with the three MAD samples collected from these cores. MAD measurements revealed relatively high porosities of $\mathord{\sim}10\%$ in the granite cubes. MS in the hard rocks i s significantly lower than that of the overlying sediments (0 to $22\times10^{-5}$ [SI]).  

# 5.2. Site U1566  

A complete section of the feather edge of an SDR sequence below a thin Quaternary sediment uni t was recovered at Site U1566. The basalt flows and interbasaltic sediment units were deposited in  a subaerial environment and overlie the same weathered granitic basement that was sampled at Sit e U1566.  

# 5.2.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1566 is a companion site to Site U1565. Both sites are located on the western flank of th e Kolga High (Figure F14) about $1\,\mathrm{km}$ apart at a water depth just above $2000\;\mathrm{m}$ . The Kolga High i s one of several areas along the rifted margin that are characterized by a thin sediment cover on th e top basalt surface and a rapidly westward-shoaling Base Cretaceous Unconformity (BCU) (Zastrozhnov et al., 2020).  

Interpretation of extensive 3-D seismic reflection data shows that the Kolga High is covered b y breakup-related basalts except for two small windows $\left(5\;\mathrm{km}\times3\;\mathrm{km}\right)$ sized) just west of the Kolg a High summit (Millett et al., 2022). Characteristic SDR lap onto the Kolga High along its wester n margin, thinning toward the basalt windows where the lavas have been eroded, making the Kolg a High one of the few sites along the Vøring and Møre Margins where the transition from the lowermost extrusive volcanic rocks to the subbasalt strata is accessible by drilling. A previous attempt t o determine the nature of this boundary was carried out during ODP Leg 104 in 1985 on the Vørin g Marginal High. Hole 642E showed that the SDR represent thick piles of subaerially emplace d basalt flows (Eldholm et al., 1989; Planke, 1994), but unfortunately did not get through the entir e lava pile. The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) drilled the eastern part of the Kolga Hig h in 2014 (Hole 6403/1-U-1) and recovered $38\,\textrm{m}$ of hyaloclastite with a tholeiitic compositio n (Bakke, 2017) in the upper part of a lava delta, as defined by eastward prograding reflections, bu t did not penetrate through the entire extrusive volcanic sequence.  

The primary objective of Site U1566 was to sample the lowermost part of the SDR on the Kolg a High and, if possible, drill through the entire basalt sequence, but this was not the primary targe t because the nearby Site U1565 targeted the subbasalt units. By drilling Site U1566, we first aime d to determine the emplacement environment of the initial volcanism on the Kolga High because i t provides important constraints on the vertical movement of the margin prior to the onset of extrusive volcanism and extension during the final rifting phase prior to breakup. A second objective a t Site U1566 was to constrain the timing of the onset of extrusive volcanism in this area and to provide further insights into the hypothesis that breakup and extrusive volcanism on the Møre Margin predated breakup along the Vøring Margin (e.g., Gernigon et al., 2003). A third objective o f Site U1566 was to characterize the magma source of the earliest extrusive basalts and determin e whether it was primordial, which would imply rapid ascent through the crust, or it evolved durin g storage at crustal levels with potential incorporation of continental crustal rocks. A fourth objective was to constrain the rates of magma production both from geochemical analyses and potentially by biostratigraphic dating of interlayered sediments. The final objective of Site U1566 was t o gather information on the extent of the basement lithologies drilled at Site U1565 and on lavasubsurface interaction if the bottom of the lava pile could be reached. Although Site U1566 wa s placed only $1\;\mathrm{km}$ away from Site U1565, the seismic data were inconclusive about the dip of th e basal surface of the lava pile and hence the depth to this interface.  

# 5.2.2. Operations  

Site U1566 consists of a single hole cored to 181.7 mbsf. Coring started at $0525~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 Augus t 2021 and ended at $2230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 August to accommodate the Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI) logging run in daylight hours on 20 August. A total of 33 cores were taken using the RCB syste m (Figure F4), recovering $100.5\mathrm{~m~}$ $(55\%)$ of core. Cores 396-U1566A-1R through 3R and 32R–33 R were taken with full-length advances. Cores 4R (26.2 mbsf) through 31R (162.3 mbsf) were take n with half-length advances to improve core recovery of the basaltic basement.  

All four logging tool strings, the triple combination (triple combo), VSI, Formation MicroScanne r (FMS)-sonic tool, and Ultrasonic Borehole Imager (UBI) tool strings, were run to 145 mbsf in th e hole. After the wireline logging concluded, the drill string was pulled back to the surface an d secured, ending Hole U1566A and Site U1566 at $0230~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 August. The time spent on Hol e U1566A was $124\,\mathrm{{h}}$ or 5.2 days.  

# 5.2.3. Principal results  

# 5.2.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The succession recovered at Site U1566 is divided into three lithostratigraphic units. Unit I (0– $19.05\,\mathrm{~m~}$ core depth below seafloor, Method A [CSF-A]) is unconsolidated clay with varyin g amounts of silt and sand as well as foraminifers. Some of the intervals contain clasts and nodules. Unit II $\mathrm{^{(26.20-148}\,m\,C S F-A)}$ is basalt and interbasaltic sediment divided into 14 igneous subunit s and 13 sedimentary subunits with a total cored thickness of $121.8\;\mathrm{m}$ . Each igneous subunit is composed of one to several discrete lava flows. The dominant facies is aphyric basalt with rare microphenocrysts  of  plagioclase  and  characteristically  variable  vesicularity  (Figure  F10).  Th e chemostratigraphy of the igneous subunits obtained using pXRF shows significant and abrup t variations of the magma composition downhole. Unit III $148{-}175.4\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ ) is weakly to moderately altered, medium-grained monzogranite with biotite, alternating with decomposed granit e and granite-derived sandstones (Figure F10).  

# 5.2.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

Sedimentary samples analyzed from the first three cores in Hole U1566A yield common to trac e diatoms and other biosiliceous debris, trace in situ dinoflagellate cysts, sporomorphs, rare ostracods, common to trace benthic foraminifers, and common planktonic foraminifers. Age diagnostic microfossils indicate an overall Quaternary age for the sedimentary deposits above th e uppermost igneous facies.  

In addition, a single sample taken from sediments interbedded between igneous rocks in Sectio n 396-U1566A-11R-1 yielded a diverse terrestrial pollen and spore assemblage and a few aquati c elements. Age diagnostic pollen encountered at this level suggest an earliest Eocene age for thi s sample.  

# 5.2.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Cores 396-U1566A-1R through 3R show normal polarity, followed by reversed polarity from Cor e 4R to the bottom of the hole, with some data points showing evidence of normal polarity. Lithostratigraphic Unit I has an average initial intensity of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) o f $4.3\times10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ . The average NRM of Units II and III is ${\sim}1.4\,\mathrm{A/m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , which is two orders of magnitud e higher than that of the sediments.  

Stepwise demagnetization was conducted on 32 discrete samples from Hole U1566A (therma l demagnetization) with a focus on unaltered basalt flow samples (30 samples). One sediment an d one alkali granite sample were also analyzed. The basalt sequence records mostly a reversed magnetic polarity.  

# 5.2.3.4. Geochemistry  

Three IW samples were collected from Hole U1566A, including one mudline sample. Alkalinit y increases from the mudline $(2.3\;\mathrm{mM})$ to the deepest IW sample taken at 18 mbsf $\left(3.1\:\mathrm{mM}\right)$ in Hol e U1566A. pH is 7.8 in the mudline and declines to 7.7 at the base of the sediments. $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ conten t ranges from $4.04~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at 2.95 mbsf to $2.16~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at 18 mbsf. $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ is below detection limit in th e mudline but increases to $56.6\;\mathrm{mM}$ in the deepest sample.  

The hard rock samples $\left(n\,=\,42\right)$ ) recovered from Hole U1566A (Lithostratigraphic Unit II) ar e mostly subalkaline basalt, with one picrite, and three samples from Unit III plot as granodiorit e and granite. Comparison of the data obtained from inductively coupled plasma–atomic emissio n spectrometry (ICP-AES) with pXRF analysis with basalts from the upper series in ODP Hole 642 E (Meyer et al., 2009) and flood basalts from East Greenland (Tegner et al., 1998) indicates an overlap of most samples from Site U1566 with the low-Ti basalts of Greenland (Figure F11). Anothe r two samples from Unit III show compositions of high-K granite (Rickwood, 1989), consistent wit h the high proportion of alkali feldspar, a typical signature of an A-type granitoid (Frost et al., 2001).  

TC, TIC, $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3},$ TOC, TN, and sulfur were determined on three discrete sediment samples. TI C content ranges $1.1\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ at 2.95 mbsf to $0.02~\mathrm{wt\%}$ at 18 mbsf. $C a C O_{3}$ ranges $0.2–11.3\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . TO C ranges $0.21{-}0.03~\mathrm{wt}\%$ . All TOC/TN ratios are below 5, indicating marine organic matter. H an d sulfur were below detection limits.  

# 5.2.3.5. Physical properties  

Physical properties were measured on all whole-round cores, archive and working-half sections, and discrete samples from Hole U1566A. Measurements included GRA bulk density, MS, NGR, $P$ - wave velocity, X-ray imaging, MAD and porosity $(n=102)$ ) analysis, and thermal conductivity $\left[n=\right.$ 30).  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I cores have $P$ -wave velocities of $1489{-}2909\ \mathrm{m/s}$ and whole-round GR A bulk density from 1.51 to $2.10\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Whole-round MS has a mean of $77.7\times10^{-5}$ [SI] compared t o a mean of $86.9\times10^{-5}$ [SI] from discrete half-round measurements. NGR for the sediments varie s from 19 to 44 counts/s. The bulk density of discrete samples ranges $1.54{-}1.82\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ $\left(n=6\right)$ , an d grain densities range $2.74{-}2.80\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

The ${\sim}121\mathrm{~m~}$ thick Unit II succession revealed dominantly very low gamma radiation counts $_{<10}$ counts/s) in the basalt subunits, whereas the intervolcanic sediment subunits show more variatio n and values as high as 62.8 counts/s. Discrete samples have bulk densities ranging $1.69{-}2.84\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Discrete measurements of $P$ -wave velocity range $1530{-}5884\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ and display systematic variation s associated with the varying lithologies. In total, 23 successful thermal conductivity measurement s were made across a range of lithologies in Unit II, ranging $1{-}1.9\,\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ . The MS in the sequenc e (mean $=482\times10^{-5}$ [SI]) is significantly higher than that of the overlying soft sediments (mean $=78$ $\times\,10^{-5}$ [SI]).  

The granitic basement in Unit III has higher gamma radiation readings $\mathrm{(mean}\,=\,53.5$ counts/s ) compared to the overlying volcanic sequence, and discrete bulk densities range $1.97{-}2.58~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . SHMG $P$ -wave velocity measurements range $1502{-}4501\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , and thermal conductivity measurements have a mean of $2.1\:\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\mathrm{{\cdotK}})$ .  

# 5.2.3.6. Downhole measurements  

Wireline data from the four log runs comprise sonic velocities, MS, NGR, bulk density, resistivit y measurements, and UBI and FMS image data of the basalt-sediment sequence of Lithostratigraphic Unit II. The lava package displays a consistently low background gamma radiation trend, with three clear peaks in the NGR log linked to siliciclastic sediment interlayers. The MS lo g reveals clear variations, with higher MS in the basalt flow subunits and almost zero MS in th e interbasaltic sediments. The porosity-dependent resistivity, bulk density, photoelectric effec t (PEF), and $P$ -wave and $S$ -wave velocity logs show systematic variations throughout basalt subunit s similar to logs collected in other subaerial basalt flow sequences in the province (e.g., Planke, 1994). For instance, the $P$ -wave velocity is as low as $2.5\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ in the interbasaltic sediment subunit s and flow tops and increases toward the massive basalt interiors, reaching almost $6~\mathrm{km/s}$ . Th e imaging logs (FMS-sonic and UBI) similarly display systematic variations in lava flow facies, wit h vesicular, low-resistivity flow tops and massive, resistive interiors with probable amygdules.  

# 5.3. Sites U1567 and U1568  

Sites U1567 and U1568 comprise a transect of five holes that sample the upper part of the Modgunn hydrothermal vent complex. The vent complex is truncated by an intra-Early Eocene erosional unconformity and is overlain by $20{-}50\mathrm{~m~}$ of Eocene to recent sediments. It consists of  a feeder system and a crater at the paleoseafloor. The crater was rapidly infilled during the PETM, presenting an expanded section that consists of diatom-bearing mudstones and ash layers.  

# 5.3.1. Background and objectives  

A key objective of Expedition 396 was to constrain the role of breakup volcanism in the PETM. I t has long been argued that LIPs may have dramatic impacts on the Earth's environment (e.g., Eldholm and Thomas, 1993; Svensen et al., 2019) and likely caused past mass extinctions (e.g., Erns t and Youbi, 2017). Explosive volcanism influences the climate by the eruption of large volumes o f aerosols and ash into the stratosphere, affecting the climate over short time periods of days t o years. Long-term climate effects of volcanism are mainly related to emission of sulfur dioxide tha t causes global cooling and greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide that cause global warming.  

Very large volumes of greenhouse gases must be emitted in short time periods to trigger globa l warming. One potential mechanism for the eruption of several thousands of gigatons of carbonbearing gases is the thermal maturation of sedimentary rocks by igneous intrusions offshore midNorway (Svensen et al., 2004). The key aspects of this hypothesis are that (1) magma injected as sil l intrusions into organic-rich sedimentary rocks generates large volumes of greenhouse gases, namely methane and carbon dioxide, in metamorphic aureoles and (2) pressure buildup due to ga s generation causes fracturing of the host rocks, forming hydrothermal vent complexes where th e gas and associated solids are transported from the deep sediment basins to the hydrosphere an d atmosphere.  

Although this process may release the amount of carbon required for the observed climate change, specifically between 2000 and $12000\,\mathrm{Gt}$ (Dickens et al., 1995; Dickens, 2011), it is not immediatel y clear if the bulk of the intrusions were emplaced over the geologically short time span that i s required to, for example, explain the observed global warming during the PETM. Also, it is unclea r whether the carbon would have been emitted as $C O_{2}$ or $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ .  

The hydrothermal systems associated with sill intrusions are manifested as pipe-like seismi c anomalies that typically root at the tips of saucer-shaped sill intrusions (Planke et al., 2005). Thes e so-called hydrothermal vent complexes are divided into a lower part (the pipe) and an upper par t characterized by crater, eye, or dome-shaped seismic features at the paleoseafloor. The pipes ar e hundreds of meters long, sometimes up to $6\,\mathrm{km}$ . The upper part is typically $1{-}2\;\mathrm{km}$ in diamete r but may vary in size from some hundreds of meters to $>\!5\,\mathrm{km}$ . Many of the crater-shaped depressions are infilled by stratified seismic units and topped by characteristic mounds above the paleoseafloor. More than 1000 of these hydrothermal vent complexes have been mapped in sedimentar y basins along the northeast Atlantic margins (Skogseid and Eldholm, 1989; Planke et al., 2005; Manton, 2015; Reynolds et al., 2017; Kjoberg et al., 2017; Omosanya et al., 2018; Roelofse et al., 2021).  

Information on the nature of the pipes exists from cuttings from a single well in the Vøring Basi n (6607/12-1; Svensen et al., 2003; Frieling et al., 2016) and from (much older) field analogs, such a s in the Karoo Basin in South Africa (Jamtveit et al., 2004; Svensen et al., 2006) and the Tungusk a Basin in Siberia (Svensen et al., 2009, 2018). The nature of the mound structures, however, i s largely unconstrained. Their interpretation ranges from mud volcano–like sediment deposition t o buildup of massive sulfide deposits that are formed at the hydrothermal vent sites by precipitatio n from hot vent fluids (Berndt et al., 2016).  

Sites U1567 and U1568 are located on the Modgunn Arch (Figure F14) some $50\,\mathrm{km}$ north of th e basalt flows sampled at the Kolga High on a dome structure that is interpreted to have formed i n the Miocene (Gernigon et al., 2021). The sites were selected because the regional doming uplifte d the vent sites to within reach of IODP drilling. Such shallow burial depths of vent complexes ar e currently only identified in the Modgunn Arch area in the Vøring Basin and in the Danmarkshav n Basin on the northeast Greenland shelf.  

The seismic data clearly show the presence of sill intrusions at shallow depth, ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{km}$ below seafloor, on the Modgunn Arch. The sills are located in a deformed sedimentary unit with wea k reflections that terminate against an angular unconformity (Figure F5). A hydrothermal vent complex is interpreted above the upper margin of the sill. The unconformity truncates the dippin g reflections in the upper part of the hydrothermal vent complex. At the center of the depression, immediately above the pipe structure, the reflections bend upward, forming a mound. Thi s mound is overlain by draped and onlapping reflections up toward the seafloor.  

The aim of Sites U1567 and U1568 was to sample the upper part of the Modgunn hydrotherma l vent complex and a nearby reference site along a $500~\mathrm{m}$ long transect to characterize the geolog y of the vent complex while avoiding the dome-shaped central part of the structure.  

The first drilling objective was to constrain the processes that form the seafloor depressions an d the infill. At least four potential scenarios are conceivable for this. First, pipe initiation may b e explosive due to interaction of sill intrusions with preexisting zones of overpressure that may lea d to hydrofracturing of the host rock and rapid ascent of expanding gas. This will result in blowout s that can create craters with similar dimensions as the observed eye structure within days (Thatj e et al., 1999; Leifer and Judd, 2015) and infill within a few hundred years. Second, they may b e caused by long-term seepage of gas and aqueous fluids liquefying the surface sediments, such a s the Lusi mud volcano in Indonesia (Mazzini et al., 2007). Third, they may be caused by repeate d mobilization of mud by sills intruding into unconsolidated sediments leading to mud volcanis m (e.g., Perez-Garcia et al., 2009) over a time span of thousands of years. Finally, they may result fro m venting of hydrothermal fluids and precipitation of pyrites and pyrotites over thousands of year s (Berndt et al., 2016). Although the first two processes would require a later mobilization of th e infill to form the observed domes at the upper termination, for example by gas-controlled seafloo r doming (Koch et al., 2015), the domes in the latter two scenarios would be explained by the ejection of vent material.  

Each of the four processes would be associated with very different types of material that wa s ejected during the time that the pipe was formed, both for the solid and the fluid phase. Therefore, understanding the formative processes for the eye structures is intrinsically linked to the secon d objective: to obtain information on the fluid and gas compositions (i.e., $\mathrm{CO_{2},\ C H_{4},}$ or highe r hydrocarbons) and concentrations and the amount of carbon released because this is crucial fo r understanding the potential role of hydrothermal venting as a driver of PETM climate change. This includes constraining the rates of fluid venting and its potential to reach far up into the wate r column or atmosphere depending on how violent the release was, if submarine venting occurred.  

The third objective was to characterize the emplacement environment and age of the hydrothermal vent complexes and how it changed in response to venting and rapid warming during th e PETM. This characterization includes the changes in microfossil assemblages before, during, an d after the PETM. We also set out to determine whether there is evidence for environmenta l changes in the immediate vicinity of the proposed source of greenhouse gases.  

The fourth objective of Sites U1567 and U1568 was to date the prominent unconformity at th e Modgunn Arch and the timing of uplift of the eye structure because this constrains the vertica l movement of the margin, which is crucial input for melt generation models.  

# 5.3.2. Operations  

Operations at Site U1567 revolved around three holes. The first hole reached 195.9 mbsf. Thre e coring systems were used (Figure F4). The APC system was used from the seafloor to 52.9 mbsf. The HLAPC system was deployed for a single core between 52.9 and 54.1 mbsf. After reachin g piston coring refusal, the XCB system was deployed for the remainder of the hole. Half-lengt h advances of the XCB system were employed to 69.4 mbsf, and the remainder of the hole was core d using full-length advances. After coring operations ended in Hole U1567A, the hole was prepare d for wireline logging and then successfully logged with the triple combo and FMS-sonic too l strings.  

Hole U1567B was offset ${\sim}165\;\mathrm{m}$ west of Hole U1567A in the direction of Site U1568. It was drille d without recovery to 25 mbsf and then cored with the APC system to 49.3 mbsf, where we experienced a partial stroke of the APC system on Core 396-U1567B-4H. We then switched to the XC B system and continued coring with half-length advances to maximize core recovery. Hole U1567 B was terminated at 83 mbsf after retrieving Core 11X. After coring concluded, the drill string wa s pulled back above the seafloor and secured for transit under dynamic positioning (DP) mode t o Site U1568. The bit cleared the seafloor at $1850\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 August 2021, ending Hole U1567B.  

The $0.25\ \mathrm{nmi}$ move to Site U1568 was completed at $1936\,\mathrm{h}$ . With the thrusters already down, th e move from Site U1567 to Site U1568 consumed only $45~\mathrm{min}$ of vessel operations. Operations a t Site U1568 consisted of two holes. Hole U1568A reached 200.0 mbsf. Two coring systems wer e used in the coring operations (Figure F4). The APC system was used from the seafloor to 51. 7 mbsf. The final two cores, 6H and 7H, were both incomplete strokes, and Core 7H advanced onl y $0.3\;\mathrm{m}$ into the formation. The XCB system was employed to advance the hole to the final depth o f 200 mbsf. The hole was then prepared for logging, and we successfully conducted two passes eac h with the triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings. With operations in Hole U1568A complete, th e vessel was offset along the seismic line by approximately $165\;\mathrm{m}$ in the direction of Site U1567.  

Hole U1568B was washed down to 30 mbsf. The APC system was deployed and advanced to 49. 0 mbsf, where we experienced a partial stroke of the APC system on Core 3H. The XCB system wa s deployed, and coring continued with half-length advances to maximize core recovery to 114. 8 mbsf. Hole U1568B was terminated at 124.6 mbsf after retrieving Core 17X with a full-lengt h advance. After coring concluded, the drill string was pulled back above the seafloor and secure d for the DP transit back to Site U1567, thus ending Hole U1568B at $1900~\mathrm{h}$ on 26 August. Afte r completing operations at Site U1568 and with the APC/XCB drill string still deployed, the vesse l moved in DP mode to reoccupy Site U1567. A total of $71.50\,\mathrm{h}$ or 3.0 days elapsed while conductin g operations at Site U1568.  

A total of 43 cores were recovered at Site U1568 (Figure F4). The APC system was deployed nin e times over a $70.7~\mathrm{m}$ interval and recovered $72.03\textrm{m}$ of core $(102\%)$ . A total of $34\,\mathrm{XCB}$ cores wer e recovered over a $223.9\;\mathrm{m}$ interval. The XCB system recovered $75\%$ of the interval cored or 167.3 4 m of core. The total interval cored at Site U1568 was $294.6~\mathrm{m}$ ; 239.37 m of core was recovered fo r an overall coring efficiency of $81\%$ .  

After completing coring operations at Site U1568, we set the end of the pipe at 1666 meters belo w rig floor (mbrf) and returned to Site U1567 in DP mode to core an additional hole between Hole s U1567A and U1567B with the objective of improving the sampling across the Paleocene/Eocen e boundary at this site. Once over the new hole coordinates, we spudded Hole U1567C at $2040\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 26 August. The precision depth recorder seafloor depth was 1706.1 mbsl. We drilled to 30 mbs f without recovery and then APC/XCB cored to 106.0 mbsf (Cores 1H–14X). Coring operation s were completed at $0820~\mathrm{h}$ on 27 August, and the drill string was recovered back on board an d secured for the sea passage to Site U1569. A total of $72.25\,\mathrm{h}$ or 3.0 days passed while conductin g operations at Site U1567. A total of 46 cores were taken at this site. The total interval cored at Sit e U1567 was $329.9\;\mathrm{m}$ with $303.35\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered $(92\%)$ .  

# 5.3.3. Principal results  

# 5.3.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Sites U1567 and U1568 consist of five holes spread along a $500~\mathrm{m}$ transect of infilled sediment s associated with cratering in the Modgunn hydrothermal vent complex. The succession recovere d at the two sites is divided into six lithostratigraphic units, all of which are identified in each of th e five holes and are preliminarily tied based on unit boundaries. Generally, core recovery was high i n all the holes, and the depths of most lithostratigraphic unit boundaries are well established. Unit  I is gray clay with trace to rare dropstones. Unit II consists of dark brownish gray sediment (clay- t o pebble-sized nodules) rich in manganese and iron in the uppermost interval and light yellowis h brown sand-rich clay throughout. Unit III is pale yellow to very dark greenish gray clay with silt, including clasts of clay and rare beds of siltstone. Unit IV is dark greenish gray to very dark gra y claystone to siltstone with common volcanic ash beds. Unit V is very dark gray to black paralle l laminated claystone with common volcanic ash and lacking bioturbation. Unit VI is very dar k greenish gray clay- to siltstone with moderate bioturbation.  

# 5.3.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

A thin layer of Quaternary sediments (Lithostratigraphic Unit I) present in all holes in roughl y equal thickness $\langle{\sim}35\;\mathrm{m}\rangle$ was assigned a Quaternary age based on planktonic foraminifer content. No Neogene sediments were identified. Below this, middle Early Eocene (Zone E3) sediment s were sampled in Holes U1567A, U1567B, and U1568A. Biostratigraphic and palynological analyses indicated earliest Eocene sediments (Zone E1) were recorded in Hole U1568A, but their presence was not confirmed by biostratigraphic analyses in Holes U1568B and U1567A–U1567C. Th e PETM succession below is identified based on the presence of the dinocyst marker species Apectodinium augustum (Subzone P6b) and supported by diatom marker taxa (Figure F9). Th e extremely expanded PETM deposits sit below the middle Early or earliest Eocene sediments an d span between ${\sim}20\mathrm{~m~}$ in Hole U1567A and a virtually unprecedented $70{-}80\ \mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1568A, given the combined biostratigraphic and lithostratigraphic constraints.  

Hole U1567B, and perhaps Hole U1568B, may contain a latest Paleocene sequence (Subzone P6a), but this is not seen in any of the other holes, where the PETM succession rests unconformably o n lower Upper to Middle Paleocene sedimentary successions.  

# 5.3.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

The sediments at Sites U1567 and U1568 show low magnetic intensity (less than ${\sim}10^{-3}\;\mathrm{A/m})$ i n ${\sim}40\%$ of the recovered sections. In some intervals, both the magnetic intensity and the magneti c inclination angle vary greatly (Figure F13). The consistent distribution of these intervals wit h depth and across holes suggests that the low intensity is determined by the detrital source rathe r than representing a drilling artifact. In such intervals, magnetic polarity cannot be reliably determined. The magnetic inclination data after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization is typically used to determine magnetic polarity and to place the core sections in a magnetostratigraphic age framework. On the other hand, there are also intervals with moderate to high magnetic intensity (greater tha n ${\sim}10^{-3}\,\mathrm{A/m})$ . These present both magnetic reversals and magnetic excursions, particularly in Hole s U1567A (Core 4H), U1567B (Core 2H), and U1568A (Sections 4H-3 through 5H-3). These reversals, having similar inclination angles in normal and reversed polarity, pass the polarity test an d therefore are interpreted as recording the geomagnetic field. The uppermost cores of each hol e show a dominantly normal polarity and an inclination close to the calculated geomagnetic dipol e field inclination $(\sim\!77^{\circ})$ for these latitudes. These characteristics suggest that the paleomagneti c data of the youngest sediments accurately capture the geomagnetic field and its periodic reversals.  

# 5.3.3.4. Geochemistry  

Almost 100 fluid and sediment samples were collected from the five holes along the transec t between Holes U1567A and U1568A. For Hole U1568A, the site closest to the center of the Modgunn vent complex, several elemental profiles of IW diverge from the conservative behavio r observed in most of the other holes. The first evidence for this can be seen in the transitio n between Lithostratigraphic Units I and II (36 mbsf), where some elements decrease significantl y across the boundary. These include K (from 12 to $11\,\mathrm{mM}_{\sun}$ ) and $\mathrm{Mg}$ (from ${>}50$ to ${<}45\,\mathrm{mM}$ ). Some o f the analyzed elements increase in concentration across this boundary, with the clearest rise s observable in the profiles of Ca (from ${>}12$ to $13.5\;\mathrm{mM}]$ ), Sr (from 80 to $110\;\mathrm{mM}_{}$ ), and Li (from 3 0 to $40\;\mathrm{mM},$ ). These shifts suggest a complex diagenetic environment, with evidence of marine silicate weathering (e.g., increasing Na and K) but also ash alteration (e.g., rising Ca and decreasin g Mg). The elemental data for Unit IV in Hole U1568A corroborate the anomalous values of alkalinity and $\mathsf{p H}$ in these strata. Contents of B, Ca, Mg, Si, Sr, and Li are all diminished with respect t o overlying and underlying sediments. Mn, Fe, and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ covary in Hole U1568A, displaying clea r enrichments in the uppermost section of the hole and much lower values below 50 mbsf. Increased concentrations of these constituents in the upper sections lend support for microbiall y mediated oxidation of organic matter.  

# 5.3.3.5. Physical properties  

Physical properties were measured for all cores at Sites U1567 and U1568. Lithostratigraphic Uni t I consists of up to $35\;\mathrm{m}$ thick Quaternary glacial and interglacial deposits with a mean bulk densit y of $1.81\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and porosities between $47\%$ and $67\%$ . The unit shows a relatively high gamma radioactivity with an across-borehole median of 40 counts/s. $P$ -wave velocities measured using th e Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) range $1480{-}2978\ \mathrm{m/s}$ (median $=1572\ \mathrm{m/s})$ ), an d SHMG $P$ -wave point measurements never exceed $1702\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , attesting to the soft and poorly compacted nature of the sediments. Unit II is generally less than $2\,\mathrm{m}$ thick and consists of Quaternar y clay characterized by a rapid decrease in velocity and density with respect to Unit I. Unit III i s characterized by a gradual increase in density $\left(\mathrm{mean}=1.71\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}\right)$ with a corresponding increas e in MS that increases most substantially toward the base of the unit, reaching maximum values i n all five holes. The peak MS transition associated with the Unit III/IV boundary generally decrease s laterally from Hole U1568A (maximum $=\,1772\,\times\,10^{-5}$ [SI]; mean $=\,451.3\,\times\,10^{-5}$ [SI]) to Hol e U1567A (maximum $=740.5\times10^{-5}$ [SI]; mean $=225.3\times10^{-5}$ [SI]). The highest MS above this horizon $(>\!1700\times10^{-5}$ [SI], as measured by the Section Half Multisensor Logger [SHMSL]) occur in th e two holes most proximal to the center of the vent complex (U1568A and U1568B). We suggest tha t the basal high MS layer (with values greater than $1700\times10^{-5}$ [SI]) in the two proximal borehole s may pinch out prior to reaching the three more distal Site U1567 boreholes, where values ${\sim}700-$ $800\times10^{-5}$ [SI] are recorded.  

The recovered thickness of Unit IV varies from $\mathord{\sim}6\;\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1567A to more than $65\;\mathrm{m}$ in Hol e U1568A. The recorded $P_{-}$ -wave velocity $\mathrm{(mean\,=\,1922~m/s;}$ ; median $=1903\ \mathrm{m/s}$ ) is the highes t amongst all units, associated with a relatively high mean bulk density of $1.74\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and a relativel y low MS of $90\times10^{-5}$ [SI]. The general trend of decreasing MS with depth appears to be linked to  a reduction of ash layers with depth in Unit IV. Units V and VI reveal generally low and consistent $P$ - wave velocities of around $1600\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ with accompanying low bulk densities with means of 1.43 an d $1.42~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively. In summary, the cored sequences revealed physical properties that ar e consistent with a very weakly compacted mudstone-dominated sequence with fine-scale interna l physical property variations linked to ash deposition.  

# 5.3.3.6. Downhole measurements  

Logging data were collected over a total open hole interval of ${\sim}112\,\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1567A and ${\sim}105\;\mathrm{m}$ in U1568A, yielding high-quality data from both the modified triple combo and FMS-sonic too l strings. Four logging units for Hole U1567A and three for Hole U1568A were defined, and the y broadly correspond to the lithostratigraphic units. Velocities and densities are low with few exceptions in the reference hole (U1567A) around $1.55\;\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ and $1.45~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively. However,  a well-defined NGR peak of $65~\mathrm{gAPI}$ is clearly visible. The proximal vent hole (U1568A) shows  a wider variation in seismic and NGR properties, with a velocity range of $1.5{-}2.7\ \mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , densitie s from 1.55 to $1.9\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and NGR from 30 to 40 gAPI. FMS image log data from both holes displa y fine-scale sedimentary structures and stratification.  

# 5.4. Sites U1569 and U1570  

Sites U1569 and U1570 were drilled as a transect of five holes on the Mimir High, which is part o f the Vøring Transform Margin. We recovered an expanded section of Paleocene and Eocene sediments, including a thick interval of PETM deposits, in three holes. The cores will allow us to constrain the climatic and environmental changes at high resolution and provide constraints on th e biogeochemical changes influenced by hydrothermal venting. The expanded sedimentary section s show that the Vøring Transform Margin was a depocenter during Paleocene rifting and into th e Early Eocene until the marginal high formed during passage of the Aegir Ridge some 5 My afte r breakup.  

# 5.4.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1569 and the ribbon of four boreholes that comprise Site U1570 are located on the Mimi r High at a $2171{-}2270\ \mathrm{m}$ water depth. The Mimir High is a transform margin high on the Vørin g Transform Margin (Figure F14). Such highs are characteristic structural elements of transfor m margins worldwide, such as offshore Ghana/Côte d’Ivoire, western Australia, and the Falkland s (Basile and Allemand, 2002; Mercier de Lépinay et al., 2016; Baby et al., 2018; Lorenzo and Wessel,  

1997). Transform margins are characterized by very narrow COBs and late uplift of the continental crust when the adjacent spreading center passes. Several processes are involved in the formation of the highs. They include lateral heat transport and associated thermal uplift as well a s erosion-enhanced uplift (Vågnes, 1997; Basile and Allemand, 2002).  

The Vøring Transform Margin is characterized by diminished breakup-related extrusive volcanism compared to the juxtaposed rifted margin segments of the Vøring and Møre Margins (Bernd t et al., 2001a). Nevertheless, thin extrusive basalts, intrusions, and a high-velocity, lower crusta l body have been documented for the Vøring Transform Margin (Gernigon et al., 2021; Mjelde et al., 2009). The reduced magmatic crustal thickening may be the result of cooling of the Norway Basi n lithosphere by the continental Vøring Plateau lithosphere during initial seafloor spreading, lowering the ambient mantle temperature and resulting in reduced melt generation (Berndt et al., 2001b). As a result, the basalt cover on the Vøring Transform Margin is generally thin, and eve n absent, on the Mimir High (Figure F14). However, an erosional truncation at the top of the hig h does not preclude that some basalt may have been eroded.  

The absence of basalt cover makes the Mimir High an exceptional place to study the stratigraph y at intervals coeval to and below the Paleogene basalt. These formations are not well known fro m drilling; the closest boreholes, 6504/5-15 and 6603/5-16, are more than $100\,\mathrm{km}$ away. However, th e strata are subcropping along a kilometer-high escarpment on the southwest flank of the Mimi r High. This escarpment was sampled during two cruises conducted in 2000 and 2013 using gravit y corers, dredges, and an ROV (Polteau et al., 2020). The cruises documented the presence of Uppe r Cretaceous to Lower Eocene successions that include outcropping doleritic sills with columna r jointing. Although the recovered late Campanian and early Maastrichtian sediments were deposited in a coastal to shallow marine setting, the Paleocene samples indicate deep marine condition s with abrupt shoaling and formation of the Mimir High in the Early Eocene. Toward the Vørin g Basin, seismic data clearly show several large sill intrusions that affected this part of the margi n and indicate that the strata generally dips from the Mimir High to the northeast (Figure F6).  

The first objective of Sites U1569 and U1570 was to constrain the paleoenvironmental condition s during the Paleocene–Eocene transition. In particular, we hoped to obtain high-resolution information about the timing, duration, and nature of the environmental changes due to rapid warmin g and subsequent cooling during the earliest Eocene. The second objective of Sites U1569 an d U1570 was to tie the borehole stratigraphy with reflection seismic data to constrain the vertica l movements of this margin segment as an input for geodynamic melt production models. In particular, the timing of uplift and any further constraints on the amount of crustal stretching ar e important. The third objective of Sites U1569 and U1570 was to characterize the Paleogene sediments and their potential for releasing hydrocarbons when intruded by sills. Here, the key parameter is the amount of TOC in the sediments that may be transformed to greenhouse gases b y contact metamorphism.  

In the case that any igneous rocks were sampled, a further objective was to constrain the meltin g and emplacement conditions. This includes the composition of the magma and in particular th e temperatures at which melting took place.  

# 5.4.2. Operations  

The original plan for Site U1569 called for dual coring of key stratigraphic intervals, including  a hole to 300 mbsf to be cored using the APC/XCB system and a second hole to 800 mbsf to be core d using the RCB system (Figure F4). In the case we could not properly sample the complete stratigraphic target at Site U1569, four offset holes of $200\textrm{m}$ each were proposed along a transect o f outcropping strata extending west of Site U1569, where deep stratigraphic targets were present a t shallower subseafloor depths, as an alternative drilling strategy.  

Hole U1569A was cored to the shortened depth of 404.6 mbsf after coring through the PETM, ou r scientific target, and penetrating $50~\mathrm{m}$ into the Upper Paleocene. Estimating that the base of th e Paleocene could be much deeper and to improve core recovery of the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, we ended coring in Hole U1569A in favor of sampling the older strata at much shallowe r depths at alternate ribbon Site U1570. Coring the PETM strata at a shallower location also allowe d us to sample less mature PETM sediments with better microfossil preservation.  

After coring ended in Hole U1569A, we conditioned the hole and released the RCB bit at the bottom of Hole U1569A in preparation for wireline logging. A total of $44~\mathrm{RCB}$ cores were retrieve d from the site, five of which were half-length advances. The RCB system was used to core $404.6~\mathrm{m},$ and $144.91\;\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered $(36\%)$ . The hole was then displaced with 125 bbl of $10.5\,\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{gal}$ mud, and the end of the pipe was set at 84.0 mbsf. The triple combo tool string was rigged up an d deployed. The initial logging run failed to pass a bridge at 127.4 mbsf. With very little open hole t o log, the tools were pulled back to the surface and logging operations were terminated. After logging concluded, the drill string was pulled back to the surface. The remaining top half of th e mechanical bit release (MBR) cleared the rotary table at $2220\ \mathrm{h},$ ending Hole U1569A and Sit e U1569. A total of $74.25\,\mathrm{h}$ or 3.1 days were recorded while on Site U1569.  

The coring plan at Site U1570 was the same for all four holes (Figure F4): to core to 200 mbsf an d sample the Paleocene/Eocene boundary interval at considerably shallower depths than at Sit e U1569. Three of the four holes were completed to $200\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , and the fourth one was terminated a t 163.6 mbsf after we determined that the science objective for the hole had been met. All four hole s were cored with the RCB system with a combination of half-length $(4.6\;\mathrm{m})$ and full-length $(9.6\;\mathrm{m})$ advances. The half-length advances were used to maximize core recovery in zones of interest a t the expense of the additional wireline time. Coring in the final hole, U1570D, was ended afte r reaching the Environmental Protection and Safety Panel approved depth of 200 mbsf. After conditioning Hole U1570D for wireline logging, the RCB bit was released at the bottom of the hole an d the end of pipe was set at $76.0\ \mathrm{mbsf}.$ . The triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings were successfully deployed to the full depth of the hole. After logging concluded, the drill string was pulle d back to the surface. The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) was racked back in the derrick, and th e outer core barrel was disassembled and inspected. The rig floor was secured at $2348\mathrm{~h~}$ , and th e bridge was notified that operations were complete at Site U1570. A total of $112\;\mathrm{RCB}$ cores wer e taken at the site. The RCB system was used to core $763.6~\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , and $270.09\;\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovere d $(35.4\%)$ . A total of $147.50\,\mathrm{h}$ or 6.2 days were recorded while on Site U1570.

# 5.4.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Sites U1569 and U1570 consist of five holes on the northeastern flank of the Mimir High. Th e holes sampled northeast dipping stratigraphy along a $5\,\mathrm{km}$ transect where Paleogene age seismi c reflections truncate below thin Quaternary sediments at ribbon Site U1570. The succession recovered at the two sites is divided into ten lithostratigraphic units. As expected from the seismic interpretation of the high-resolution 3-D seismic data, none of the five holes include all ten units. Uni t boundaries are identified based on lithologic change and supported by physical properties an d biostratigraphy. Where recovery is high, boundaries between units are well established. Wher e core recovery is low, unit boundaries are placed at the top of the underlying unit.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I is grayish brown and brown unconsolidated mud. Unit II consists of dar k greenish gray consolidated mud that is locally slightly bioturbated. Unit III is grayish brown san d rich clay with nodules. Unit IV is very dark gray mudstone. Unit V is divided into two subunits. Subunit Va is very dark gray mudstone with sparse parallel lamination and slight localized bioturbation along with rare limestone intervals and common ash beds. Subunit Vb is very dark gra y mudstone with sparse parallel lamination and slight localized bioturbation along with commo n ash beds and diagenetic pyrite. Unit VI is hypohyaline garnet dacite with cordierite, pyrite, an d graphite. Unit VII is dark gray ash-rich mudstone with parallel lamination and common pyrite. Unit VIII is dark greenish gray to dark gray bioturbated mudstone. Unit IX is light gray limestone. Unit X is very dark greenish gray bioturbated mudstone with common ash along with some bed s of limestone and volcaniclastic conglomerate.  

# 5.4.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

Quaternary sediments from Holes U1569A and U1570A–U1570D ${\sqrt{\sqrt{\frac{}{}-10-80\mathrm{~m~}}}}$ thick) are characterized by glacially influenced hemipelagic mud, which unconformably overlies Lower to Middl e Miocene strata followed by uppermost Oligocene strata that unconformably overlies upper Lowe r  

Eocene strata. Another stratigraphic break separates the upper Lower Eocene strata from the thic k $(>\!100\,\mathrm{m})$ lower Lower Eocene deposits, and much of the Lower Eocene is apparently missing. Th e lower Lower Eocene deposits include a PETM succession that is at least $10{-}40\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick. Th e sequences spanning the Paleocene/Eocene boundary do not show any record of the presence o f uppermost Paleocene sediments. Dinocyst chronobiostratigraphy suggests that at least $^{\sim1}$ My o f the latest Paleocene is missing. The oldest sediments recovered are assigned to the Middle Paleocene (Selandian; $61.6{-}59.2\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ), recorded in samples from Holes U1569A and U1570C.  

# 5.4.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

For the post-PETM strata (Lithostratigraphic Units I–VI), the average intensity of magnetizatio n varies from $2.26\times10^{-2}$ to $3.22\times10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ . The median coercivity varies from 1.06 to 2.17, indicating the magnetic mineralogy is dominated by diagenetic hematite or goethite. There are six conspicuous episodes of magnetic reversals marked by magnetic inclinations ${<}0^{\circ}$ (Figure F13). Th e bulk MS of one discrete sample (396-U1569A-23R, $28{-}30~\mathrm{cm})$ ) is over $1\times10^{-3}$ [SI], indicating  a small ferromagnetic contribution, possibly from magnetite. This is also the only discrete sampl e presenting subhorizontal magnetic fabrics. The rest of the samples are paramagnetic, with a bul k MS below $1\times10^{-3}$ [SI], and have oblique magnetic fabrics, which may be owed to drilling-relate d disturbances. A low corrected degree of anisotropy $(P^{\prime}<1.028)$ indicates the absence of micaceou s minerals.  

The average intensity of magnetization of PETM strata (Unit VIII) is lower than the post-PET M strata $\langle0.06\times10^{-2}$ to $0.13\times10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A/m})$ . However, the median coercivity is higher (1.32–3.04), indicating higher hematite or goethite proportions. At least two short-lived episodes of normal polarity truncated the dominantly reversed magnetic polarity. All four discrete samples present obliqu e magnetic fabrics, low bulk MS $\mathrm{{[\kappam\leq0.4\times10^{-3}}}$ [SI]) and low corrected degree of anisotropy $\left(P^{\prime}\leq$ 1.018). Pre-PETM strata (Units VIII–X) have the highest coercivity compared to the post-PET M and PETM units. High coercivity may be due to higher proportions of hematite and goethite. Their intensity of magnetization $\langle0.06\times10^{-2}$ to $0.59\times10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A/m})$ is lower than post-PETM strat a but similar to PETM strata. All discrete samples have low bulk MS $^{\prime}\kappa\leq0.5\times10^{-3}$ [SI]) and a lo w corrected degree of magnetic anisotropy $(P^{\prime}\,\leq\,1.077)$ ). Only two discrete samples (396-U1570B21R, $56{-}58\,\mathrm{cm}$ , and 25R $,92{-}94\,\mathrm{cm})$ ) present subhorizontal magnetic fabrics. The rest have obliqu e fabrics, possibly due to drilling-related disturbances.  

# 5.4.3.4. Geochemistry  

A total of 32 IW samples were collected from Hole U1569A, and 57 samples were collected fro m three holes at Site U1570. Geochemical data from these sites show substantial variability bot h downcore and between holes. In Hole U1569A, nonconservative behavior is observed for a rang e of measured IW variables, with periods of high pH and low alkalinity similar to those observed a t Sites U1567 and U1568. This is also similar to the profiles observed in Hole U1570C and suggest s that lithologic changes control the IW composition. In Holes U1570A and U1570B, however, elemental distributions appear to be primarily conservative, and they suggest diffusion and advectio n are the primary controls on IW composition, potentially linked to the extensive fracturing of thes e rocks. In all holes, carbonate content is high in the upper units before dropping to lower value s farther downcore. Occasional peaks in carbonate and organic carbon content suggest infrequen t authigenic mineral precipitation. Three hard rock samples from Lithostratigraphic Unit IV in Hol e U1570D appear to be of dacitic composition. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicates the primary sedimentary components are quartz, calcite, and a range of clays. In some samples, it wa s possible to identify clinoptilite as the primary clay mineral, a form of zeolite linked to ash weathering. The direct impact of volcanic ash deposition is present in the form of a range of pyroxen e minerals.  

# 5.4.3.5. Physical properties  

A total of 151 samples across the five holes were measured for MAD, and 1344 $P$ -wave velocit y measurements were made on discrete samples to constrain and supplement physical propert y measurements conducted on the WRMSL and SHMSL. The results showed distinct petrophysica l properties for the 10 lithostratigraphic units described at the sites. Similarly to Sites U1567 an d U1568, peaks in MS are related to the presence of ash beds, such as in Lithostratigraphic Subuni t Va. However, the magnetic signature of ash beds dissipates in Subunit Vb, and this characteristic i s interpreted as evidence of increased alteration of the ashes. The dacitic Unit VI (Holes U1570 A and U1570D) has noticeably higher seismic velocity, relatively high density, and low MS compare d to surrounding sediments. However, the highest $P$ -wave velocity of all five holes is recorded i n Unit IX $(\mathrm{mean}=4172.6\:\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ ), which represents the thin limestone bed found in Hole U1570B. Thi s unit also has high density (GRA bulk density mean $=2.31\ \mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ and the lowest porosity (MA D porosity $=19\%$ ) values.  

# 5.4.3.6. Downhole measurements  

Wireline logging was conducted in Holes U1569A and U1570D, which extended to 404.6 and 20 0 m drilling depth below seafloor (DSF), respectively. Two wireline logging tool strings, the tripl e combo and the FMS-sonic, were planned for Hole U1569A; however, an obstruction encountere d at $127.4\textrm{m}$ wireline log depth below seafloor (WSF) during the first deployment of the tripl e combo prevented us from completing the logging plan. Two logging runs were performed successfully in Hole U1570D with the triple combo and the FMS-sonic tool strings over a total open hol e logged interval of ${\sim}117\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Six logging units were defined in Hole U1570D, constrained by a combination of the lithostratigraphy, physical properties, and wireline data. In the main open hole logged interval of Hol e U1570D, the wireline properties reveal several transitions that correspond closely to the lithostratigraphic units.  

The open hole part of Logging Unit 2 reveals gamma radiation of ${\sim}45{-}50\ \mathrm{gAPI}$ , low bulk densit y of ${\sim}1.6{-}1.7\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and low consistent $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ of around ${\sim}1.65\;\mathrm{km/s}$ . Logging Unit 3 exhibits relativel y high $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ $({\sim}1.8\mathrm{-}2.3\ \mathrm{km/s})$ and resistivity compared to its surrounding claystone-dominate d sequence and corresponds closely to Lithostratigraphic Unit VI. Logging Unit 4 is characterized b y relatively high gamma radiation that fluctuates between ${\sim}45$ and 85 gAPI. Logging Unit 5 comprises a thin ${\sim}3\textrm{m}$ thick interval with elevated density $({\sim}1.95\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ and $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ $\left(2\,\mathrm{km}/\mathbf{s}\right)$ and extrem e PEF enrichment up to ${\sim}33\,\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{e}^{-}$ coupled with a gamma radiation reduction. The remainder of th e logged section is assigned to Logging Unit 6 and shows minor fluctuations in gamma radiation, density, and PEF.  

# 5.5. Sites U1571 and U1572  

Sites U1571 and U1572 sampled the upper portions of the Inner SDR on the central part of th e Vøring Margin. At both sites, two holes were drilled, the first using the RCB system to sample th e basaltic basement and the second one using the APC system to sample the overlying sedimen t package. The reason for drilling two sites only $5\,\mathrm{km}$ apart was the starkly different seismic characters of the top basalt surfaces at each site, which are interpreted to be the boundary between different emplacement environments where the upper sequence was emplaced into a we t environment (Planke et al., 2017). The sediments directly overlying igneous facies are of lates t Early Eocene age, which could be consistent with relatively late emplacement of the last floo d basalts on the Vøring Marginal High; however, it is equally possible that the overlying sediment s were not deposited immediately after the lava flows.  

# 5.5.1. Background and objectives  

Sites U1571 and U1572 are located on the Skoll High on the Vøring Marginal High, about $15\,\mathrm{km}$ west of the Vøring Escarpment (Figure F15). The western part of the Vøring Marginal High i s characterized by SDR sequences, first noted by Hinz and Weber (1976), that are interpreted as ${\le}6$ km thick volcanic complexes near the COB (Skogseid and Eldholm, 1987, 1989). The first sampling of basalts on the Vøring Marginal High was DSDP Leg 38 (Talwani, Udintsev, et al., 1976). Holes 338 and 342 were drilled into igneous basement, and 11 and $12\;\mathrm{m}$ of basalt were recovered, respectively. Subsequently, a 1277 m deep borehole was drilled into the upper margin of the SD R during ODP Leg 104 (Eldholm et al., 1987). Hole 642E yielded more than $900\mathrm{~m~}$ of basalt an d penetrated at least 135 lava flows and 3 dikes. The flows were interlayered with 59 volcaniclasti c sedimentary units that mainly represent weathered basalt flow tops and one ignimbrite. Based o n their geochemical and petrological composition, the volcanic succession was divided into a n upper $800\mathrm{~m~}$ thick tholeiite series and a lower series that is at least $100\mathrm{~m~}$ thick and consists o f dominantly basaltic andesite flows (Eldholm et al., 1987; Abdelmalak et al., 2016).  

The extent and thickness of the breakup-related basaltic complex has subsequently been mappe d along the mid-Norwegian continental margin using seismic volcanostratigraphy and igneou s seismic geomorphology (Berndt et al., 2001b; Planke et al., 2000, 2017; Millett et al., 2022). Th e seismic reflection data reveal substantial differences in the volcanic emplacement environment s across the Vøring Marginal High in time and space. Planke et al. (2017) documented distinc t differences in the physical volcanology across the marginal high based on the igneous seismi c geomorphology of the top basalt surface. The eastern parts of the margin are characterized by  a lava flow field that suggests that lava was flowing from eruption centers in the west toward th e paleocoastline in the east where they form a lava delta (Abdelmalak et al., 2016b). Incised valley s on the top basalt surface further suggest erosion by rivers flowing from west to east. The top basal t surface farther west is characterized by a rough morphology with numerous semicircular anomalies that have been interpreted as rootless cones due to lava flowing across a wet substrate leadin g to phreatomagmatic and phreatic eruptions. This pitted surface belongs to a seismic sequence tha t onlaps onto the eastern flow field and must be younger than the subaerial basalts drilled in Hol e 642E (Figure F7A). Strikingly, the two domains also exhibit very different structural deformation. There are few normal faults with minimal displacement of the pitted surface; in contrast, th e eastern subaerial lava flows are offset by numerous north–south trending normal faults wit h displacements of tens of meters.  

Site U1571 is located on the eastern faulted lava flow field, whereas Site U1572 is located on th e pitted surface farther west. The morphological difference between the two sites and the onla p relationship suggest that the lavas have been emplaced diachronously, possibly in different environments. The first objective of these sites was to obtain information on the emplacemen t environment based on the facies of the recovered basalt and sediments. This information will constrain the vertical movements of the margin, such as whether both facies were indeed emplaced i n a subaerial environment or whether there is a difference between the relatively well-constraine d subaerial flows in the east and the possibly shallow marine flows in the west. The second objectiv e was to establish the time of emplacement of the two sequences to constrain the temporal evolutio n of the breakup volcanism. The third objective was closely linked to the first two; by analyzing th e emplacement environment, we hoped to obtain information on the environmental and, by proxy, the climatic changes during and shortly after the main phase of volcanism. This will primarily b e based on biostratigraphic and geochemical analysis of the sedimentary succession immediatel y above the top of the basalt and possibly the sedimentary layers between basalt flows. The fourt h objective was to constrain the conditions in the melt region, specifically the composition of th e mantle before melting and the ambient temperature from the geochemistry and petrology of th e encountered rocks. Reaching this objective will help to parameterize geodynamic models that wil l distinguish between the relative importance of the drivers of excess volcanism.

Lofoten Basin (see Figure F1 in the U1573 chapter [Planke et al., 2023b].  

Furthermore, Sites U1571 and U1572 will address two auxiliary objectives laid out in the Scientifi c Prospectus. First, we hope to provide information on the suitability of the breakup basal t sequences and interbedded sediments for permanent geological storage of $C O_{2}$ . This will requir e obtaining information on their porosity and permeability as well as their geochemical composition, in particular the abundance of olivine, which may react with ${\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ . Second, we hope to obtai n information on the earliest incursion of deep water into the North Atlantic and the extent of majo r freshwater incursions into the young ocean (e.g., during the Azolla event) (Brinkhuis et al., 2006).  

Finally, and akin to the other sites, we will use the drilling results to test and calibrate the volcanological predictions of seismic volcanostratigraphy and igneous seismic geomorphology for th e Landward Flows and SDR and smaller scale volcanic elements identified in the seismic reflectio n data.  

# 5.5.2. Operations  

Site U1571 consists of two holes. Hole U1571A was cored using the RCB system to 247.6 mbsf an d then logged with the triple combo, FMS-sonic, and UBI logging tool strings. Although the origina l plan called for a single hole to $240\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ the poor recovery through a critical stratigraphic interva l suggested an additional hole should be cored at the site. The APC/XCB system was selected for th e second hole. Hole U1571B was cored with the APC system to refusal at 57.2 mbsf. The XCB corin g system was deployed and cored with good results through 143.7 mbsf. Polycrystalline diamon d compact (PDC) XCB cutting shoes were used to core through the hard layers between 125 an d 143.7 mbsf. Coring in Hole U1571B was terminated at $1005~\mathrm{h}$ on 11 September 2021. The dril l string was pulled back to the surface after clearing the seafloor at $1110\,\mathrm{h}$ . On clearing the seafloor, the vessel began moving in DP mode to the next site, which is located $3.1\;\mathrm{nmi}$ away. The APC/XC B coring bit cleared the rotary table at $1351\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1571B and Site U1571. A total of $124\,\mathrm{{h}}$ or 5.2 days were recorded while on Site U1571.  

A total of 59 cores were taken at Site U1571. The RCB system was used for Hole U1571A an d cored $247.6~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $116.55\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(47.1\%)$ . Hole U1571B used both the APC syste m and the XCB system. Seven APC cores were taken over a $57.2~\mathrm{m}$ interval. Recovery was $58.73~\mathrm{m}$ $(102.7\%)$ ). The XCB system was used for 13 cores over a $86.5\;\mathrm{m}$ interval and recovered $62.2\%$ of th e cored interval.  

Site U1572 also consists of two holes. Hole U1572A was cored using the RCB system to 330.5 mbs f and then logged with the triple combo tool string. Further logging was canceled because o f degrading hole conditions. The original plan called for a single hole to 320 mbsf. Poor recover y through a critical zone suggested an additional hole should be cored at the site. The APC/XC B coring system was selected for the second hole at the site. Hole U1572B was cored with the AP C and HLAPC systems to APC refusal at 209.6 mbsf. The XCB system was deployed, and the basement contact interval was cored to 224.3 mbsf. PDC XCB cutting shoes were used to core throug h the hard layers between 209.6 and 224.3 mbsf. Coring in Hole U1572B was terminated at $1045~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 September. The drill string was pulled back to the surface after clearing the seafloor at 123 5 h. On clearing the rotary table, the APC/XCB BHA was secured at $1612\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{r}}$ , ending Hole U1572B. The bridge was notified that the drill floor activities were complete. The thrusters and hydrophones were pulled back inside the hull of the vessel, and the vessel began the sea passage to Sit e U1573. A total of $122.5\,\mathrm{h}$ or 5.1 days were recorded while on Site U1572.  

A total of 79 cores were recorded at Site U1572. The RCB system was used for Hole U1572A t o core $330.5\:\mathrm{m}$ and recover $139.53\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(42.2\%)$ . Hole U1572B used the APC, HLAPC, and XC B systems. There were 16 APC cores recorded over a $149.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ interval. Recovery was $154.45\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(103.5\%)$ . The HLAPC system was used for 13 cores over a $60.3\:\mathrm{m}$ interval (recovery $=99.1\%$ ). Th e XCB system was used for 4 cores over a $14.7~\mathrm{m}$ interval (recovery $=28.3\%$ ).  

# 5.5.3. Principal results  

# 5.5.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The succession recovered from the four holes cored at Sites U1571 and U1572 is divided into eigh t lithostratigraphic units. Units I–VI are sedimentary, Unit VII is igneous, and Unit VIII is characterized by primarily igneous rock interbedded with sediment and volcaniclastics.  

Units were determined based on macroscopic observations and microscopic analysis and are supported by physical properties and biostratigraphy. Hole U1572A is the only hole that includes al l eight units. APC drilling was utilized in Holes U1572B and U1571B, where recovery of sediment s is more than $100\%$ in many sediment cores. Unit I is grayish brown and brown unconsolidate d mud. Unit II is greenish gray consolidated mud and nannofossil ooze. Unit III is greenish gra y mud, very dark gray diatomite, and diatom ooze. Unit IV consists of greenish gray radiolarian ooz e interbedded with gray to black ash. Unit V is very dark gray mudstone with parallel lamination an d dark gray ash. Unit VI is biosiliceous ooze with mudstone and common ash. Unit VII is basalti c andesite and basalt lava flows. Unit VIII consists of basalt and interbasalt sediments and is divide d into two distinct subunits. Subunit VIIIa is composed of hyaloclastite alternating with volcani c mudstone. Subunit VIIIb is an alternation of basaltic lava flows and minor mudstone. The presence of Unit VII as the top basement unit at Site U1572 constitutes the main difference betwee n the two sites and likely is the reason for the difference in seismic character.  

# 5.5.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

The Quaternary sediments recovered from the holes at Sites U1571 and U1572 (maximum $={\sim}80$ m) are characterized by glacially influenced hemipelagic muds, which typically unconformabl y overlie Miocene strata. Siliceous and organic-walled microfossils were found in various abundances below the Quaternary deposits. Also, indications are that the successions at Sites U157 1 and U1572 are very similar; Lower to late Middle Miocene strata overlie upper Lower to Uppe r Eocene strata, with some Lower Oligocene sediments, especially in Hole U1572B.  

In Holes U1571B, U1572A, and U1572B, sediments recovered from directly above the igneou s basement yield Azolla spp. and associated dinocyst marker species. The well-documented Nordi c Sea Azolla phase has been dated as occurring between ${\sim}49$ and $48\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (mid-Chron C22n to midChron C21r) at the end of the Early Eocene (Ypresian) (e.g., Brinkhuis et al., 2006; Barke et al., 2011). This constrains the earliest sediment accumulation to the very end of, or directly postdating, the EECO as defined by Westerhold et al. (2018). The Middle to Late Eocene appears to b e marked by a progressive deepening or increasing distance to shore. Because of the general absenc e of microfossils, no biostratigraphic age constraints are available from between the igneous units.  

The microfossil-rich sedimentary succession in Hole U1572B was utilized to construct an integrated age-depth model, and the correlation to the shipboard paleomagnetic reversal interpretation and lithostratigraphic units is shown in Figures F16 and F17 and Table T5.  

# 5.5.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

The low recovery in Holes U1571A and U1572A prevents the construction of a meaningful magnetostratigraphic record; however, better magnetostratigraphic results were obtained from Hole s U1571B and U1572B. Lithostratigraphic Unit I shows mainly normal polarities in the uppermos t $40\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , although the increase of the $I_{\mathrm{20mT}}/\mathrm{NRM}$ ratio with depth suggests a possible climatic change. The upper and lowermost parts of Unit II show normal polarity with a reversed polarity in th e lower part. Unit III has the lowest magnetic intensities $\left(I_{\mathrm{NRM}}<10^{-4}\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}\right)$ for these sites. The dominantly normal polarities might be caused by drilling-induced magnetization. Unit IV show s evenly normal and reversed polarities. Unit V has exclusively normal polarities that are validate d by discrete samples. Unit VI shows a mixture of normal and reversed polarities. The basalti c sequences show strong magnetization intensities with dominantly reversed polarities, all validate d by discrete samples. The magnetic carrier in these basalts has a low coercivity and may potentiall y carry a viscous remanent magnetization that could be used for core reorientation. The anisotrop y of MS (AMS) of sediments shows that correction of magnetic inclination for inclination shallowing will not be necessary (Figure F13). The basalts carry a strong AMS resulting from viscous flow.  

# 5.5.3.4. Geochemistry  

The recovered basalt sequence from the Skoll High shows chemical and spatial variations betwee n Sites U1571 and U1572. For example, $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ concentrations indicate the presence of occasiona l high-Ti basalts, usually associated with LIPs and overlap with high-Ti basalts from East Greenlan d and flows found during previous drilling in Hole 642E during ODP Leg 104 (Figure F11). Th e compositions of the uppermost basalts at the two sites appear to be representative of two differen t flow units. This supports the lithostratigraphic interpretation of an additional unit (Lithostratigraphic Unit VII) at the top of the Unit VIII basalts at Site U1572. IW recovered from interbasal t sediments shows unusually high pH and low alkalinity for saline water. Basalt alteration and associated clay authigenesis at Sites U1571 and U1572 likely result in enriched IW calcium content s (released during clay formation) and depleted Mg and K as these elements are incorporated int o the clays. Elements in IW samples from the basalt–sediment transition to $50{-}100\;\mathrm{m}$ above it sho w largely conservative behavior downcore. Dissolved Si concentrations are sporadically enriched, and these intervals correspond to ash- or diatom-rich strata or both (e.g., Unit III). This is indicative of marine silicate weathering, and the high interstitial silica preserves some original features o f volcanic glass, diatoms, and organic matter.

# 5.5.3.5. Physical properties  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I comprises relatively high GRA bulk densities $({\sim}1.74\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ and NGR (4 2 counts/s) that transition abruptly downward into Units II and III, which generally comprise lowe r GRA bulk density $(\mathrm{{\sim}}1.4\mathrm{{-}}1.5\mathrm{{\:}g/c m^{3}})$ and NGR (\~23–25 counts/s) with an accompanying reductio n in MS. The underlying Miocene to Eocene strata comprising Units $\mathrm{IV}{-}\mathrm{VI}$ are best preserved i n Hole U1572B, where Units IV and VI reveal elevated NGR (mean $=>\!30$ counts/s) compared wit h the intervening Unit V (mean $=21$ counts/s); MS is also elevated in these intervals, which is likel y linked to increased ash content in the Eocene.  

The basaltic andesite–dominated Unit VII is characterized by high GRA bulk densities (2.5 3 $\mathbf{g}/\mathbf{cm}^{3})$ and $P$ -wave velocities $(4120\;\mathrm{m/s})$ and low NGR (11 counts/s) in line with the data recorde d for the basalt interiors found in Subunit VIIIb but at slightly higher NGR associated with the mor e evolved compositions. Point MS (MSP) and MS (592 and $401\times10^{-5}$ [SI]) are a factor of 10 highe r than for the overlying sedimentary units but about half that observed for the underlying basaltdominated Unit VIII.

Figure F17. Lithostratigraphic and chronobiostratigraphic correlation panel, Sites U1571 and U1572. Note the absence of the Upper Eocene section at Site U1571. $?=$ unknown age.  

A clear distinction is seen between the hyaloclastite Subunit VIIIa and lava-dominated Subuni t VIIIb. The former has relatively low $P$ -wave velocities $({\sim}1800\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ and GRA bulk densities $_{(\sim1.55}$ $\mathbf{g}/\mathbf{cm}^{3})$ more in line with the low velocity, low bulk density interbasaltic sediments. Subunit VIII b lavas reveal clear asymmetrical profiles of $P$ -wave velocity and GRA bulk density ranging fro m ${\sim}5000\,\mathrm{m/s}$ and $2.9\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively, in the massive flow interiors to as low as ${\sim}2000\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ and 1. 5 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , respectively, for porous and variably altered flow tops and bases. Calculated grain densitie s average $3~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ for the basaltic sequences and exceed $3.1~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in some cases, attesting to th e undifferentiated nature of the basaltic magmas that fed the sequence. Abundant primary por e spaces in the form of unfilled vesicles are identified throughout the volcanic sequence, leading t o calculated porosities commonly ${>}30\%$ , whereas in certain cases these pores are filled with secondary minerals such as calcite and zeolite.

# 5.5.3.6. Downhole measurements  

Wireline logging operations delivered a comprehensive data set covering approximately $147\,\textrm{m}$ (about $80\textrm{m}$ basaltic basement) in Hole U1571A and approximately $157~\mathrm{m}$ (about $45\textrm{m}$ basalti c basement) in Hole U1572A (Figure F12). Gamma radiation logging data aided in constraining th e nature and distribution of more evolved igneous compositions in Lithostratigraphic Subunit VIIIa. A key objective of the Skoll High sites was to constrain the nature of different seismic facies associated with the top basalt reflector between the two sites, in particular the pitted surface seismi c facies associated with Hole U1572A. The transition from sediment- to volcanic-dominate d sequences in Hole U1571A comprises a more protracted sequence of interlayered hard volcani c units and softer sediments. In contrast, the transition from the sediments to the volcanic sequenc e in Hole U1572A is sharper, with an initial abrupt increase in density, PEF, and MS followed by  a gradual increase in density over the following ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ culminating in a sharp increase in resistivit y at ${\sim}220\mathrm{~m~}$ . Core observations suggest abundant lava-water interaction for Unit VIII, suggestin g massive subaqueous flows and volcaniclastic units. This is consistent with the wireline data.  

Gamma radiation also aided the identification and thickness quantification of several interlav a sedimentary units that will form key future targets for palynology and isotopic age dating efforts t o appraise the timing and environmental conditions of the eruption sequence. FMS image log dat a revealed high-resolution imaging of intricate volcanic intrafacies features such as ubiquitou s unfilled vesicles, mineralized amygdules, pipe vesicles, and pillow lava features indicative of aqueous eruptions during the volcanic pile evolution.  

# 5.6. Site U1573  

Site U1573 consists of one RCB hole that aimed to characterize the basement nature of the Oute r SDR. Hole U1573A resulted in coring about $90\;\mathrm{m}$ of late Early Eocene sediments that lie on top o f basaltic basement. The $54\,\textrm{m}$ of drilled basement consists of massive sheet flows that wer e emplaced in a shallow marine setting and are interlayered by sediments. The upper $300\;\mathrm{m}$ of th e shallow sediments at the site were washed because an approaching storm did not leave enoug h time to core the entire hole.  

# 5.6.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1573 is located in the southern part of the Lofoten Basin just north of the Vøring Plateau a t a $3167~\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figure F15) and on Magnetic Anomaly 23 near the border between th e Vøring and Lofoten Margins. This part of the Vøring Margin has rarely been explored since th e 1960s and 1970s. The only available basement samples prior to Expedition 396 in this area ar e from DSDP Leg 38 Site 343 (Talwani, Udintsev, et al., 1976), during which basement from 253 t o 284 mbsf was drilled and about $5\;\mathrm{m}$ of highly altered basalts that were interpreted to be part of  a sill intrusion were recovered.  

Compared to the Vøring Margin, the Lofoten Margin is characterized by a narrower rift system, less extensive breakup-related magmatic crustal thickening, and a rapid increase of water dept h from the shelf into the Lofoten Basin. The Lofoten Margin consists of three segments that ar e characterized by different fault dip directions and separated by crustal transfer systems (Tsikala s et al., 2001). The southernmost transfer system, the Bivrost Lineament, separates the Lofote n Margin from the Vøring Margin. Wide-angle seismic data suggest ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{km}$ thick oceanic crust i n the southern part of the Lofoten Basin, much thinner than the about $20~\mathrm{km}$ thick crust of th e Vøring Plateau (Breivik et al., 2009). This difference in crustal thickness should have resulted in  a vertical movement history of the Lofoten Margin that is very different than that of the Vørin g Margin. The Early Eocene bathymetric gradient from the Vøring to the Lofoten Margins predict s a $500{-}1000\ \mathrm{m}$ water depth on the Lofoten Margin during breakup (Tsikalas et al., 2008). Thi s implies contemporaneous submarine lava emplacement on the Lofoten Margin and subaerial lav a emplacement on the Vøring Margin (Eldholm et al., 1989). This bathymetric gradient has bee n attributed to rapid initial margin subsidence along a deep-rooted low-angle detachment fault (Tsikalas et al., 2008). Reflection seismic data reveal a horizontal basement reflection underlain b y SDR with lower seismic amplitude and shorter lateral extent than the main set of SDR on th e Vøring Margin.  

The stark difference between the subaerial lava flows at ODP Site 642 and the submarine conditions predicted by gravity modeling require distinctly different subsidence histories for the Vørin g and Lofoten Margins. Thus, the first objective of drilling Site U1573 was to obtain information o n the emplacement environment based on the facies of the recovered basalt and sediments. As such, reaching this first objective directly tests the predictions of seismic volcanostratigraphy. The second objective was to establish the timing of volcanism on the Lofoten Margin, in particula r whether there is evidence of a time gap between the emplacement of the SDR of the Vøring Margi n on Skoll High (Sites U1571 and U1572) and the Outer SDR. The third objective of Site U1573 wa s to constrain the conditions in the melt region during this presumably late phase of breakup volcanism. This includes not only any constraints on the composition of the mantle before melting an d the ambient temperature and pressure from the geochemistry and petrology of the encountere d rocks but also any signs of evolution of the melts in crustal magma chambers during breaku p volcanism.  

# 5.6.2. Operations  

Site U1573 consists of a single hole drilled first without coring using the RCB system with a cente r bit from the seafloor to 300.0 mbsf and then cored to a final depth of $440.9\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , including $54.4\;\mathrm{m}$ into basement. The average penetration rate in the basement section was ${\sim}1.82~\mathrm{m/h}$ . There wer e frequent jammed liners and core catchers that contributed to relatively low core recovery rate s within the basement (average $=43\%$ ). Coring in Hole U1573A was terminated at $1830~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 0 September 2021 because of severe weather and heavy sea conditions that were expected over th e operational area for the following day. The last core recovered was Core 19R at $1925\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 September. The drill string was pulled back on board at $2200\,\mathrm{h}$ . The BHA was broken down, and th e drill collars were secured in the drill collar rack. The rig floor was secured at $0705\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 September, ending Hole U1573A and Site U1573. A total of $101.0\,\mathrm{h}$ or 4.2 days were spent on site. A tota l of 18 cores were recovered using the RCB system over $140.9\;\mathrm{m}$ recovering $101\mathrm{~m~}(72\%)$ .  

# 5.6.3. Principal results  

# 5.6.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Site U1573 consists of a single hole that was drilled to $440.9\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , with the recovered cor e interval spanning 300 to $440.9\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The $140.9\;\mathrm{m}$ thick succession consists of both sediment s and basalts that are divided into four lithostratigraphic units. The criteria for the division of th e units are based on significant lithologic changes, which are supported by physical properties variability. Lithostratigraphic Units I–III are sedimentary, and Unit IV consists of basalt and interbasaltic sediments.  

Unit I consists of dark greenish gray to very dark gray claystone with rare weak parallel laminatio n or fining-upward sequences. Slight to heavy bioturbation is present throughout the unit, and diagenetic pyrite is observed locally. Unit II consists of dark greenish gray to very dark gray clayston e with moderate bioturbation alternating with very dark gray organic-rich claystone with thin parallel lamination. Rare ash beds or ash-rich beds are present locally. Unit III consists of very dark gra y to very dark bluish gray volcaniclastic claystone mudstone with sand. Unit IV consists mainly o f gray to dark gray aphyric aphanitic to phaneritic basalt and interbasaltic claystone to sandstone.  

# 5.6.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

All sedimentary core catcher samples and selected samples from intercalated sedimentary beds i n the igneous facies from Hole U1573A were processed for calcareous, siliceous, and organic microfossils. Calcareous and siliceous biogenic material was largely absent, with the exception of rar e calcareous nannofossil occurrences in the lower several meters above basalt. However, mos t samples were productive for palynology, including some samples from between the igneous facies, and most yielded age diagnostic dinocysts, which indicate a late Early Eocene age for the entir e interval.  

# 5.6.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I is characterized by an average intensity of magnetization of $0.05\,\mathrm{A/m}$ an d a median coercivity of 2.73. This coercivity may be owed to sedimentary hematite or goethite. Th e unique discrete sample measured is not ferromagnetic, devoid of magnetite, because the averag e bulk MS is $0.447\times10^{-3}$ [SI].  

Unit II has an $0.05\,\mathrm{A/m}$ average intensity of magnetization. The median coercivity (3.04), MS $\kappa<$ $1.03\times10^{-3}$ [SI]), and corrected degree of anisotropy $\left(P^{\prime}<1.105\right)$ are higher than in Unit I. High κ results from small contributions from magnetite. High coercivity and $P^{\prime}$ may be due to a highe r goethite/hematite ratio or a larger iron sulfide (e.g., pyrrhotite) population in the ash or both. Multiple minerals carrying remanence are evident from the three types of remanent magnetizatio n identified in four discrete samples. The low- and medium-coercivity component is erased by AF s of 20 and $70\,\mathrm{mT}$ , respectively. The high-coercivity component is stable throughout the demagnetization process, specifically in the $120\;\mathrm{mT}$ field.  

Unit III has an average intensity of magnetization of $0.07\ \mathrm{A/m_{z}}$ which is slightly higher than i n Units I and II. In contrast, the medium coercivity (2.53) is lower than in Units I and II. Lowe r median coercivity can be related to domination of volcanic material, which usually is richer in iro n sulfide (e.g., pyrrhotite) but poorer in goethite and hematite. Note that goethite and hematite hav e higher coercivity than iron sulfides. No discrete samples were measured.  

Unit IV has high average intensity of magnetization $\left(2.6\;\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}\right)$ and high median coercivity (6.02). Such high coercivities may be owed to a larger goethite/hematite ratio. The unit is ferromagneti c with the highest bulk MS of all the units, indicating the dominance of magnetite. However, th e corrected degree of anisotropy is the lowest among all the units. This indicates that the magneti c fabrics are carried dominantly by magnetite and the populations of pyrrhotite and hematite ar e small. Three magnetization components are conspicuous from the demagnetization behavior o f the discrete samples.  

Unit I has four short periods of magnetic reversals between Sections 396-U1573A-2R-1 (30 0 mbsf) and 2R-5 $\left(306.71\:\mathrm{m}\right)$ ). This is followed by a long episode of magnetic reversal in Sections 4R2 (321.05 mbsf) through 5R-5 (333.91 mbsf) in Unit II. After this, the magnetic polarity flips several times at a relatively higher frequency (within a couple meters) to Section 7R-3 (350.98 mbsf); it then remains reversed through Section 8R-3 (361.72 mbsf). After that, the polarity stays dominantly normal in the rest of the hole through Section 18R-2 (436.74 mbsf). Preliminary data fro m paleomagnetic analyses suggest a predominance of normal polarity at the top of the cored succession, which we tentatively assign to Magnetochron $C22\mathrm{n}$ (48.57–49.34 Ma).  

# 5.6.3.4. Geochemistry  

Site U1573 provided a unique opportunity to sample an Outer SDR sequence on a magma-ric h passive continental margin. The sampled lavas are noteworthy in that the higher silica and low-T i compositions are chemically distinct from both typical mid-ocean-ridge basalts and LIP magmatism. The sedimentary package recovered above the lavas is limited to $100\;\mathrm{m}$ . As seen at previou s sites, high organic matter production or preservation is found in volcaniclastic sediments, suggesting a causal relationship. The IW samples show a diagenetic environment controlled by basal t weathering, with processes consuming alkalinity in the overlying sedimentary strata. There is als o strong evidence of authigenic carbonate formation above the sediment/basalt contact, linked t o the liberation of Ca during the weathering of primary silicates.  

# 5.6.3.5. Physical properties  

Lithostratigraphic Units I and II are characterized by downward increasing density (from ${\sim}1.6$ t o ${\sim}2~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ ) consistent with increasing compaction. NGR fluctuates between ${\sim}30$ and 60 counts/ s and displays a general increase with depth. Increased scatter in MS is observed over ash-rich intervals within sedimentary sections. The hard rock basement sequence comprises generally very lo w NGR, typically $^{<10}$ counts/s, consistent with the basalt-dominated compositions, and has generally high density (mean GRA bulk density $=2.28~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ ; mean MAD grain density $=2.83\ \mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ ) and velocities $\mathrm{(mean\,=\,3660~m/s)}$ ). The presence and nature of interlava sediments with lowe r velocity $({\sim}2000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ ) compared to the higher velocity basaltic flows $({\sim}4500\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ ) give first insight s into the geological causes of the Outer SDR seismic reflectivity.  

# 5.7. Site U1574  

Three holes were drilled at Site U1574 targeting the basement and the overlying sedimentar y sequence of an Outer High, Eldhø, located on the northern flank of the Vøring Plateau. Hol e U1574A was drilled with the RCB system and sampled $94\;\mathrm{m}$ of pillow basalts, hyaloclastites, and  a ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ thick interbasaltic sedimentary interval. Both triple combo and FMS-sonic wireline lo g data were acquired in the basement. Only one APC core was collected in Hole U1574B, whereas  a $170~\mathrm{m}$ thick sequence of sediments was almost completely recovered using APC coring in Hol e U1574C. The last core of the expedition was an XCB core recovering $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of pillow and massiv e basalts, sediments, and hyaloclastites.  

# 5.7.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1574 probes the top of an Outer High called Eldhø (Figure F15). It is located on the norther n flank of the Vøring Plateau at a $2825\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth. Outer Highs are conspicuous volcanic seismi c facies units that are located seaward of the Inner SDR facies units (Hopper et al., 1992; Planke e t al., 2000; Franke et al., 2019). Although most volcanic seismic facies units are relatively continuou s along a rifted margin, Outer Highs have a limited lateral extent of typically $10{-}20~\mathrm{km}$ (Berndt e t al., 2001a). They form elongate structures that rise above the top of the adjacent Inner and Oute r SDR. Seismically, Outer Highs frequently display a high-amplitude top reflection of normal seismic polarity, chaotic internal reflection patterns, and high-amplitude reflections that extend fro m the Outer High into adjacent sedimentary sequences that overlie the SDR.  

Because Outer Highs are characteristic features of volcanic rifted margins located between Inne r and Outer SDR, their presence likely signifies specific geological processes and provides clues t o the evolution of volcanic passive margins. Precruise interpretations of Outer Highs mainly relie d on seismic volcanostratigraphic interpretations, field analogs, and geological reasoning. The facie s unit was interpreted as dominantly hyaloclastite deposits formed when the eruption fissures wer e submerged during the initial phase of seafloor spreading. In this situation, eruptions would happen at sea level or in shallow marine conditions and lava would get into direct contact with seawater, leading to phreatomagmatic eruptions. The formation of Surtsey between 1964 and 1968 ma y serve as a recent analog (Kokelaar, 1983).  

The structure targeted at Site U1574 is a typical example of an Outer High (Figure F7B). We cal l this structure Eldhø, meaning fire mountain in Scandinavian languages. The name is also inspire d by the achievements of Professor Olav Eldholm, a pioneer in drilling and defining the concepts o f volcanic margins and LIPs (e.g., Eldholm et al., 1989). Eldhø rises more than $1500\mathrm{~m~}$ above th e adjacent Inner SDR in the southeast and about $650\;\mathrm{m}$ above the Outer SDR in the northwest wit h numerous high-amplitude seismic reflections that transgress into the adjacent sedimentary basin s south of the high. Its lateral extent is about $17\,\mathrm{km}$ in the dip direction (northwest–southeast) an d about $30\,\mathrm{km}$ along strike (southwest–northeast). A sedimentary basin, the Eldhø Basin, which ha s kilometer-thick postbasalt sediment deposits, is located landward of Eldhø.  

The first objective of Site U1574 was to obtain information on the emplacement environmen t based on observations of the drilled volcanic facies. If Eldhø was indeed emplaced close to se a level, this will validate these aspects of seismic volcanostratigraphy, and their presence may the n be used as a marker for vertical movement. The second objective was to constrain the condition s in the melt region, specifically the composition of the mantle before melting and the ambient temperature and pressure conditions in the melt region during the late phase of breakup volcanis m based on the geochemical composition and petrology of the encountered rocks. Reaching the firs t two objectives will allow us to parameterize geodynamic models for excessive breakup volcanism.  

Site U1574 was also drilled to provide information on the suitability of the breakup basal t sequences and interbedded sediments for permanent geological storage of $C O_{2}$ . If the Outer High s indeed consist mainly of hyaloclastite deposits as postulated, they should be characterized by hig h porosity and permeability, which may make them a suitable target $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ storage. Finally, we hope d to obtain information on the earliest incursion of deep water into the North Atlantic and th e extent of freshwater incursions into the young ocean during the Early to Middle Eocene (Brinkhui s et al., 2006) by coring the overlying sedimentary strata.  

# 5.7.2. Operations  

Site U1574 consists of three holes. The first hole was cored using the RCB coring system (Figur e F4) from the seafloor to 260.0 mbsf and then logged with the triple combo and FMS-sonic loggin g tool strings. The original plan for Site U1574 was to core a single hole to 310 mbsf, but the objectives were achieved by 260 mbsf. After completing Hole U1574A, it was decided that the remaining expedition time would be used to piston core the sediment section above the basement and t o attempt to improve recovery of the sediment/basement interface. The APC/XCB coring syste m was selected for the second hole at the site. After assembling and lowering the APC/XCB syste m to the seafloor, the first APC core misfired and penetrated the seafloor at least twice. Hole U1574 B was terminated after the poor mudline core at 9.5 mbsf. The vessel was offset $20\textrm{m}$ south, an d Hole U1574C was APC cored to 169.2 mbsf. We conducted four borehole temperature measurements with the advanced piston corer temperature (APCT-3) tool on Cores 4H (38.0 mbsf), 7 H (66.1 mbsf), 10H (94.6 mbsf), and 13H (118.7 mbsf). The Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool wa s deployed for the first 10 cores. The XCB coring system was deployed after the last APC core an d immediately cored the basement. A PDC XCB cutting shoe was used to core a hard layer at 169. 2 mbsf. Coring in Hole U1574C was terminated at $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 October 2021 at a final depth of 171. 5 mbsf. The last core was on deck at $1655\ \mathrm{h}$ . All coring tools were put away. The drill string wa s pulled back to the surface after clearing the seafloor at $1920\,\mathrm{h}$ . The drill collars were laid out to th e drill collar racks, and the outer core barrel was disassembled and secured. The drill floor wa s secured for transit at $0231\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 October, ending Hole U1574C and Site U1574. A total of $182.5\,\mathrm{h}$ or 7.6 days were recorded while on Site U1574.  

A total of 59 cores were recorded for the site. The RCB system was used exclusively for Hol e U1574A, coring $260.0\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovering $88.41\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(34\%)$ . The APC system was used in bot h Holes U1574B and U1574C. A total of 20 APC cores were recovered over a $178.7\,\textrm{m}$ interval, recovering $183.27\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(103\%)$ . The XCB system was used for one core over a $2.3\;\mathrm{m}$ interva l and recovered $64\%$ of the cored interval.  

# 5.7.3. Principal results  

# 5.7.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Site U1574 is located on the lower slope of the Vøring Plateau, on the southern flank of Eldhø. Thi s Outer High was likely formed by subaqueous volcanism during the initial phase of seafloo r spreading. The succession of recovered material consists of both sediments and basalts and i s divided into five lithostratigraphic units. The division of the units is based on changes in lithology, which coincide with changes in physical property trends. Lithostratigraphic Units I–IV are sedimentary, and Unit V consists of basalt, hyaloclastite, and minor interbasaltic sediments.  

Unit I consists of brown and brownish gray unconsolidated mud with intervals of rare pebbles, likely related to ice-rafted debris, and rare to common foraminifers. Unit II consists of pale yello w and grayish green consolidated mud, in which the first Eocene-aged dinocyst zonations ar e encountered. Unit III is very dark gray mudstone with rare beds of sandstone and ash and som e parallel lamination and bioturbation, showing an increase in organic content downhole. Unit IV i s very dark gray to very dark grayish brown organic rich mudstone with thin parallel lamination. Compared to the overlying units, Unit IV is richer in foraminifers and nannofossils, with abundances increasing downhole in the unit.  

Unit V mainly consists of aphyric- to plagioclase-phyric pillow basalt with localized hyaloclastit e and rare interbedded mudstone. Unit V is divided into two subunits (Va and Vb) based on lithologic and geochemical variations. Both subunits are separated by a large interval of no recovery t o very poor recovery of sediments, and both are overlain by hyaloclastites. Subunit Va contains bot h massive and pillow basalts and shows significant variation of composition with depth. Subunit V b contains primarily pillow basalt and presents remarkably uniform composition.  

# 5.7.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

Except for Cores 396-U1574A-1R through 3R, all sedimentary core catcher samples from Hol e U1574A were processed for palynology. These samples, including two taken from between basal t flows (Samples 32R-CC and 33R-CC), are assigned a late Early Eocene age based on marker dinocyst taxa and broader assemblage characteristics. The overlying Quaternary strata yield calcareous and rare biosiliceous fossil remains, but these are largely absent from most of the expande d late Early Eocene strata. A significant exception is the lower ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{m}$ of sediment on top of the igneous basement (Samples 17R-CC and 18R-CC), which contains calcareous remains, including calcareous nannofossils, planktonic and benthic foraminifers, (micro)molluscs, and fine preservatio n of aragonitic pteropods. Benthic foraminifers are mostly mineral filled, and diatoms are replace d by or coated with pyrite (micro)framboids. These samples are tentatively attributed to planktoni c foraminifer Zone E7a of Wade et al. (2011), in line with inferences from dinocyst biostratigraphy.  

# 5.7.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Lithostratigraphic Units I–III are characterized by low average intensity of magnetization (0.02, 0.006, and $0.02\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{z}}$ respectively), whereas their median coercivity is 1.69, 1.31, and 0.87, respectively. The lower intensity of magnetization and coercivity may be owed to a smaller population o f magnetic minerals. No discrete samples were measured for these three units. Unit IV has a slightl y higher average intensity of magnetization $(0.006\,\mathrm{A/m})$ than Units I–II. The bulk MS is $1.06\times10^{-3}$ to $0.014\times10^{-3}$ [SI], indicating a ferro $^+$ paramagnetic AMS without magnetite. Median coercivit y is much higher than in Units I–III. The corrected degree of anisotropy in the range of ${\sim}1.1$ an d median coercivity of 2.61 indicate the absence of micaceous minerals and a higher population o f goethite and hematite, respectively. Only one of the two discrete samples presents stable magnetization directions (Sample 396-U1574A-17R-1, 111–113 cm). The low-coercivity remanent magnetization component is erased by a field of $10\;\mathrm{mT}$ . The high-coercivity component is removed a t an applied field of $100\;\mathrm{mT}$ .  

The average intensity of magnetization $(4.38\,\mathrm{A/m})$ in Unit V is several orders of magnitude highe r than in the other units. The median coercivity (2.61) is the same as in Unit IV. The bulk MS i s $\mathord{\sim}15\times10^{-3}$ [SI], and the corrected degree of anisotropy is $P^{\prime}\sim\!1.1$ . Two magnetization component s are evident. The low-coercivity component is erased by application of a field of $10\;\mathrm{mT}$ . The highcoercivity component is removed by a field of $40{-}60\ \mathrm{mT}$ . The magnetic signals are apparentl y carried by magnetite.  

Magnetic polarity is normal through Section 396-U1574A-4R-2 (31.05 mbsf). The polarity the n remains dominantly reversed to the bottom of the hole (Section 38R-3; 258.15 mbsf). This long, dominantly reversed polarity episode is truncated by short-lived positive polarity events.  

# 5.7.3.4. Geochemistry  

At Site U1574, Lithostratigraphic Unit IV consists of low-Ti basalts. Significant variability of som e geochemical parameters ( $\mathrm{TiO}_{2},$ Mg#, Ni, and $Z\mathbf{r}$ ) downcore suggests recovery of multiple flo w units. Interbasalt sediments contain what appears to be dolomite.  

IW compositions in Units I–III indicate a diagenetic environment dominated by the weathering o f primary silicate phases and the formation of authigenic clays and carbonate. Calcium and S r decrease downcore due to their release in the formation of smectite and other clay minerals. Th e same formation reactions lead to the removal of Mg and K from the IW, resulting in decreasing $\mathrm{Mg}$ and K content downcore. Enrichment of other elements (e.g., Si and B) in the upper $40\;\mathrm{m}$ of th e core suggest a lithology-controlled elemental composition of the IW.  

# 5.7.3.5. Physical properties  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I has high bulk densities $\mathrm{(mean\,=\,1.82\g/cm^{3})}$ and NGR (average $=\,38$ counts/s) and relatively low $P$ -wave velocities $({\sim}1575~\mathrm{m/s})$ and MS $(\sim\!45\times10^{-5}$ [SI]). Eight MA D samples collected throughout this unit have an average bulk density of $1.82\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , grain density o f $2.76~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and porosity of $54\%$ . Six thermal conductivity measurements range $1.1{-}1.5\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ (average $=1.3\;\mathrm{W/[m\cdotK]})$ .  

In Unit II, $P$ -wave velocities, GRA bulk densities, MS, and NGR average ${\sim}1550~\mathrm{m/s},\,1.43~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ , ${\sim}21\times10^{-5}$ [SI], and 19 counts/s, respectively. Analysis of two MAD samples revealed very hig h porosities of $83\%$ , a grain density of $2.70\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and a bulk density of $1.31\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , consistent wit h poorly compacted clay-rich sediments.  

A total of 25 discrete MAD sample analyses indicate a mean bulk density of $1.59\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ for the ${\sim}90$ m thick Eocene Unit III, slightly lower than the mean GRA bulk density of $1.62\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Porositie s range $37\%{-}82\%$ . The baseline values of the measured physical properties generally increase wit h depth throughout Unit III. Whole-round $P$ -wave velocities average $1560~\mathrm{m/s}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , ${\sim}250~\mathrm{m/s}$ slowe r than velocities measured through 30 discrete $P_{-}$ -wave caliper measurements using the SHMG, an d have a significant spread with a standard deviation of $120.5\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . MS increases compared to Unit I I (average $=105\times10^{-5}$ [SI]) and features increased scattering linked to the occurrence of ash layers.  

Reduced MS scatter $(\mathrm{mean}\,=\,{\sim}90\,\times\,10^{-5}$ [SI]) is observed for Unit IV. Mean GRA $({\sim}1.83~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ and MAD $({\sim}1.73\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ; $n=8.$ ) bulk densities correspond well to an associated average porosity o f $59\%$ . Whole-round $P$ -wave velocities with a mean of $1565~\mathrm{m/s}$ are within $20~\mathrm{m/s}$ of the mea n recorded using $P$ -wave caliper measurements and similar to average $P$ -wave velocities found fo r Unit III. NGR increases slightly compared to the overlying unit and has a constant value around 5 1 counts/s.  

The massive basalt and pillow basalts from Unit V have significantly higher $P$ -wave velocities, bul k densities $(2.4{-}2.6\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , and MS $1000{-}2000\times10^{-5}$ [SI]) than those found for the overlying sedimentary successions. Similar to interbasaltic sediments, the NGR counts, $P.$ -wave velocities, an d bulk densities measured for the hyaloclastite intervals feature a similar but inverse response t o those measured for the pillow and massive basalts because $P$ -wave velocities were on averag e $1000{-}1500\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ lower than the $4000{-}5000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ typically associated with the pillow lavas and massive intervals. Mean $P_{-}$ -wave velocities of the massive basalt intervals typically featured on th e lower end of this range. The unit has relatively low porosities $\left(15\%{-}20\%\right)$ , although significantl y higher porosities are recorded for the interbasaltic layers.  

# 5.7.3.6. Downhole logging  

Logging operations collected important data for intervals with poor core recovery in challengin g logging conditions where hole instability resulted in only partial data collection for the botto m ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m}$ of the open hole section. The basaltic composition pillow lavas are characterized by hig h densities $({\sim}2.6~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ and fluctuating velocities ranging ${\sim}3\mathrm{-}5.2\,\mathrm{km/s}$ with associated low gamm a radiation $(\sim\!9\;\mathrm{gAPI})$ . FMS imaging of the formation reveals pillow structures and the presence o f lava flow units, which correspond to highly vesicular basalt in the recovered core. Wireline dat a also show the presence of three thin elevated gamma radiation sediment layers along with a muc h thicker interval of high gamma radiation $({\sim}70~\mathrm{gAPI})$ stratigraphy associated with an interval o f ${\sim}30\;\mathrm{m}$ with almost no core recovery. This layer is imaged with the FMS, which records a resistiv e fractured nature with traces of potential pillow-like features and possible sediment layerin g toward the base.  

# 6. Preliminary scientific assessment  

During Expedition 396, we collected data from 21 boreholes in five different geological setting s along the volcanic rifted margin off mid-Norway. The boreholes probe almost all elements of  a typical volcanic rifted margin and the associated sedimentary archive. Recovery ranges from th e subbasalt stratigraphy through hydrothermal vent complex deposits, thick flood basalts deposit s in SDR sequences to postbreakup phreatomagmatic volcanoes, and basalts representing thickene d oceanic crust formed during early seafloor spreading. The cored sediments include a comprehensive record of the Upper Paleocene and Lower Eocene strata, including expanded sections of th e PETM. Thick Lower Eocene sediments recovered above the uppermost basalt horizon documen t the environment and subsidence history of the margin during the initial stages of northeast Atlantic Ocean formation. Along with an enormous amount of high-quality 2-D and 3-D seismic dat a and legacy boreholes from DSDP, ODP, and the NPD, Expedition 396 results will allow us to asses s and reevaluate the development of volcanic rifted margins and the implications of LIPs on paleoclimate and mass extinctions.  

In spite of the ambitious work program set out in the Scientific Prospectus, it was possible to significantly surpass our operational and scientific objectives. The expedition results provide a scientific database much broader than anticipated and should allow us to reach all the expedition’ s objectives during postcruise work.  

# 6.1. Primary objectives  

The first main objective of the expedition was to constrain the tectonomagmatic processes tha t lead to excess volcanism during the formation of a new ocean. Magmatism is controlled by th e composition and rheological properties of the upper mantle, the initial pressure and temperatur e conditions, and the tectonically controlled unloading of the mantle through space and time. Thes e boundary conditions will ultimately control the response of the system, including induced convection, passive, and active upwelling—processes that move mantle material into the melt window. We drilled $587\,\textrm{m}$ of breakup-related basalts in eight different holes that cover a wide range o f compositions. Cores from these holes will allow us to constrain the pressure and temperatur e conditions and the composition of the upper mantle during various phases of breakup volcanis m through geochemical analyses, whereas the age of the magmatism will be constrained by geochronology. The igneous rocks comprise the main Inner SDR units, the Outer High, and the Oute r SDR unit as well as an enigmatic dacitic unit along the Vøring Transform Margin. These Expedition 396 data will be complemented by boreholes into a lava delta on the Møre Margin by NP D and samples of the earliest lava flows on the Vøring Margin that were recovered in ODP Hol e 642E. High-precision radiometric dating, biostratigraphy of interbasalt sediments, and paleomagnetic studies will allow us to constrain the age and rates of the magmatism in unprecedente d detail. Furthermore, the samples allow a direct assessment of the paleowater depth, specifically, subaerial versus marine emplacement of the extrusive basalts. Along with paleoenvironmenta l studies of the immediate sedimentary succession above the basalts by biostratigraphic and sedimentological analyses, this will constrain the vertical movements of the margin and by proxy (an d in conjunction with the geophysically constrained magmatic crustal thickening) the rifting histor y of the margin. This is a main boundary condition for numerical simulation of the tectonomagmatic breakup processes that will allow us to reach the first objective of the expedition.  

The second main objective of the expedition was to study the environmental consequences o f breakup volcanism through time. Breakup volcanism in the northeast Atlantic was accompanie d by a phase of rapid global warming, the so-called PETM. With the results of Expedition 396, an d Sites U1567 and U1568 specifically, we will test if the observed global warming may have bee n induced by magmatic intrusions into the surrounding sedimentary basins. It has been propose d that the intrusions led to contact metamorphism in the host rock and expulsion of carbon-bearin g hydrothermal fluids through pipe-like vent complexes into the young ocean basin and from ther e onward into the atmosphere.  

During Expedition 396, we successfully recovered $240\,\mathrm{m}$ of sediments of PETM age from eight boreholes in vent structures and their immediate vicinity in the southern Vøring Basin (Figure F8). Thes e cores will allow us to test the hypothesis by biostratigraphic, sedimentological, and geochemica l analyses along with integration of wireline logs and high-resolution 3-D seismic data. A total of 195 5 m of Paleocene and Eocene age sedimentary rocks were drilled during Expedition 396, with a recovery of $1125\,\mathrm{m}\,(58\%)$ (Table T6). These cores represent a comprehensive archive of the environmenta l changes that took place from the onset of the EECO through the PETM and into the Middle and Lat e Eocene. The proxy data derived from the postcruise analyses will provide insights into the variou s drivers and responses in the earth system during these times of a global hothouse climate and subsequent cooling.  

# 6.2. Secondary objectives  

The comprehensive Expedition 396 database will also be used to study the opening of the nort h Atlantic seaways, the onset of ocean circulation patterns, and the occurrence of freshwater incursions into the young ocean basins. We have encountered the remains of the freshwater fern Azolla spp. in several of the expedition boreholes, and further analyses will provide a crucial documentation between its massive occurrence in the Arctic Ocean, Norwegian Greenland Sea, and Nort h Sea areas and sites in the Labrador Sea on the east coast of North America.

Finally, the recovered $587~\mathrm{m}$ of various basaltic facies units will be invaluable to achieve the othe r secondary objective, namely, the study of the suitability of the breakup basalt successions for th e permanent storage of $C O_{2}$ . Some of the recovered basalts are very vesicular, providing large reaction surfaces that make them potential reservoir rocks for permanent carbon storage. Detaile d analyses and integration with geophysical data will allow us to extrapolate these findings in thre e dimensions and form the basis for a robust assessment of the storage potential.
