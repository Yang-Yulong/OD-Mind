# Abstract  

The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) is a critical part of the global thermohaline conveyor. It plays a key role in transporting heat from the equatorial Pacific (the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool) to the Indian Ocean and exerts a major control on global climate. The complex tectonic history of the Indonesian archipelago, a result of continued northward motion and impingement of the Australasian plate into the southeast Asian part of the Eurasian plate, makes it difficult to reconstruct long-term (i.e., million year) ITF history from sites within the archipelago. The best areas to investigate ITF history are downstream in the Indian Ocean, either in the deep ocean away from strong tectonic deformation or along proximal passive margins that are directly under the influence of the ITF. Although previous Ocean Drilling Program and Deep Sea Drilling Project deepwater cores recovered in the Indian Ocean have been used to chart Indo-Pacific Warm Pool influence and, by proxy, ITF variability, these sections lack direct biogeographic and sedimentological evidence of the ITF. International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 356 cored seven sites covering a latitudinal range of ${29^{\circ}}\mathrm{S}{-}18^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ off the northwest coast of Australia to obtain a 5 My record of the ITF, Indo-Pacific Warm Pool, and climate evolution that has the potential to match orbital-scale deep-sea records in its resolution. The material recovered will allow us to describe the history of the Australian monsoon and its variability, a system whose genesis is thought to be related to the initiation of the East Asian monsoon and is hypothesized to have been in place since the Pliocene or earlier. It also will lead to a better understanding of the nature and timing of the development of aridity on the Australian continent.  

Detailed paleobathymetric and stratigraphic data from the transect will also allow subsidence curves to be constructed to constrain the spatial and temporal patterns of vertical motions caused by the interaction between plate motion and convection within the Earth’s mantle, known as dynamic topography. The northwest shelf is an ideal location to study this phenomenon because it is positioned on the fastest moving continent since the Eocene, on the edge of the degree 2 geoid anomaly. Accurate subsidence analyses over $10^{\circ}$ of latitude can resolve whether northern Australia is moving with or over either a time-transient or long-term stationary downwelling within the mantle, thereby vastly improving our understanding of deep-Earth dynamics and their impact on surficial processes.  

# Introduction  

During the past 5 My, Earth’s climate has experienced a major transition from mid-Pliocene warmth to Late Pleistocene ice ages (Rohling et al., 2014). Although we now have increasing numbers of high-resolution records of climate variability from ocean basins in both high-latitude and equatorial regions (McClymont et al., 2013), high-resolution information for the northwestern region of Australia and from other shelfal areas worldwide is rare. The wedge of sediment that has accumulated over the last 5 My on the northwest shelf (NWS) of Australia epitomizes the geological history of Australia’s northern margin (Figure F1). The section is made up of a variety of sediment types including subtropical to tropical shelf calcarenite, calcilutite, marl, and deep-water calcareous mudstone and siltstone eroded by submarine canyons (Wallace et al., 2003). In combination, these sediments make up a prograding shelf-type system typical of much of the Australian continental margin (Wallace et al., 2002).

The foci of International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 356 fell under the following three main headings.  

# Indonesian Throughflow, Leeuwin Current, and reef development  

During the late Neogene, the NWS has acted as a subsiding platform upon which most contemporary environmental changes ar e recorded. Located at the fringes of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool, thi s margin is therefore an ideal region in which to study tropical oceanography (Rosleff-Soerensen et al., 2012) and the history of the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF). The ITF also helps drive the Leeuwi n Current, which is the only southward-flowing eastern boundar y current in the Southern Hemisphere (Cresswell, 1991; Pearce, 2009). This current extended tropical reef development to $29^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ during the Late Pleistocene (Collins et al., 2006). The orbital-scal e variability of the Leeuwin Current can be estimated using tropica l sedimentary (coral reefs and ooids) and fossil biogeographic indexe s (Gallagher et al., 2009, 2014b, 2015), so we can determine by prox y the underlying controls that triggered Pliocene–Pleistocene reef development. Coring a latitudinal transect from $29^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ to $18^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ provide s essential information as to whether the switch to tropical sedimentation was synchronous or diachronous in this region as well as  a long-term perspective on how coral reefs in the east Indian Ocea n developed through variable climatic conditions.  

# Australian monsoon and continental aridity  

The continental shelf in this region lies directly offshore th e semi-arid Australian continent climatically dominated by the Australian monsoon (Suppiah, 1992). Shelf/slope sediments therefor e host a vast but barely explored archive of late Neogene climate variability (van der Kaars and De Deckker, 2002). Expedition 356 result s will increase our understanding of the long-term geographic controls on Australian monsoonal variability and its relationship to th e onset of aridity in Australia (McLaren et al., 2014).  

# Subsidence and geodynamics of the Australian plate  

Obtaining high-resolution stratigraphic data from the NWS wil l lead to improved burial and subsidence estimates for this region. These data will enable us to decipher the contribution of large-scal e geodynamic processes, such as dynamic topography, on the vertical motions of the Earth’s surface and associated effects on the NW S sedimentary system (Czarnota et al., 2013).  

# Background Tectonic setting  

The NWS is a rifted margin that has existed since late Paleozoi c time, when Australia was part of eastern Gondwana (Etheridge an d O’Brien 1994; Exon and Colwell, 1994; Longley et al., 2002). Ribbon-like microcontinents separated from this part of the margin i n multiple rifting events, with the latest phase of rifting occurring i n the Late Jurassic (Heine and Müller, 2005; Exon and Colwell, 1994; Metcalfe, 1988).  

IODP Sites U1458–U1460 are in the northern part of the Pert h Basin (Figure F1). The remaining sites (U1461–U1464) lie in th e Northern Carnarvon Basin (NCB) and Roebuck Basin on the NW S proper with an $8\;\mathrm{km}$ minimum stratigraphic thickness (Longley e t al., 2002; Goncharov, 2004). Here, the earliest rifting occurre d during the late Permian (initial breakup of eastern Gondwana; Sengor, 1987). Subsequent rifting episodes occurred during the Lat e Triassic–Early Jurassic and Late Jurassic (von Rad, Haq, et al., 1992; Driscoll and Karner, 1998) with the final rifting in the latest Jurassi c also culminating in earliest Cretaceous separation of greater Indi a from Australia (Boote and Kirk, 1989; von Rad, Haq, et al., 1992; Heine and Müller, 2005). The postrift thermal subsidence history o f the margin has been affected by mild shortening, generally attributed to plate boundary forces resulting from plate reorganization (Romine et al., 1997; Driscoll and Karner, 1998; Sayers et al., 2001; Cathro et al., 2003; Dyksterhuis et al., 2005). The most recen t major nearby tectonic event was the late Miocene collision betwee n northern Australia and the Banda arc (Audley-Charles et al., 1988; Lee and Lawver, 1995; Richardson and Blundell, 1996). Althoug h occurring several hundred kilometers to the north of the drillin g area, intraplate stresses associated with this ongoing collision hav e resulted in localized reactivation and inversion of extensional fault s in the NCB (Malcolm et al., 1991; Struckmeyer et al., 1998; Cathr o et al., 2003).  

# Dynamic topographic setting  

Since the breakup and dispersal of eastern Gondwana durin g the Cretaceous, the Australian plate has moved several thousand kilometers northward (Figure F2) and recorded anomalous floodin g patterns that cannot be reconciled with known eustatic variation s

(Figure F3) (Russell and Gurnis 1994; Gurnis et al., 1998; Veevers, 2000; DiCaprio et al., 2009; Heine et al., 2010). Lateral displacements of continents relative to mantle convection patterns have significant impact on the flooding history of continental platforms an d margins (Sleep, 1976; Gurnis, 1990, 1993; Russell and Gurnis, 1994).  

Eustatic curves constructed from data from a single margin ar e known to misrepresent actual global sea levels because of the influence of dynamic topography (Müller et al., $2008\boldsymbol{\mathrm{b}}$ ; Spasojević et al., 2008; Moucha et al., 2008). Apart from these continental-scale observations, measurements of the amplitude, wavelength, and rate o f dynamic topography resulting from circulation within the convecting mantle are rare. Subsidence anomalies along the NWS are ideal targets for the investigation of dynamic topography because the region lies across the gradient of the degree 2 geoid anomaly and o n the fastest moving continent since the Eocene (about ${>}35$ Ma). These subsidence anomalies have long been known (Müller et al., 2000; Kennard et al., 2003) and can be ascribed to dynamic topography because both thermal subsidence and flexural effects are minimal (Czarnota et al., 2013).  

Advancements in computer modeling (DiCaprio et al., 2011 ) have attributed subsidence anomalies along the NWS to dynami c drawdown of the Earth’s surface driven by Australia’s rapid northward motion over a generally stationary accumulation of subducte d slabs within the mantle beneath southeast Asia (e.g., Lithgow-Bertelloni and Gurnis, 1997; Heine et al., 2010). These models predic t that the NWS should be affected by a southward-propagating wav e of subsidence related to Australia’s northward motion over this stationary cold and dense mantle anomaly. Because Australia’s northward motion is ${\sim}70\,\mathrm{km/My}$ and the drilled sites span $10^{\circ}$ of latitude, this model predicts a resolvable subsidence diachroneity of ${>}10$ M y between the northernmost and southernmost sites.  

In contrast to the diachronous results suggested by geodynami c modeling, recent backstripping of NWS clinoform rollover positions indicates that margin-wide anomalous subsidence was instea d broadly synchronous and commenced at ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{Ma}$ with a down-tothe-north gradient equal in amplitude to adjacent oceanic floor residual depth anomalies (Czarnota et al., 2013). These data sugges t that the mantle anomaly responsible for this subsidence may b e transient and coupled to the plate motion. However, there is a lac k of temporal resolution between 0 and 5 Ma because there are n o well-defined clinoform rollovers.  

# Oceanographic and paleoceanographic setting  

The Indo-Pacific Warm Pool is a region of warm surface water s (average temperature $=28^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ) that covers most of the tropical western Pacific and eastern Indian Oceans (Figure F4). The Indo-Pacifi c Warm Pool plays a major role in heat transport from low to hig h latitudes and is subject to decadal-scale variability due to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (de Garidel-Thoron et al., 2005). The intensity of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool functions as a switch in th e climate system, and it is consequently a key influence on long- an d short-term global climate change ( ${\mathrm{\DeltaXu}}$ et al., 2006). Therefore, th e history of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool is crucial to our understanding of the global climatic and oceanic systems, as well as their regional effects on the NWS.  

Climatic cooling since $15\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and an evolving tectonic configuration created appropriate boundary conditions to generate “nearmodern” oceanic conditions in the Indo-Pacific. The Indo-Pacifi c Warm Pool (Figure F4) is trapped by the Indonesian archipelag o and released into the Indian Ocean via the ITF (Gordon, 2005). Th e ITF transports 10–15 Sverdrups $(1~\mathrm{Sv}\,=\,10^{6}~\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{s})$ ) of low-salinit y warm water via the Indonesian archipelago (Kuhnt et al., 2004) t o the Indian Ocean, forming an important switching point in th e global thermohaline conveyor. The ITF cannot be considered i n terms of an “open” or “closed” gateway but instead as the interactio n between (1) the source of the water (south versus north Pacific),

(2) the location of the main outlet, and (3) variable sill depths an d locations through time (Kuhnt et al., 2004). The current easter n (main) outlet through the Timor Sea probably originated around $2-$ $2.5\,\mathrm{\:Ma}$ . Until then, the Bali-Lombok Strait was more importan t (Kuhnt et al., 2004; Hall, 2009). The early history of the Indo-Pacifi c Warm Pool in the Indo-Pacific region has been interpreted fro m planktonic microfossils. Kennett et al. (1985) suggested that th e Indo-Pacific Warm Pool formed as a result of Indonesian Seawa y closure at ${\sim}8\,\mathrm{\:Ma}$ . In contrast, Srinivasan and Sinha (1998) use d planktonic foraminiferal biogeography to suggest its formation a t ${\sim}5.2\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Jian et al. (2006) suggested a late Miocene $\langle{\sim}10\,\mathrm{Ma}\rangle$ IndoPacific Warm Pool with the “modern” warm pool developing at ${\sim}4$ Ma. Karas et al. (2011) used comparisons between the $\mathrm{Mg/Ca}$ an d stable isotope data from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Holes 709 C and 763A on the western and eastern sides of the Indian Ocean, respectively (Figure F1), to suggest ITF restriction from 3.5 to $3\ \mathrm{Ma}$ that caused $3^{\circ}C$ cooling in those regions (Figure F5).  

The extratropical shelf regions of the Indo-Pacific are strongl y influenced by shallow $(50{-}300\,\mathrm{~m~})$ currents that originate in th e Indo-Pacific Warm Pool region. For example, the NWS oceanography from $5^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ to $15^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ is dominated by the South Equatorial Curren t (Collins, 2002) (Figure F4). South of $15^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , the shallow and narro w Leeuwin Current $^{<100\ \mathrm{km}}$ wide, ${<}300\mathrm{~m~}$ deep) transports warm, low-salinity, nutrient-deficient water southward along the wes t coast of Australia (Pattiaratchi, 2006). It is driven by longshor e winds and an upper-ocean pressure gradient (upper $250{-}300\ \mathrm{m})$ (Tomczak and Godfrey, 1994) that overcomes equatorward win d stress and upwelling to flow south (Pattiaratchi, 2006). Anothe r driver for this current is the steric height difference between th e low-density and -salinity Timor Sea and the cooler, denser, salin e

waters off the coast of Perth. It is the only south-flowing easter n boundary current in the Southern Hemisphere and has an enormous effect on the climate of the region. The Leeuwin Current extends modern coral reef development to $29^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (the HoutmanAbrolhos Reefs, Figure F1) (Collins et al., 1993) and the tropical– subtropical transition as far south as Rottnest Island $(33^{\circ}\mathrm{S};$ ; Greenstein and Pandolfi, 2008). Although the Late Pleistocene record an d modern oceanography of the Leeuwin Current are well understoo d (see Cresswell, 1991; Pearce, 2009, and references therein), the preLate Pleistocene history of this current is not well known (Kendric k et al., 1991; Wyrwoll et al., 2009). James et al. (1999) suggested tha t the Leeuwin Current ceased during glacial periods and restarte d during interglacials. Kendrick et al. (1991) used fossil mollusks t o suggest that onset of the Leeuwin Current occurred more recentl y than $500\;\mathrm{ka}$ , whereas Sinha et al. (2006) and Karas et al. (2011) suggested onset at $2.5\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , and McGowran et al. (1997) proposed a lat e Eocene $\left(40\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ onset age. However, Gallagher et al. (2009; 2014b ) used microfossil biogeographic indicators in subsurface petroleu m well samples from the NWS to suggest that the “modern” Leeuwi n Current is younger than $1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Spooner et al. (2011) documente d 500 ky of Leeuwin Current variability from a deep-sea cor e (MD002361, $1805~\mathrm{m}$ water depth) (Figure F1) using stable isotope s and planktonic foraminiferal proxies and suggested a weaker Leeuwin Current during glacial periods, when the West Australian Current was dominant, and a stronger Leeuwin Current durin g interglacials, especially marine isotope Stage (MIS) 11. The southerly migration of Indo-Pacific mollusks and corals to southwes t Australia has also been used to document the Late Pleistocene history of the Leeuwin Current (Kendrick et al., 1991; Greenstein an d Pandolfi, 2008).  

The distribution and timing of coral reef development in wes t Australia is intimately related to the Leeuwin Current (Kendrick e t al., 1991). Collins (2002) summarized late Neogene reef distributio n in northwest Australia by describing a series of late Tertiary reef s that have developed discontinuously over time. The late Quaternar y stratigraphic evolution of Scott Reef $(14^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ , Rowley Shoals (17.3°S), and Ningaloo $(22.7^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ and Houtman-Abrolhos $(28^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ Reefs (Figur e F1) is related to a combination of increased subsidence amplitud e toward the north, variability in the Leeuwin Current, and sea leve l change (Collins and Testa, 2010). Earlier reef development is les s well constrained. Ryan et al. (2009) described a series of structurall y controlled Miocene reefs from $15^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ to $18^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ using seismic data. These interpreted reefs drowned at the end of the late Miocen e (Messinian) when they failed to keep up with sea level change. Further south $(22^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ , Cathro et al. (2003) interpreted possible Miocen e “barrier” reefs or mounds in seismic data. Liu et al. (2011) also interpreted possible Miocene reefs based on seismically imaged mound s in the same area. Ryan et al. (2009) acknowledged the dearth o f post-Miocene and pre-late Quaternary reefs in the region. However, Jones (1973) and Ryan et al. (2009) described an unnamed postMiocene drowned “fossil” reef imaged using shallow- and deeppenetration seismic data close to the Rowley Shoals (Figure F1). Another series of drowned fossil reefs are shown in seismic data fro m $20^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ to $22^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (Gallagher et al., 2014b).  

# Climate and paleoclimate setting  

The arid to semiarid conditions of the Australian interior exten d to the west coast of Australia. In the north, rainfall is erratic but predominantly monsoonal (Figure F4) with the summer rainfall dominance declining sharply toward the south (Sturman and Tapper, 2005). Warm, moist, equatorial air is the major source of monsoona l and cyclonic rain in the north but is replaced in the south by tropical air from the Indian Ocean, which is also known as the “pseudomonsoon” (Gentilli, 1972). The Australian summer monsoo n delivers substantial precipitation to the northern part of the continent (north of $25^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ ) from December to March (Suppiah, 1992; Herold et al., 2011). The winds blow predominantly from the northwes t in the rainy season (austral summer), whereas in the dry seaso n (austral winter) the winds blow from the southeast. These change s are associated with the seasonal migration of the subtropical highpressure belt from $40^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ to $30^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ . In the austral winter, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is north of Indonesia and move s south in austral summer to a position immediately north of Australia (Figure F4). The ITCZ moves even farther south over tropica l Australia in February and is associated with the peak of the northern Australian wet season (Williams et al., 2009). The Australia n monsoon is thought to be caused by land-ocean temperature contrasts and interhemispheric flow from the Asian monsoon. Australian monsoon strength and timing is influenced by changes i n insolation resulting from obliquity and precessional forcing (Wyrwoll et al., 2007, 2012). The Australian summer monsoon lacks th e topographic influence that controls the Indian–East Asian summe r monsoon and is therefore weaker and more sensitive to variations i n insolation (Wyrwoll et al., 2007). The region affected by the Asia n and Australian monsoon systems $70^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ to $150^{\circ}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{,}}$ ) is one of the mos t significant heat sources driving global climate.  

# The paleomonsoon  

An (2000) speculated that the histories of the East Asian an d Australian monsoons are linked and that they originated before  7 Ma. Bowman et al. (2010) suggested (in the absence of any definitiv e northern Australia pre-Quaternary records) that “the (Australian ) monsoon is of great antiquity” because of the pronounced diversit y and strong adaptations of biota to the wet-dry tropical climate a s well as their strong general adaptability. Herold et al. (2011) note d the incomplete knowledge of the nature and intensity of the preQuaternary Australian monsoon and investigated its potential impact on rainfall levels in the Miocene using a general circulatio n model constrained with a vegetation model. Herold et al. (2011) an d Greenwood et al. (2012) compiled available paleontological prox y data for the Miocene and reconstructed a seasonally wet norther n and interior Australia, supporting a biome (i.e., seasonally dry deciduous vine forests and sclerophyllous woodlands) consistent wit h a monsoonal precipitation regime wetter than today. The only pollen record from the semiarid northwest Australian continent is wes t of the Cape Range Peninsula (Core GC17) (Figure F1) and spans th e last $100~\mathrm{ky}$ (van der Kaars and De Deckker, 2002; van der Kaars e t al., 2006). This location is at the southern extremity of the Australian summer monsoon and receives $200{-}300\,\mathrm{~mm}$ of rainfall pe r year, making it ideal to record changes in the latitudinal position o f the monsoon (Figure F4). Van der Kaars et al. (2006) used transfe r functions to interpret rainfall from the pollen record and hypothesized that a marked reduction in summer rainfall occurred in th e absence of monsoonal activity during the Last Glacial Maximum. Other deep-water Quaternary records of the Australian monsoo n have been obtained from farther north in the Timor Sea ( $13^{\circ}\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{\m}}$ , Holbourn et al., 2005) and in the Banda Sea $\mathrm{^{5}S},$ , Beaufort et al., 2010; $8.5^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , Spooner et al., 2005). Holbourn et al. (2005) used foraminiferal and geochemical proxies to chart Timor Sea paleoproductivit y over the last $350~\mathrm{ky}$ and noted that the Timor Sea productivity record matches the $25^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ summer insolation curve, which they interpreted to have strong precessional and eccentricity control. Thi s observation indicates that tropical and/or Southern Hemisphere insolation forcing is an important modulating factor for Australia n monsoon intensity. Spooner et al. (2005) combined stable isotop e analyses with planktonic foraminiferal assemblages to interpret th e 80 ky variability of the monsoon and concluded that it was less intense during the first $60\,\mathrm{ky}$ then intensified at $\mathord{\sim}15\,\mathrm{ka}$ . Beaufort et al. (2010) used calcareous nannofossils to suggest precessional control on primary productivity and Australian monsoon intensity over th e last $150\ \mathrm{ky}$ . The Australian monsoon is interpreted to be broadl y controlled by global glacial–interglacial variations (Wyrwoll an d Miller, 2001). Strong variations in Australian monsoonal strengt h between glacial and interglacial periods (paced by orbital eccentricity and precession) have been documented over the last $460~\mathrm{ky}$ of f northwest Australia (Kawamura et al., 2006) with stronger monsoonal (wet) conditions prevailing during interglacial periods and  a weakened monsoon (dry) during glacials. This pattern of glacial–interglacial precipitation variance was further suggested in a $550~\mathrm{ky}$ dust record from offshore North West Cape (Stuut et al., 2014). Significant fluvial runoff and megalake expansion across northern an d central Australia (Hesse et al., 2004) occurred during interglacial s over the last 300 ky because of Australian monsoon enhancement. Conversely, reduced precipitation on the NWS (at $23^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , van de r Kaars et al., 2006) and megalake contraction typified glacial conditions (Magee et al., 2004), associated with decreased monsoonal activity.  

Little is known about the timing of the development of the characteristic synoptic-scale division of Australia into a winter-we t south and summer-wet north. At a first approximation, the intensit y and timing of monsoonal northern Australia and frontal-dominate d southern Australia are both controlled by the intensity and seasonal migration of the subtropical anticyclone. Hence, the history of th e southern subtropical anticyclone may be critical to our understanding of the evolution of synoptic systems at both ends of the continent. However, it is unknown whether the late Neogene evolution o f the Australian monsoon was synchronized with contemporaneou s climatic evolution in the southern part of the continent. Nevertheless, the timing of patterns seen in the gamma radiation maxima o f the NWS (Figure F6) shows similarities with data from southeastern Australia. For example, fossil insect and pollen analyses from  a small upland paleolake in southeastern Australia indicate that hig h annual and summer rainfall persisted there until at least $1.5\,\mathrm{\:Ma}$ (Sniderman et al., 2009, 2013), which is inconsistent with the modern climate and vegetation patterns. Drying of a megalake in what i s now the semiarid interior of southeastern Australia did not occu r until the early Pleistocene ( $1.5–1.4\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ; McLaren and Wallace, 2010; McLaren et al., 2011, 2012, 2014). In central Australia, there is evidence that the final phase of aridification, marked by the presence o f active dune fields, did not initiate until ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Fujioka and Chappell, 2010). Hence, it is possible that the onset of modern patterns o f rainfall seasonality across the continent, as well as the initiation o f full aridity in inland Australia, were synchronized. Further insigh t into the relative input from precipitation can be obtained by analyzing the clay mineralogy of the marly facies (Gingele et al., 2001a, 2001b). The percent kaolinite/illite/chlorite content in each horizo n will vary depending on the relative intensity of precipitation an d runoff from the source coastal hinterland. For example, reduce d chlorite associated with a decrease in kaolinite is interpreted to indicate arid conditions on the NWS during the Holocene (Gingele e t al., 2001b). In addition, geochemical analyses of dust in NWS sediments have been used as a relative aridity index (Stuut et al., 2014).  

Turney et al. (2006) suggested that late Quaternary climatic variability across northern Australia probably reflected changes in th e latitude of the ITCZ, the westerlies, and ocean masses. However, these authors stated that “few local records are available that enabl e the frequency, timing, and latitudinal span to be reconstructed wit h great confidence.” They note that biological or geomorphic prox y evidence might often show a time-transgressive response to climatic variability. They concluded with a plea to perform quantitative reconstructions of past climates in this region with a refine d chronology. Biodiversity studies emphasize the uniqueness of th e Australian monsoon biota (Crisp and Cook, 2013; Oliver et al., 2014) as it evolved in response to the changing monsoon and increased aridity in the Neogene.  

# Sedimentation history  

The northward drift of Australia led to a transition from siliciclastic to predominantly carbonate deposition on the NWS. Carbonate  sedimentation  was  already  dominant  by  the  Eocene, although a siliciclastic component persisted (Hull and Griffiths, 2002). This drift brought the NWS into tropical latitudes (Veever s et al., 1991; Müller et al., 2008a); the region had reached $36^{\circ}\mathrm{S}{-}40^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ by the early Oligocene and is now at $18^{\circ}\mathrm{S}{-}22^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (Figure F2). Prograding carbonate clinoforms developed in the early Oligocene an d continued to the Miocene (Hull and Griffiths, 2002; Cathro et al., 2003). Late early Oligocene–early late Miocene carbonate sedi

ments are heterozoan (i.e., derived from light-independent organisms) and include benthic foraminifers with subordinate bryozoan s and rare coral fragments (Cathro et al., 2003). Such sediments develop unrimmed platforms lacking reefs. Resulting clinoformal sequences comprise fine-grained calcilutites on the slope, a mixture o f calcisiltites and calcarenites near clinoform rollovers (equivalent t o paleoshelf edges), and calcarenites on paleoshelves (Hull and Griffiths, 2002; Moss et al., 2004). Evidence for pre-Quaternary reef development is limited; seismically identified reefs or reef mound s occur in the Oligocene–Miocene section (Romine et al., 1997; Cathro et al., 2003; Ryan et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2011). Rare reefs als o occur in the Pliocene–Quaternary section (Ryan et al., 2009; Gallagher et al., 2014b), and conditions were favorable for late Quaternary reef development even farther south to $28^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (Collins, 2002). However, sedimentation rates, even in temperate water carbonates, can be high $(>\!40\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ , comparable to the lower end of the spectrum of tropical carbonate platform growth rates (James and Bone, 1991).  

# Previous drilling in the region  

The NWS has been extensively drilled by industry over the las t $40\,\mathrm{{y}}$ (Longley et al., 2002). Previous work by both academia and industry on the NWS has provided abundant site data, including wel l completion reports, seismic data, wireline logs, cuttings, (rare) sidewall cores, and limited engineering cores in the latest Quaternar y sections. However, cores that sampled the upper kilometer (Miocene to Holocene carbonate section) are extremely rare. The onl y continuous cores that existed prior to Expedition 356 were from engineering boreholes, typically sampling Late Pleistocene carbonate s in the upper $\mathord{\sim}150\mathrm{~m~}$ (Figure F7), and intermittent sidewall core s (Figure F5). There are industry wells near each of the Expeditio n 356 sites; these wells provided data in the form of gamma wirelin e logs (mostly to the seabed; Figure F6) and cuttings samples. Additionally, there are two continuously cored engineering borehole s (BHC4 and BHC1) near the Angel-1 Well $\left(19.5^{\circ}\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{i}}\right.$ ; Figures F1, F7 ) (Gallagher et al., 2014b). Facies data $(\%{\mathrm{CaCO}}_{3})$ from these engineering boreholes are directly comparable to the LR2004 oxyge n isotope record (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005). For example, the lowe r carbonate marly facies (with relatively high gamma response) wer e deposited during interglacial highstands, and the high-carbonat e calcarenites (with ooids) were deposited as the sea level fell durin g glacials. It is likely that the presence of increased siliciclastic s (gamma peaks) on the NWS is related to increased precipitatio n and terrestrial runoff during the interglacial periods from an enhanced Australian monsoon. The decrease in terrestrial inpu t during glacials was due to increasingly arid conditions, starving th e shelf of siliciclastics (Gallagher et al., 2014b). This sedimentatio n model is likely applicable throughout the Pliocene–Pleistocene shelfal carbonate section (Figure F6) because regional subsidence ha s likely facilitated the preservation of the majority of the eccentricity/obliquity-controlled eustatic cycles throughout this period (Gallagher et al., 2014b).  

In addition, the gamma log pattern clearly changes throug h time: Pliocene strata are more gamma rich and there is a secula r shift to lower values during the Pleistocene (Figure F6). This coul d reflect progressive changes in shelf geometry; however, this effec t can be corrected for using paleobathymetric estimates in each section. Furthermore, the prevalence of this upward decreasing gamm a pattern across $10^{\circ}$ of latitude suggests a more regional mechanism, such as an increase of aridity through time and decreasing influenc e of the Australian monsoon. The shelfal sections also yield well-preserved Globigerinoides ruber and Cibicidoides spp. (plus many othe r benthic foraminiferal species) in the interglacial marly facies. Th e G. ruber and Cibicidoides spp. exhibit isotope values close to deepsea Pleistocene values in the region (Wells and Wells, 1994), providing an opportunity to use proxy data for salinity and temperatur e variations (such as paired $\mathrm{Mg/Ca}$ and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ analyses) for each glacia l cycle to investigate the influence of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool an d ITF on the region and their relationship to the Leeuwin Current.

# Chronostratigraphic framework  

A wealth of information was already available on the chronostratigraphic framework in the region, and this information wa s particularly useful as background for the expedition.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Planktonic foraminifers and nannofossils are common in NW S shelfal sections, especially the highstand and outer shelf to uppe r slope facies, but they are absent in the oolitic facies and poorly preserved in the coarse calcarenites. They are abundant in all the facie s of the West Tryal Rocks-1 Well (near Site U1461; Figure F8; see dat a and zonation in Gallagher et al., 2009). There are also a few usefu l dinoflagellate datums (McMinn, 1992, 2002) in the Pliocene–Pleistocene section to assist age calibration.  

# Magnetostratigraphy  

Typically, this technique is used to provide a chronostratigraph y for deep-water siliciclastics or carbonates. However, Sakai and Jig e (2006) successfully demonstrated that magnetostratigraphy is als o useful in calibrating Pleistocene shallow-water tropical carbonate s in the Ryukyus (Japan).  

# Correlation to oxygen isotope curves  

With a few biostratigraphic calibration points, it is possible t o correlate log gamma maxima to interglacial cycles (Gallagher et al.,  

2014b), similar to the approach adopted by Carter and Gammo n (2004). These authors correlated the gamma profile from ODP Sit e 1119 to oxygen isotope data to achieve a millennial-scale record o f New Zealand upper slope sedimentation for the last $3.9~\mathrm{My}$ . Thi s type of wireline analysis has also revealed Pliocene–Pleistocene 4 0 ky-scale climate variability in the Japan Sea (deMenocal et al., 1992).  

# Carbon isotope dating  

There are sufficiently well preserved mollusks in the upper part s of the sections to permit carbon isotope dating. This technique ha s already been applied successfully near the top of Core BHC4 (Figur e F7).  

# Strontium isotope dating  

With thorough petrographic screening for diagenetic effects , such as subaerial exposure, it is possible to use strontium isotope s from bioclasts to construct age-depth profiles. Ehrenberg et al. (2006) have successfully dated calcitic bioclasts, such as bivalves, red algae, and large benthic foraminifers (LBFs), from Miocene platform carbonates.  

# Operations strategy  

The operational strategy for Expedition 356 is described in detail in the Scientific Prospectus (Gallagher et al., 2014a). In brief, Expedition 356 site locations were designed to sample the lateral variability (over $10^{\circ}$ ) in subsidence and tropical conditions along th e NWS over the last 5 My (Figure F1), specifically targeting tropical reef and carbonate diachroneity, related to Leeuwin Current inten

sity and ITF/Indo-Pacific Warm Pool influence, together with investigation of subsidence history and dynamic topography.  

Expedition 356 Sites U1458 (proposed Site NWS-6A), U146 0 (proposed Site NWS-5A), U1461 (proposed Site NWS-4A), U146 2 (proposed Site NWS-3A), and U1463 (proposed Site NWS-2A) ar e located within $150\;\mathrm{m}$ of preexisting industry wells (Table T1). Site s U1459 (proposed Site NWS-13A) and U1464 (proposed Site NWS7A) were originally alternate site locations near Sites U1458 an d proposed primary Site NWS-1A, respectively. These sites wer e cored when conditions were either unfavorable at the original site, as in the case of Site U1459, or when a review of the available seismic data on board the ship suggested the alternate site was mor e likely to achieve the science objectives (Site U1464).  

The original operations plan anticipated triple piston coring o f the upper sections at each site followed by deepening two of th e holes with coring via the extended core barrel (XCB) system. Two o f the deeper penetration sites (U1461 and U1462) were expected t o include coring with the rotary core barrel (RCB) system to reach th e target depth. The deepest penetration hole at all sites was planne d to include wireline logging. However, this operations plan was no t followed in some cases (see Operations in each site chapter for details) because the nature of the seafloor and the upper sediment s precluded piston coring. This was particularly true for the souther n sites (U1458 and U1459), where hard layers necessitated the use o f the XCB system at the seafloor (see Operations in the Site U145 8 chapter and Operations in the Site U1459 chapter [Gallagher et al., 2017b, 2017c]). Despite the challenges encountered during operations, excellent material was recovered to address the scientific objectives.  

# Principal results  

During Expedition 356, seven sites were cored over a latitudina l range from $29^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ to $18^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ on the NWS (Table T2). In total, we recovered $5185.15\;\mathrm{m}$ of core, with $62\%$ recovery, and gathered an unparalleled  archive  of  tropical  to  warm  temperate  climate  an d paleoceanography along the continental margin of Australia. Postcruise research will provide further insights on the complex interrelationships between subsidence, reef development, ITF variability, the Australian monsoon, and the onset of aridity in Australia ove r the last 5 My.  

Sites U1459, U1461, and U1464 (Figure F1) have revealed insights into the timing and onset of reef development and are important because the pre-late Quaternary history of tropical ree f development on the NWS is poorly known. The shelfal sites provid e biogeographic evidence of ITF connectivity (Figure F5), yielding  a downstream record of this important ocean gateway. Sites U146 1 and U1462 yielded ooids of Pleistocene age. Knowing the temporal and spatial distribution of ooids on the NWS also provides insight s into regional aridity and Indian Ocean alkalinity, and these data ca n also be used as paleodepth indicators. The presence of bathymetrically diagnostic microfossil biofacies, such as larger and smaller benthic foraminifers, at each of the expedition’s sites should permi t construction of well-constrained subsidence histories across $10^{\circ}$ latitude, allowing the detailed temporal history of dynamic subsidenc e of the northern Australian plate to be constructed for the first time. All of the sites are likely to yield spores and pollen and therefor e provide a record of vegetation-type shifts that will improve our understanding of the timing and nature of monsoonal variability an d aridification in northwestern Australia. Compared to the eolian-derived floral assemblages from deep oceanic sites, material recovere d from the NWS, closer to the shoreline, contains predominantly fluvial-derived assemblages that contribute to a more realistic assessment of regional climate. In particular, shelfal to upper slope target s (Sites U1460–U1464) provide particularly important climate records. Sites U1461–U1464 were anticipated to provide insight int o the onset and dynamics of the Australian monsoon and its relationship to obliquity forcing. Cores from these sites represent an increase in our understanding of this important climate syste m because previous studies in the region focused only on the last 20 0 ky. Site U1460 was not expected to yield an orbital-scale climate record because of slope erosional processes; however, it may indee d yield an orbital-scale record and complements Sites U1461–U146 4 because it lies south of a climatic divide between the Australia n monsoon–dominated northern area and the westerly wind-driven, winter rainfall–dominated southern area (Figure F4). Site U146 0 therefore provides a Pliocene–Pleistocene record of onset and variability of the southern Australian winter rainfall–dominated regime.

# Site summaries Site U1458  

Site U1458 lies in the northern part of the Perth Basin, adjacen t to the Houtman-1 Well on the northern Rottnest shelf (James et al., 1999; Collins et al., 2014). The site is seaward of and downdip fro m the Houtman-Abrolhos main reef complex, which contains th e most southerly tropical reefs in the Indian Ocean. Site U1458 wa s the southernmost site of our latitudinal transect. The evolution o f this reef complex is directly related to the path of the Leeuwin Current. Dating of sediments cored at Site U1458, coupled with seismi c correlation, could provide insights into the pre-Quaternary histor y of these reefs and a long-term perspective on Leeuwin Current evolution at the tropical/subtropical boundary off Western Australia. In addition, it has been suggested that subsidence rates over the las t $140~\mathrm{ky}$ were low compared to those of the reefs of the Carnarvo n Basin (Collins and Testa, 2010), so subsidence analyses of the site’ s shelf sequence would extend this record and allow more precis e modeling of dynamic subsidence along the western margin of Australia.  

Unfortunately, we were unable to effectively core and recove r material at Site U1458, and the site was abandoned in favor of Sit e U1459, located ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{nmi}$ seaward of Site U1458 and in water ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m}$ deeper, where it was anticipated that a finer grained section woul d be encountered. As a result of the poor recovery and shallow penetration, paleomagnetic data were not produced at this site and n o discrete samples were taken. Downhole logging and stratigraphi c correlation were not attempted.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

Site U1458 yielded a total of $3.72\:\mathrm{m}$ of core. The material recovered in all cores was normally graded because of sorting of the sediment within the core liner during coring and recovery. The poo r recovery and potential reworking of sediments prevented the definition of lithostratigraphic units, so only the lithology was described.  

The core recovered from Hole U1458A suggests a hard seafloo r comprising a ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick lithified layer, with a soft-sediment cove r in the mudline sample. Sediment below the lithified layer is unlithified skeletal grain- to rudstone containing coarse rhodolith-bearin g gravel to fine-grained carbonate sand. Diverse macro- and microfossil assemblages found in diminishing order of abundance included rhodoliths, mollusk fragments, bryozoans, calcareous an d siliceous sponge spicules, and benthic and planktonic foraminifers. Smear slide analyses indicate that the rudstones are predominantl y skeletal fragments of mollusks and bryozoan colonies. The occurrence of well-rounded to ellipsoidal gravel to coarse sand sedimen t indicates moderate-energy currents in the area.  

# Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology  

Three core catchers (CC) were sampled from Cores 356- U1458A-1H, 2H, and 4F. Core 3X did not yield any core catcher material. In addition to foraminifers and nannofossils, bryozoans, ostracods, and pteropods are present. A mudline sample was als o taken from this site. Calcareous nannofossils were observed in cor e catchers from Cores 1H, 2H, and 4F and the mudline sample. Calcareous nannofossil abundance is very low and their preservation i s poor to good. The youngest biostratigraphic event in the mudlin e sample is based on the occurrence of Emiliania huxleyi. The estimated age is ${<}0.29\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , or Zone NN21. Section 1H-CC contains  a recent–Pleistocene assemblage with Neogene reticulofenestrid s that were likely reworked. From the base of Core 1H to the botto m of Hole U1458A ( $9.95\;\mathrm{m}$ core depth below seafloor [CSF-A]), gephyrocapsids are very common, with a dominance of Gephyrocaps a caribbeanica. Based on gephyrocapsids and $G.$ . caribbeanica in th e samples, the estimated age at total depth is younger than $1.73\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

The samples contain between $12\%$ and $66\%$ planktonic foraminifers, and preservation varies between poor and moderate. In Section  356-U1458A-2H-CC,  around $10\%$ of  specimens  wer e reworked. There is evidence of diagenesis and inorganic precipitation and/or recrystallization in Section 4F-CC. The overall diversit y is low, with around five or six different species in each sample. G. ruber (white), Globigerinoides conglobatus, Globigerinoides sacculifer (without sac), Globorotalia crassaformis, Globorotalia menardii, Globorotalia tosaensis, and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei ar e present. The top of $G.$ . tosaensis is reported to be at ${\sim}0.61$ Ma, according to Gradstein et al. (2012). The specimens of this species di d not appear to be reworked. Thus, unless they were transported fro m the slope, this marker species gives an age of ${\sim}0.61$ Ma for the bas e of Core 2H.  

The samples contain between $35\%$ and $88\%$ benthic foraminifers, dominated by Quinqueloculina lamarckiana and Amphistegina lessonii and abundant Cibicidoides spp. In each sample, 11–2 3 species were observed. Preservation is poor, and fragmentation varies from poor to very poor. Encrustation and heavy abrasion on test s impeded identification of some taxa to species level, indicating reworking. Section 356-U1458A-1H-CC contains warm-temperate, shallow-water foraminifers.  

# Geochemistry  

Three samples were analyzed for headspace gas content, all o f which showed very low subsurface methane $^{<2.5}$ parts per millio n by volume [ppmv]). Inorganic and organic carbon content and interstitial water (IW) geochemistry measurements were not conducted.  

# Physical properties  

Physical properties measurements at Site U1458 were collecte d using the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL), natural gamma radiation (NGR) sensor, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity caliper, and discrete sampling. Gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density averaged $1.33\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in Cores 356-U1458A-1H and 2H and $1.59\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ i n Core 4F. Average magnetic susceptibility (MS) was 0.66 SI, and tw o peaks were observed at depths of 1.1–1.4 and $9.5{-}9.7\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Low NGR counts and low GRA bulk density occur together an d correspond to the coarser rudstone and vice versa for the carbonat e sands. These trends may be due to lithological variations or to los s of water in the pore spaces of the coarser materials. $P$ -wave velocit y measurements were performed on the sandier portions of Core s 1H, $2\mathrm{H}$ , and 4F and fluctuated between 1500 and $1800~\mathrm{m/s}$ . Colo r reflectance was measured on the archive halves of split cores an d did not show any clear trends. One moisture and density (MAD ) sample was taken in each of Cores 1H, 2H, and 4F. MAD bulk densities had the same values as corresponding GRA bulk densities, an d MAD grain densities did not vary. Cores 1H and 2H have higher porosity $(\sim\!55\%)$ than Core 4F $(47\%)$ .  

Disturbance during drilling and coring resulted in sorting of th e materials. Generally, the material becomes coarser downcore. However, cemented rudstones occurred at the tops of the cores. Th e physical properties reflect these changes in sediment size. However, we do not believe that these variations have stratigraphic significance.  

# Site U1459  

Site U1459 lies in the northern part of the Perth Basin, about  1 nmi basinward of both Site U1458 and the Houtman-1 Well on th e northern Rottnest shelf (James et al., 1999; Collins et al., 2014). I t was originally intended as an alternate to Site U1458. The shi p moved to Site U1459 after having difficulty coring the uppermos t sediments at Site U1458 (see Operations in the Site U1458 chapte r [Gallagher et al., 2017b]). Like Site U1458, Site U1459 is seaward o f and downdip from the Houtman-Abrolhos main reef complex, which contains the most southerly tropical reefs in the India n  

Ocean. Sites U1458 and U1459 comprise the southernmost sites o f our latitudinal transect. The objectives for Site U1459 are the sam e as those for Site U1458. The evolution of the Houtman-Abrolho s reef complex is directly related to the path of the Leeuwin Current. Dating of sediments cored at Site U1459, coupled with seismic correlation, will provide insight into the pre-Quaternary history o f these reefs and a long-term perspective on Leeuwin Current evolution at the tropical/subtropical boundary off Western Australia. I n addition, it has been suggested that subsidence rates over $140~\mathrm{ky}$ were low compared to those of the Carnarvon Basin reefs (Collin s and Testa, 2010). Subsidence analyses of the shelf wedge drilled a t this site will extend this record and allow more precise modeling o f dynamic subsidence along the western margin of Australia. An additional objective was to use any finer grained facies in this sectio n to yield a Pliocene–Pleistocene record of the onset and variability o f the southern Australian winter-dominated rainfall regime.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The lithostratigraphic units and their boundaries at Site U145 9 (and all subsequent sites) are defined by changes in lithology (identified by visual core description and smear slide observations), physical properties, color reflectance $(\mathbf{L}^{*},\,\mathbf{a}^{*},$ , and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ ), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and petrographic thin section analyses. Site U1459 consists of seven lithostratigraphic units (Figure F9). The majo r lithologic differences between units are their texture, degree of lithification, fossil content, diagenetic features, and mineralogical components. Unit boundaries are defined based on the first occurrenc e of a new lithology downhole. The lithologic descriptions are base d primarily on sediments recovered from Hole U1459B for 0–233.0 2 m CSF-A (i.e., to the bottom of Hole U1459B), augmented with observations from Holes U1459A and U1459C. Descriptions for strat a deeper than $233.02\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ are from Hole U1459C. Seven lithostratigraphic units were defined:  

• Unit I (Hole $\mathrm{U1459A}=0{-}32.78\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF{-}A}$ and Hole $\mathrm{U}1459\mathrm{B}=$ $0{-}23.06\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A; lithified skeletal packstone to floatstone),   
• Unit II (Hole $\mathrm{U1459A}=32.78{-}42.93\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A and Hole $\mathrm{U1459B}=23.06{-}40.65\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ ; unlithified mudstone to packstone interbedded with skeletal grainstone),   
• Unit III (Hole $\mathrm{U1459A}=43.93\mathrm{-70.75~m~CSF-A}$ and Hole $\mathrm{U1459B}=40.65{-}95.60\;\mathrm{m}\;{\mathrm{CSF-A}};$ glauconitized unlithified to partially lithified packstone to grainstone with macrofossils),   
• Unit IV (Hole $\mathrm{U1459B}=95.60{-}139.20\;\mathrm{m}\;{\mathrm{CSF}}{-}$ A; unlithified homogeneous packstone with glauconite),   
• Unit V (Hole $\mathrm{U1459B}=139.20\mathrm{-233.02\,m\,CSF-}$ A and Hole $\mathrm{U1459C}=205.80{-}258.25\mathrm{~m~CSF}{-}$ A; dolomitic packstone with quartz and divided into two subunits): • Subunit Va (Hole $\mathrm{U1459B}=139.20{-}182.30\mathrm{~m~}0$ CSF-A; unlithified packstone that includes a partially to fully lithified interval) and • Subunit Vb (Hole $\mathrm{U1459B}=182.30{-}233.02\;\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{CSF-A}}$ and Hole $\mathrm{U1459C}=205.80{-}258.25\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{CSF}.$ A; unlithified packstone with dolomite interbedded with lithified fine quartz sand),   
• Unit VI (Hole $[1459\mathrm{C}=258.25-296.40\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ ; lithified beige to light brown/gray to brown dolostone), and   
• Unit VII (Hole $\mathrm{U1459C}=296.40{-}397.72\mathrm{\;m\;}$ CSF-A; lithified, chert-rich packstone and microcrystalline dark gray chert).  

# Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology  

Holes U1459A and U1459B contain Pleistocene to late Miocen e sediments, whereas the strata in Hole U1459C were determined t o be of Oligocene to early middle Eocene age. E. huxleyi is present i n Sample 356-U1459A-1F-CC, suggesting a Late Pleistocene to recen t age, whereas the top of Pseudoemiliania lacunosa (Zone NN19, older than $0.44\,\mathrm{Ma})$ is present in Holes U1459A (from Section 6F-2 ) and U1459B (Sample 5F-CC). The Pliocene/Pleistocene boundar y in Sample 356-U1459B-12F-CC ( $64.25\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) is marked by th e presence of Discoaster surculus $\left(>2.49\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ . The top of the late Miocene $(5.59\,\mathrm{\textbf{Ma}})$ was located by the presence of Discoaster neohamatus (33F-CC) and Discoaster quinqueramus (Sample 34F-CC ; $165.26\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) in Hole U1459B. Cores 46F and 47F are barren, but nannofossils in Core 48X indicate a middle Miocene age. Hol e U1459C (Cores 2R through 10R) contains typical assemblages o f early to late Miocene medium to large reticulofenestrids but no biostratigraphic markers. Deeper core catchers are barren of nannofossils or contain very rare Reticulofenestra haqii only. An earlies t Oligocene (or older) age $(>\!32.92\mathrm{\Ma})$ ) was inferred by the presenc e of Ericsonia formosa in Sample 19R-CC and Reticulofenestra umbilicus in Sample 20R-CC $293.14\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A). The presence of Cribrocentrum reticulatum in Sample 26R-CC $321.19\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) confirm s late Eocene age, and the bottom of Hole U1459C dates to the earl y middle Eocene based on the presence of Chiasmolithus grandis an d E. formosa and absence of R. umbilicus.  

The Pleistocene planktonic foraminifer Biozone Pt1a (0.61–1.9 3 Ma) is between Cores 356-U1459A-5F and 10F (51.47 m CSF-A). Deeper than Core 356-U1459B-16F $\left({\sim}83\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}\right)$ ), a Pliocene faunal assemblage is present (Biozone PL4), indicating an age of at leas t 3.47 Ma (top of Dentoglobigerina altispira). Below the Pliocene, severe dolomitization prevented preservation of age-diagnostic fauna. Beginning again with Core 356-U1459C-20R $293.14\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A), preservation improves and planktonic foraminifers are present, bu t overall preservation remains (very) poor. The first identifiable faunas indicate an Oligocene age. Deeper than Sample 29R-CC (335. 7 m CSF-A), a well-developed Eocene faunal assemblage is presen t and includes Subbotina gortanii, Subbotina eoceana, Globigerinatheka index, and Acarinina primitiva. These encompass Biozones E14–E9 $({\sim}38{-}50\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . The bottom of Hole U1459C dates t o the latest early Eocene (Biozone E7; first appearance datum of Acarinina bullbrooki and last appearance datum of Acarinina alticonica; ${\sim}50.2\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ).  

The analyzed samples contain between $15\%$ and $96\%$ benthi c foraminifers; Cibicides spp. and Cibicidoides spp. are the most common taxa. Four assemblages were defined by abundances of Textularia spp., Uvigerina spp., Bolivina spp., and epifaunal species:  

• The first assemblage (0–46.51 m CSF-A) contains a range of shallow-water and deeper water warm to temperate species, such as Q. lamarckiana, Heterolepa bradyi, and Textularia spp. Larger benthic foraminifers, such as A. lessonii and Amphistegina lobifera are present between Cores 356-U1459A-5X and 10F (22.5–51.47 m CSF-A).   
• The second assemblage $(78.39\mathrm{-}122.9\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSI}$ -A) is characterized by Uvigerina spp., particularly Uvigerina peregrina, Bolivina spp., and infaunal shallow-water $(50{-}150\;\mathrm{m})$ species.   
• The third assemblage $(165.26{-}238.85\;\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{CSF-A}})$ contains a lowdiversity fauna dominated by bolivinids.   
• The fourth assemblage $(287.11{-}387.68\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ is composed almost entirely of epifaunal species.  

In each sample, 1–41 species were observed. With the exception o f the two uppermost core catcher samples from Hole U1459A (1FCC and 2X-CC), the preservation of benthic foraminiferal tests i s

poor to very poor throughout Site U1459. Estimated paleobathymetry ranged from shallow/neritic environments $\left(\sim\!50\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ to ${>}500\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Other fossil groups present included ostracods, bryozoa, wor m casings, and pteropods.  

# Geochemistry  

At Site U1459, 63 samples were analyzed for headspace gas content, 20 samples for IW geochemistry, 24 samples for carbonate, and 20 samples for total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitroge n (TN). Because of the nature of the recovered material, includin g chert and other lithified sediments in Hole U1459C, geochemica l analyses were not performed except for carbonate and headspac e gas measurements, which were made when feasible. The site i s characterized by high percentages of calcium carbonate (mea n value $=88\mathrm{\wt\%}$ ) and low TOC (mean value $=0.53\mathrm{\wt\%}$ . Elevate d salinity also characterizes the site, with values $>\!37$ deeper than $45\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, reaching 50 in the interval from 120 to $195\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Overall, many of the geochemical parameters measured exhibit change s in trend or slope at ${\sim}68\mathrm{~m~CSF{-}A}$ , where Sr sharply decreases fro m $\mathord{\sim}300$ to $200\,\upmu\mathrm{M}_{:}$ , or ${\sim}120\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, where $\mathrm{Mg}$ and $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ both reac h maximum values of 65 and $40\;\mathrm{mM}$ , respectively.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1459 included routin e measurements and partial demagnetization of natural remanen t magnetization (NRM) of archive-half core sections and selecte d discrete samples from working-half sections. Rock magnetic experiments, including extended demagnetization sequences, were als o conducted on discrete samples. NRM intensity values from the archive half range from $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-5}\ \mathrm{A/m}$ after alternating field (AF ) demagnetization peak fields of 20 and $30\;\mathrm{mT}$ . Two distinct interval s emerged from the otherwise scattered directional data: (1) thre e peaks of negative magnetic inclination (corresponding to norma l polarity) and intensity values between $\mathord{\sim}130$ and $140\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ an d (2) a peak of positive magnetic inclination (reversed polarity) between 145 and $170\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Constraints from biostratigraphic datums suggest these features are older than $3.7\,\mathrm{~Ma~}$ and are thu s tentatively correlated with Subchrons C2Ar (3.596–4.187 Ma) an d C3n (C3n.1n [4.187–4.3 Ma], C3n.2n [4.493–4.631 Ma], and C3n.3 n [4.799–4.896]). Discrete sample results are generally comparable t o archive-half intensity and inclination values. Uncertainties associated with determining the characteristic paleomagnetic direction s and magnetic mineralogy are amplified by the pervasive diagenesi s throughout the sediments.  

# Physical properties  

Physical properties measurements were carried out using th e WRMSL, NGR sensor, $P$ -wave velocity caliper, and discrete sampling. Thermal conductivity was also measured in several section s and varied between 1.0 and $1.3\ \mathrm{W/(m\cdotK)}$ . Bulk density was determined using both GRA and MAD methods (see Physical properties in the Expedition 356 methods chapter [Gallagher et al., 2017a]). These two methods yielded consistent increases in densit y with depth to $160\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , below which it becomes variable. Th e increase may reflect increasing diagenesis and generation of dolomite from calcite. The MS of the recovered sediments is relativel y low, with most readings ranging between $-2$ and 4 SI. The trend o f MS values rises from 80 to $140\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , where there is an overal l decrease in NGR. NGR also shows several distinct peaks at 48.5, 61, and $64.5\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ in Hole U1459A and 65, 100, and $170~\mathrm{m}$ CSF- A in Hole U1459B. These peaks proved to be of value for stratigraphi c correlation (Figure F9). $P$ -wave sonic velocities measured shallowe r than $200\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A on whole-round cores and discrete sample s compare well. In the upper $200\,\mathrm{\m},$ velocities are typically ${<}2000$ $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ . Deeper than $200\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, $P.$ -wave velocities show high value s (up to $6257\ \mathrm{m/s};$ ) because they were obtained from lithified sediment, including cherts and dolomitic cobbles. Reflectance spectroscopy  and  colorimetry  data  display  high-amplitude  variability, consistent with notable color changes in the sediments. Porosity i s generally high, ranging between $50\%$ and $60\%$ to $120\mathrm{\;m\;CSF-A}$ . Further downcore, porosity decreases to a minimum of $35\%$ at $208.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

# Downhole logging  

Downhole measurements in Hole U1459C were successful an d consisted of runs with the triple combination (combo) and the Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic tool strings. The triple comb o string was deployed with a reduced configuration (without the porosity, density, and resistivity tools). The triple combo measure d borehole width, NGR, and MS from 72.2 (the end of the drill pipe ) to $390\;\mathrm{m}$ wireline log matched depth below seafloor (WMSF). Tw o up and down passes were made with this tool. Borehole condition s prevented the FMS-sonic tool from passing deeper than $288\,\mathrm{~m~}$ WMSF. The wireline NGR agrees well with the data from wholeround cores from Hole U1459B: many peaks and troughs from Hol e U1459B cores were reproduced by the downhole logs from Hol e  

U1459C (Figure F9). These data show that the important NG R peaks in the upper $150\mathrm{~m~}$ of Hole U1459C were mainly driven b y variations in $\mathrm{U}$ content. The NGR peak in the downhole loggin g data at $160\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{WMSF}$ corresponds to the NGR peak in Hole U1459 B cores at $168\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ and results from increased concentrations o f both U and K. The NGR peak in the downhole logging data at $185\,\mathrm{m}$ WMSF corresponds to the NGR peak in Hole U1459B cores at 19 2 m CSF-A and is the result of increased concentrations of Th and K, which may be consistent with an increase in detrital mineral input. Downhole MS confirmed the increasing trend in susceptibility between 75 and $145\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{WMSF}$ that was also observed in core measurements from the WRMSL. However, between 145 and $155\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF- A the core-based MS data from Hole U1459B show a rapid decreas e that is not observed in the downhole logging data. In contrast, th e latter continue to increase gradually with depth between 145 an d $210\mathrm{~m~WMSF},$ although a correlation of meter- to decimeter-scal e variations between the core-based MS data from Hole U1459B an d wireline K concentration data from Hole U1459C was noted. FM S images reveal differences in resistivity that reflect changes in textures  and  lithology  through  the  logged  interval $:\!112\!-\!286\;\mathrm{~m~}$ WMSF). The image quality is high deeper than ${\sim}250~\mathrm{m}$ WMSF bu t poor at shallower depths because of poor contact with the borehol e walls. The spacing between alternations of high- and low-resistivit y values deeper than $250\;\mathrm{m}$ WMSF ranges from several decimeters t o $2\,\textrm{m}$ , with thin (several decimeters) resistive layers interbedde d within broader $\left(1{-}2\ m\right)$ more conductive areas. Between 100 an d $200\;\mathrm{m}$ WMSF, sonic velocities from Hole U1459C tend to be a fe w hundred meters per second higher than sonic velocities obtaine d from discrete measurements with the $P_{\|}$ -wave caliper from Hol e U1459B. At $216\mathrm{~m~WMSF}$ , downhole sonic velocities peak at 322 8 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ . This observation is in agreement with the discrete $P$ -wave velocity measurements made on a lithified dolomitic cobble from Section 356-U1459C-4R-1 ( $215.34\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A). These results sugges t that the retrieved dolomitic cobbles can be considered representative of the formation in this interval. Between 217 and $245\,\mathrm{~m~}$ WMSF, downhole sonic velocities are relatively constant with variations between 2150 and $2400~\mathrm{m/s}$ . In this interval, discrete measurements were only possible on lithified cobbles, and those soni c velocities exceeded $5000~\mathrm{m/s}$ . Therefore, these cobbles should no t be considered representative of the cored sediments.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Three holes were cored at Site U1459. The highest recovery occurred in Hole U1459B and ranged from Late Pleistocene to middl e Miocene in age. Unfortunately, recovery in Hole U1459A was no t sufficient to allow for either detailed analysis or a high-resolutio n correlation between Holes U1459A and U1459B. Hole U1459C extends into the Eocene. Wireline NGR data were generated fro m Hole U1459C, but the very low core recovery limited the ability t o correlate between Hole U1459C lithology and the wireline log. Sedimentation rates are between 0.4 and $1.4~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the Paleogene, relatively low in the Miocene $(<\!1\,\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{ky})$ , very high during the middle Pliocene (nearly $15~\mathrm{cm/ky},$ , and $>\!1\,\mathrm{\cm/ky}$ in the Pleistocen e (Figure F9).  

# Site U1460  

Site U1460 lies in the northern part of the Perth Basin, about 1 8 nmi north of Site U1459 and $\mathord{\sim}150\;\mathrm{m}$ from the adjacent Morangie- 1 Well on the Carnarvon ramp (James et al., 1999; Collins et al., 2014). The site is north of the Houtman-Abrolhos main reef complex, which contains the most southerly tropical reefs in the India n Ocean. Site U1460 is at the northern edge of the modern winterdominated rainfall zone of southwestern Australia and was targete d to chart the timing of this regime; prior to drilling this site we suggested that it was not likely to yield an orbital-scale climate recor d because of slope erosional processes. However, coring recovered  a $300\;\mathrm{m}$ thick late Pliocene to Pleistocene record that may indeed reveal orbital-scale climate variability and complement the record a t Site U1461. Site U1460 is south of a climatic divide between th e Australian monsoon–dominated north and the westerly winddriven, winter rainfall–dominated south. The site is near the southern end of our north–south latitudinal transect and also provides  a shelf to shelf-edge record of the tropical–subtropical transition related to Leeuwin Current activity. Site U1460 is influenced by th e anticlockwise, colder West Australian Current gyre; the relative influence of this gyre versus the Leeuwin Current produces variation s in paleoproductivity that may be documented over millions o f years. Subsidence rates in this region are estimated to be significantly less than in the Carnarvon Basin further north because o f variations in mantle dynamic subsidence between the Perth an d Carnarvon Basins. Paleobathymetric analyses should produce th e first detailed $^{>1}$ My subsidence record for this part of the Wester n Australian margin, where previous subsidence estimates only extend to $125\,\mathrm{ka}$ (Collins and Testa, 2010).  

# Lithostratigraphy  

Site U1460 consists of two lithostratigraphic units, with thre e subunits in the upper unit (Figure F10). Unit boundaries are define d by the first occurrence of a new lithology downhole. Subunits ar e distinguished primarily by differences in the most abundant fossils, diagenesis, and mineralogical components. Lithified intervals characterized by authigenic mineralization, and interpreted as hardgrounds,  define  the  boundaries  between  subunits.  Lithologi c descriptions are based on sediments recovered from Holes U1460 A $0{-}300.08\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) and U1460B (0–306.65 m CSF-A):  

Figure F10. Site U1460 summary showing core recovery, lithostratigraphic units, age, magnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and NGR. For Hole U1460B, onl y limited biostratigraphy (Cores 65F through 68F) and no magnetostratigraphic analyses were performed, so age-depth model for both holes is presented as  a composite, resulting in an inconsistency in planktonic foraminiferal datums and associated sedimentation rates from $\mathord{\sim}300$ to $^{280}\,\mathsf{m}$ CSF-A. Note the differen t sedimentation rates for planktonic foraminiferal (blue) and calcareous nannofossil (green) datums. Open circles $=$ depth for D. altispira in Holes U1460A (uppe r point at 279.36 m CSF-A) and U1460B (lower point at $298.92\,\mathsf{m}$ CSF-A) (see Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology in the Site U1460 chapter [Gallagher e t al., 2017d]). Benthic foraminiferal assemblages were smoothed to generate this synthesis, resulting in slight differences from data presented in hole summaries.  

![](images/ba2bbd0af1d2e8e86f9803f63b74fa95eeef8641c62e7ec79985498db63b305c.jpg)  

• Unit I encompasses most of Holes U1460A (0–252.70 m CSF-A) and U1460B $\mathrm{\!\left(0{-}252.00\,m\,C S F{-}A\right)\!}$ and consists of predominantly unlithified to partially lithified skeletal packstone with wackestone and grainstone intervals. This unit is divided into three subunits based on the abundances of macrofossils, sponge spicules, and degree of diagenesis: • Macrofossils are concentrated in Subunit Ia (Hole $\mathrm{U}1460\mathrm{A}=$ $0{-}44.90\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ and Hole $\mathrm{U1460B}=0.44.94\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A})$ , • Sponge spicules are concentrated in Subunit Ib (Hole $\mathrm{U1460A}=44.90{-}174.53\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and Hole $\mathrm{U}1460\mathrm{B}=$ $44.94{-}173.36\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ ), and • Subunit Ic (Hole $\mathrm{U1460A=174.53\mathrm{-252.70\m\,CSF\mathrm{-A}}}$ and Hole $\mathrm{U1460B}=173.36{-}252.00\mathrm{~m~C~}$ SF-A) has a high authigenic glauconite and increased dolomite and macrofossil content.   
• Unit II (Hole $\mathrm{U1460A}=252.70\mathrm{-300.08~m~CSF}.$ -A and Hole $\mathrm{U1460B}=252.00{-}306.65\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ ) consists of unlithified to partially lithified packstone, mudstone, and wackestone. Unit II is defined by the first appearance of a mass-wasting deposit. The mass-wasting deposits in Unit II, characterized by graded or contorted beds, are interpreted as turbidity current deposits, slumping sediments, and debris flows.  

# Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology  

A total of 54 smear slides were examined for calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphic marker species and common taxa. Calcareous nannofossils are common to dominant and show overall goo d preservation in the (predominantly) packstone sediments recovere d at Site U1460. The nannofossil assemblages are dominated by placolith-bearing members of the Noelaerhabdaceae family, most notably by small $(<\!4\;\upmu\mathrm{m})$ Gephyrocapsa spp. and Reticulofenestra spp. The early Pleistocene–late Pliocene marker species Discoaster brouweri (top at $1.93\,\mathrm{\:Ma}_{\mathrm{,}}$ ) is rare from Sample 356-U1460A-45F-C C $(208.85\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ to the base of Hole U1460A (65F-CC $\left[300.08\;\mathrm{m}\right.$ CSF-A]). The top occurrences of Sphenolithus spp. in Samples 63FCC (293.45 m CSF-A) and 356-U1460B-65F-CC $295.04\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A ) indicate that the bases of both holes are of middle Pliocene age.  

Planktonic foraminifer preservation and abundance is significantly better at Site U1460 than at Sites U1458 and U1459. Biozon e Pt1a $(0.61{-}1.93\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ; top of $G.$ . tosaensis and base of Globorotali a truncatulinoides) is between Samples 356-U1460A-19F-CC an d 57F-CC (86.5 and $265.2\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A). Deeper than Sample 60F-C C $(279.3\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A), a Pliocene assemblage is present (Biozone PL4 ) that indicates a minimum age of $3.47\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (top of D. altispira). Th e bottom of Hole U1460B (68F-CC $[306.65\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}]$ ) is within Biozone PL2 (top of Globorotalia margaritae) and is based on the presence of $G.$ crassaformis. Site U1460 has an oldest age of $4.3\,M{\bf a}$ (bas e of Biozone PL2) (Figure F10).  

The samples contain between $13\%$ and $63\%$ benthic foraminifers; Cibicides spp. and Cibicidoides spp. are the most common taxa. Four assemblages can be identified based on the abundances of $U_{\cdot}$ peregrina, Siphogenerina raphana, Bolivina spp., Trifarina spp., Cibicides spp., and Cibicidoides spp. Samples contain 7–35 species. Except for the uppermost three samples from Hole U1460A (1F-C C through 9F-CC [2.13–35.6 m CSF-A]), preservation is poor and affected by fragmentation and abrasion. The proportion of planktonics suggest outer shelf to upper slope $(100{-}500\;\mathrm{m})$ paleodepths.  

# Geochemistry  

At Site U1460, 64 samples were analyzed for headspace gas content, 31 samples (5 cm whole rounds) for IW geochemistry, and 3 1 samples for TOC, carbonate, and TN. In general, elevated salinit y characterizes the site, with values of 35 at the top, increasing wit h depth to 61 at $287\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Increasing trends of most of major elements in the IW samples are reflected in the salinity record. However, K decreases slightly downhole from 10.9 to $8.2\;\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{{r}}}$ , possibl y reflecting the decreasing clay content in the deeper sediments. Silica is $381~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at the surface and increases to a maximum value o f $1683\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at $137\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. From 137 to $193\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , silica concentration decreases to ${\sim}1200~\upmu\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{z}}$ followed by relatively stable value s to the bottom of Hole U1460A. Variations in elemental silico n might imply the importance of biogenic silica in these sediments, related to the interval of high sponge spicule content (lithostratigraphic Subunit Ib). Furthermore, the site is also characterized b y high percentages of calcium carbonate (mean value $=90\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ an d low TOC (mean value $=0.48\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) and TN (mean value $=0.03\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ). Relatively low calcium carbonate content seems to be related to th e section with higher sponge spicule content.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1460 included routin e measurements and partial AF demagnetization of NRM of archivehalf core sections and selected discrete samples from working-hal f sections of Hole U1460A. Hole U1460B was not measured sinc e lithologic similarities to Hole U1460A indicated overlapping stratigraphy. Isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) and backfiel d IRM curves from discrete samples provide coercivity of remanenc e values ranging from 40.7 to $67.0\,\mathrm{mT}$ . Further cumulative log-Gaussian analysis indicates three components—two of them providin g the main contribution to the IRM pattern and exhibiting low magnetic coercivity behavior, which are parameters indicative of th e presence of magnetite and/or titanomagnetite. A third componen t presented high-coercivity behavior $\mathrm{(B_{1/2}=263\;m T)}$ , which suggest s the presence of hematite and/or goethite. Residual NRM intensit y values range from $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-5}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ after AF demagnetization wit h peak fields of $30~\mathrm{mT}$ . Based on nannofossil-based age constraint s (0.91 Ma at $129\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A), the observed polarity reversal at ${\sim}120\;\mathrm{m}$ may represent Subchron C1r.1r $(0.988{-}0.781\ \mathrm{Ma})$ near the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary (Subchron C1n/C1r.1r) at $0.781\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

# Physical properties  

Core recovery at Site U1460 was very high $(97\%)$ , so measurements were able to demonstrate clearly how physical properties parameters vary with depth. MS shows large-scale trends that ar e similar between both holes and between both the WRMSL and Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL). All MS records show a general decrease of ${\sim}2\,{\cal S}{\cal I}$ from the top to $180{-}200\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. From tha t depth to the bases of both holes ( ${\sim}300\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A), an increase of $1-$ $2\:S\mathrm{I}$ is observed in all MS records. However, meter-scale variabilit y is not consistent from hole to hole and between the WRMSL an d SHMSL. The NGR data are characterized by strong variations wit h an amplitude up to 30 counts/s that can be correlated between th e holes at vertical scales of tens of meters, despite measuring at different resolutions between Holes U1460A $\langle10\ \mathrm{cm}\rangle$ and U1460B (2 0 cm). Moreover, hardground and condensed layers produced majo r peaks in the NGR data (more than 140 counts/s), facilitating accurate correlation of these layers between holes (Figure F10). Porosit y decreases from $50\%{-}60\%$ at the top to $39\%{-}49\%$ at the bases of bot h holes. Correlation between decreasing porosity and increasing $P_{-}$ wave velocities $/R\,=\,0.405)$ , bulk densities $(R=0.88)$ ), and therma l conductivities $\langle R=0.67\rangle$ ) suggests that these variations may be, i n part, due to compaction. In situ formation temperature measurements were made in Hole U1460B to complement the thermal conductivity  measurements.  This  allowed  for  calculation  of  th e geothermal flux $\mathrm{{}}^{\left(62\mathrm{{\mW}/m^{2}}\right)}$ .  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Attempts to correlate Holes U1460A and U1460B were mad e using NGR data; the core logger was run at $10~\mathrm{cm}$ resolution o n Hole U1460A and $20~\mathrm{cm}$ resolution on Hole U1460B cores. Th e GRA data collected on the Special Task Multisensor Logger and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ collected on the SHMSL were also used for correlation purposes. Correlations were further constrained by the core photos and lithologic descriptions, particularly of debris flows and hardgrounds. The lithologic descriptions show considerable variation across th e two holes, especially in the lower part of the section where debri s flows were found. Unfortunately, the fact that only two holes wer e cored, both using the half-length advanced piston corer (HLAPC ) system, did not allow for generation of a complete splice, althoug h the approximate correlation is useful for Site U1460 sampling.  

Sedimentation rates are generally low in the Pliocene and hig h in the Pleistocene (Figure F10), although there is some divergenc e in rates calculated from calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminiferal datums. Sedimentation rates produced from planktoni c foraminiferal datums indicate moderate to high rates in Pliocen e Zones PL2 $\mathrm{2~\,cm/ky;}$ Hole U1460B) and PL4 $(20~\mathrm{cm/ky;}$ Hol e U1460A). Zone PL4 correlates with a zone of mass wasting in lowe r Unit II. In contrast, calcareous nannofossil–based rates associate d with glauconite-rich zones of mass wasting in Unit II are low (between 1.3 and $3.6~\mathrm{{cm/ky})}$ . Just above this level and just above th e Pliocene/Pleistocene  boundary $(\mathrm{~\sim~}280\mathrm{-}265\mathrm{~\m~\,~}\mathrm{CSF-A}$ in  Hol e U1460A), low planktonic foraminifer–derived sedimentation rate s $(0.9\mathrm{~cm/ky})$ occur at the change from mud-rich wackestone to  a more sandy packstone and indicate reduced deposition (or a possible unconformity). Sedimentation rates are generally very hig h throughout the Pleistocene $(12{-}39\ \mathrm{cm/ky})$ ) except for one low sedimentation rate interval $({\sim}208.85{-}176.24\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ near the base o f Zone NN19 $(1.93{-}1.14\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . The unit terminates at a hardgroun d around the base of Core 356-U1460A-38F (\~177 m CSF-A).  

# Site U1461  

Site U1461 is $100~\mathrm{km}$ northwest of Barrow Island in the NCB, $\sim\!150\mathrm{~m~}$ from the West Tryal Rocks-2 Well. It is on the edge of a n outer shelf ramp (James et al., 2004). The seabed in the region i s poorly sorted carbonate-rich $(>\!90\%)$ sediment made up of bioclasti c gravel, sand, and mud (Jones, 1973; James et al., 2004). Coring a t Site U1461 targeted a $1\,\mathrm{km}$ thick outer shelf to upper slope carbonate wedge that onlaps (because of basin-wide subsidence) a regiona l top Miocene surface.  

The primary objective of Site U1461 was to obtain a ${>}4$ My orbital-scale record of climate variability and monsoonal history comparable in resolution to other global climate proxy records. On e benefit of coring this shelf-margin setting is that terrigenous cla y and terrestrial palynomorphs should be abundant, delivered by fluvial outflow during the rainy season (van der Kaars and De Deckker, 2003). This location is also close to the southern boundary of Australian monsoonal influence and can be used to chart its latitudina l variability. Marine microfossil paleoproductivity analyses at this sit e should also reveal the dominance of the West Australian Curren t over the Leeuwin Current during glacial periods, when the Australian monsoon is thought to have been weak (Gallagher et al., 2014b). There are intervals in this section that consist of plankton ooz e (Gallagher et al., 2009) deposited at upper to middle slope paleodepths. Therefore, combining C/O and $\mathrm{Mg/Ca}$ analyses o f microfossils from Site U1461 should produce a Pliocene–Pleistocene obliquity- (or even precession-) scale record that can be directly compared and correlated to the LR2004 stack (Lisiecki an d Raymo, 2005) for chronostratigraphic and paleoceanographic analyses. Site U1461 is downdip from a drowned reef on a paleoshel f edge (Gallagher et al., 2014b). By dating the reflectors and correlating them updip, it will be possible to constrain the age of onset o f this reef and other reefs regionally. Furthermore, downslope-transported reefal or shelf detritus into this section will enable analysis o f reef and ramp development in response to variable sea level.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The lithostratigraphy of Site U1461 is divided into four units , with six subunits in Unit II (Figure F11):  

• Unit I (Hole $\mathrm{U1461A=0{-}11.00\ m\subset}\mathrm{SF{-}A}$ , Hole $\mathrm{U}1461\mathrm{B}=0-$ $11.30\,\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{CSF-A}}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and Hole $\mathrm{U1461C}=0{-}11.40\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A})$ consists of mainly unlithified homogeneous olive-gray to brown to greenish gray packstone with benthic foraminifers and bivalves.   
• Unit II (Hole $\mathrm{U1461A}=11.00{-}284.71\;\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{CSF}}{-}\,\!\!\!\!$ A, Hole $\mathrm{U}1461\mathrm{B}=$ $11.30{-}466.40\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{e}$ CSF-A, Hole $\mathrm{U1461C=11.40{-}443.88\;m\;C S F{-}A},$ and Hole $\mathrm{U1461D}=455.00{-}466.98\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ ) is divided into six subunits (IIa, IIb, IIc, IId, IIe, and IIf in descending order). In Unit II, all subunits except Subunit IIa consist of two intervals: (1) an upper coarser grained, darker colored, thicker interval of unlithified dark greenish gray to olive-gray packstone/wackestone and (2) a lower, finer grained, light-colored, thinner interval of unlithified, homogeneous, cream to light gray mudstone. The exception, Subunit IIa, consists entirely of light-colored mudstone/wackestone. Throughout Unit II, the lower interval of each subunit is always thinner than the upper interval. These upper and lower intervals are further distinguished by differences in degree of bioturbation and abundances of macrofossils and peloids and, in the case of Subunit IIf, the presence of lowangle cross-stratification and normal grading. Ooids occur in Subunits IIa and IIb.   
• Unit III (Hole $\mathrm{U1461B}=466.40{-}877.74\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF}{-}$ A and Hole $\mathrm{U1461D}=466.98{-992.88~m~C S F-}$ ) consists of lithified wackestone ranging in color from greenish gray to olive-gray. Bioturbation is common throughout the unit, and burrows are often filled with coarse sand. Foraminifers are common, whereas fragments of bivalves and gastropods are rare. In the lower half of Unit III there are a variety of sedimentary contacts, ranging from sharp to wavy, gradational, and scoured. The occurrence of these contacts often coincides with numerous sedimentary features, including parallel lamination, thin bedding, normal grading, load casts, slump folds, and intraclasts. Pyrite is also present in the lower half of Unit III as disseminated grains and nodules.   
• Unit IV ( $\mathrm{Iole\;U1461D}=992.88\mathrm{-1088.92\;m\;CSF-A})$ consists of lithified, light greenish gray, fine sand–sized packstone (interbedded with wackestone with mud-sized grains) that grades into creamy gray packstone with coarse sand–sized grains (interbedded with packstone with coarser sand–sized grains). Near the base of the unit, the lithology transitions back to light greenish gray packstone with fine sand–sized grains, interbedded with wackestone with mud-sized grains. Bioturbation, benthic foraminifers, and pyrite are more abundant in muddy intervals. Bedding contacts are sharp. Planar laminae and normal grading are present in the coarser grained intervals.

Gray bar $=$ casing depth; note the resulting dampened signal of the gamma log. Biostratigraphic zone boundar y ages are shown. Age-depth model was produced from select biostratigraphic datums (see Table T6 in the Site U1461 chapter [Gallagher et al., 2017e]) colo r coded by hole (solid circles $=$ calcareous nannofossil, open circles $=$ planktonic foraminifer). Sedimentation rates assume a linear sedimentation rate betwee n datums. Position of the unconformity (wavy line) in the Miocene is determined by lithologic change in Section 356-U1461D-51R-CC. Benthic foraminifera l assemblages were smoothed to generate this synthesis, resulting in slight differences from data presented in hole summaries.

# Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology  

Core catcher samples from Site U1461 were analyzed at $20\textrm{m}$ resolution through Holes U1461A, U1461B, and U1461D. In Hol e U1461C, sampling focused on the uppermost $53\textrm{m}$ (mudline an d Cores 1H through 6H) and deeper than ${\sim}370\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (57F-C C through 73F-CC $[443.88\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}]$ ). The bottoms of Holes U1461 A $(284.71\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) and U1461C $\mathrm{(443.88\;m\;CSF{-}A)}$ ) are of early Pleistocene age (base of Zone NN19, ${\angle1.93\,\mathrm{\Ma}})$ ). The sediments retrieved from Hole U1461B (a total of 129 cores) are of Pliocene– Pleistocene age, with the bottom $(877.74\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ ) estimated to b e older than 4.08 Ma (based on planktonic foraminifers). Hol e U1461D was analyzed from $456.36\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to total depth (1088.9 2 m CSF-A). The abundance and preservation of calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers decrease markedly from Sampl e  

356-U1461D-52R-CC ( $1008.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) downhole with possibl e reworking, suggesting a probable unconformity. The bottom o f Hole U1461D dates to the middle to late Miocene $({<}12.38{-}8.79\,\mathrm{Ma};$ based on nannofossils) (Figure F11).  

Samples from Holes U1461A–U1461D contain between $5\%$ an d $91\%$ benthic foraminifers with Cibicides spp. and Cibicidoides spp. as the most common taxa. Six assemblages were identified based o n benthic abundances:  

• Assemblage 1: A. lessonii, Hyalinea baltica, and Sahulia barkeri • Assemblage 2: Elphidium spp.   
• Assemblage 3: Neoeponides margaritifer   
• Assemblage 4: Uvigerina spp.   
• Assemblage 5: Nodosaria spp. and Stilostomella spp.   
• Assemblage 6: Globocassidulina subglobosa  

Seven to 63 species are present in the samples. Preservation varie s from moderate to poor throughout the site and was affected by fragmentation and abrasion.  

# Geochemistry  

At Site U1461, 140 samples were analyzed for headspace ga s content, 38 samples $^{5-15}\,\mathrm{cm}$ whole rounds) for IW geochemistry, and 38 samples for TOC, carbonate, and TN. IW samples were no t collected in Holes U1461C and U1461D. Hole U1461C recovered  a section previously sampled in Holes U1461A and U1461B, and th e lithology at the bottom of Hole U1461B $(877.74\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) yielde d insufficient pore water, so there was no possibility of obtaining sufficient amounts of pore water from deeper intervals in Hol e U1461D. In general, elevated salinity characterizes the site, with  a value of 35 at the top, increasing gradually with depth to 137 at 87 0 m CSF-A. Coincident increasing trends with depth of bromide, chloride, and sodium in the IW samples are consistent with the salinity record. Increasing trends of alkalinity, $\mathsf{p H},$ , and ammoniu m and a decreasing trend of sulfate indicate a reduction zone in th e upper $100\,\mathrm{m}$ of the site. Finally, the site is characterized by high percentages of calcium carbonate (mean value $=\sim\!80\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{\,\,wt\%}}$ ) and lo w TOC (mean value $=0.9\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) and TN (mean value $=0.04\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ ).  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic investigations focused on NRM and partial A F demagnetization measurements. To address some technical issue s (flux jumps) related to the superconducting rock magnetomete r (SRM) measurements from Holes U1461B and U1461C, a representative group of discrete samples underwent AF demagnetizatio n and were compared to the SRM directional data to provide more reliable magnetostratigraphic interpretations. This issue was fixed fo r Hole  U1461D  archive-half  section  measurements.  For  Hole s U1461B and U1461C, comparisons between results from the archive-half and discrete sample measurements indicate normal (negative) overprint until $30{-}50\,\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization steps, which coul d not be fully cleaned after SRM AF demagnetization procedures (u p to $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ ). IRM and backfield IRM acquisition curves were also carried out to investigate rock magnetism properties. Most sample s seem to reach saturation IRM (SIRM) between 100 and $300~\mathrm{mT}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , which is indicative of a wide range of magnetic carriers and was verified for a narrow range of coercivity of remanence values (45–5 0 mT). Complementary XRD measurements indicated, for at leas t one sample from Hole U1461B, the presence of low- (e.g., magnetite, titanomagnetite, and maghemite), intermediate- (e.g., greigite), and high- (e.g., hematite, greigite, and goethite) coercivity phases. Magnetostratigraphy  for  Hole  U1461C  indicated  the  Brunhes/Matuyama boundary (0.781 Ma) is between 45 and $65\mathrm{\;m\,CSF-A}$ and the Jaramillo Subchron $(0.988\ \mathrm{Ma})$ is between 281 and $316~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Figure F11). Hole U1461D magnetostratigraphic data indicates a succession of magnetozones in a good agreement with biostratigraphic datums, suggesting the Matuyama/Gauss (2.581 Ma ) and Gauss/Gilbert $3.596\;\mathrm{Ma})$ boundaries at 725 and ${\sim}827~\mathrm{m}~\mathrm{CSF}.$ - A, respectively, as well as the Subchron C3n.4n (Thvera) interva l (4.997–5.235 Ma), close to the Pliocene/Miocene boundary (Figur e F11).  

# Physical properties  

Physical properties measurements at Site U1461 were performed using the WRMSL, NGR sensor, and discrete sampling. Light-colored sediments were discriminated by high $L^{\ast}$ values an d corresponded to relatively low MS and high grain density. This pattern was interpreted to result from high micrite and low detrital cla y components in these sediments. Thermal conductivity of sediment s increases gradually with depth, from about $1\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\mathrm{{\cdotK}})$ in the uppe r portion of Holes U1461A and U1461B to ${\sim}1.8\;\mathrm{W/(m{\cdot}K)}$ at ${\sim}1000\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1461D. These measurements were used in combination with downhole in situ temperature measurements to calculate a geothermal heat flux of $41.1\:\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ . Between 125 and $450\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, sonic velocity measurements by both the WRMSL and discrete sampling were often unsuccessful, as the cored material i s characterized by a large degree of expansion, hampering such measurements. However, in the deeper parts of Holes U1461B an d U1461D, discrete measurements of sonic velocity were successful; velocities gradually increase with depth from ${\sim}1750~\mathrm{m/s}$ at $450\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A to ${\sim}2800~\mathrm{m/s}$ at $925\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. In the lower part of Hol e U1461D ( $925{-}1080\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A), sonic velocities are relatively constant and range between 2400 and $2900\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . Porosity is about $60\%-$ $70\%$ in the top $50\;\mathrm{m}$ and decreases to $28\%{-}34\%$ at the bottom of th e deepest hole (Hole U1461D). Grain density averages ${\sim}2.75~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , with high values reflecting the presence of aragonite, which occur s in varying amounts in the top half of the cored interval (uppe r ${\sim}600\;\mathrm{m})$ ).  

# Downhole logging  

Downhole measurements in Hole U1461D consisted of run s with the triple combo and the FMS-sonic tool strings. Unfortunately, the MS and FMS data obtained during wireline logging wer e judged not to be of sufficient quality for interpretation. The wirelin e NGR data agree well with data obtained from whole-round core s (Figure F11). In the upper $450\;\mathrm{m},$ , NGR is relatively low, except fo r some distinct peaks. The NGR data show that the large peaks in th e upper $460\;\mathrm{m}$ were mainly driven by variations in U content. At 45 0 m WMSF, there is a stepwise increase in NGR values to ${\sim}35\$ counts/s; in the interval between 450 and $820\;\mathrm{m}$ WMSF NGR fluctuates around 35 counts/s, increases further to 40 counts/s betwee n 820 and $850\mathrm{~m~WMSF},$ , and then is stable between 850 and $1000\;\mathrm{m}$ WMSF. Many NGR peaks and troughs observed in cores were als o found in the downhole logs and were used for core-log correlation. This correlation indicates that the offset between wireline (WMSF ) and coring (CSF-A) depths varies between 4 and $^{8\textrm{m}}$ throughou t Hole U1461D. In the upper $450\ \mathrm{m},$ , density and porosity measurements are unreliable because of partial collapse of the hole, bu t deeper than $450\,\textrm{m}$ WMSF, there is good agreement between th e wireline and core-based values. Porosity decreases from $\sim\!48\%$ a t $450\mathrm{~m~WMSF}$ to $\sim\!30\%$ at $1030~\mathrm{m}$ WMSF, whereas bulk density increases from 2.0 to $2.2~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in the same depth interval. Overall, where the logging underestimated bulk density, it overestimated porosity compared to data obtained from discrete samples.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

The upper $285\;\mathrm{m}$ of Site U1461 was triple cored using a combination of the piston coring (advanced piston corer [APC] an d HLAPC) and XCB systems. This interval was correlated and a splic e was generated, although there is less confidence in the correlation i n some intervals between 240 and $285\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. This lower confidence is related to the low variation in NGR and MS data (e.g., Cores 356-U1461A-30F and 31F, 356-U1461B-27F through 29F, an d 356-U1461C-26F through 28F) coupled with the recovery of $4.7~\mathrm{m}$ cores (HLAPC) instead of full length $_{(9.5\textrm{m})}$ APC cores. Althoug h the HLAPC enabled greater recovery of high-quality core overall, the relative size of the gaps between cores is greater than with th e APC and a high affine growth factor (a measure of the fractional stretching of the composite section relative to the drilled interva l $\left[\sim\!114\%\right])$ also made correlation more challenging. The deeper section penetrated in Holes U1461B (Cores 81X through 126X) an d U1461D (Cores 5R through 61R) was also correlated, but significan t recovery gaps do not permit the generation of a continuous section.  

Sedimentation rates (Figure F11) are generally low in the Miocene and remain low across the unconformity and into the earl y Pliocene. Sedimentation rates more than double in middle Pliocen e Zone NN15 and decrease to around $8~\,\mathrm{{cm/ky}}$ around the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary. Rates increase again in the early Pleistocene, but the very high rates $(37\mathrm{-}52\ \mathrm{cm/ky})$ are associated wit h gravity flows. Rates decrease in the latest Pleistocene $(0.44\mathrm{~Ma})$ t o $6{-}13\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ but are still well above average sedimentation rates i n the deep sea.  

# Site U1462  

Site U1462 is $50\,\mathrm{km}$ north of the Montobello Islands in the NC B adjacent $(\sim\!150\mathrm{~m})$ to the Fisher-1 Well. Site U1462 is on the oute r edge $\,\!87\,\mathfrak{m}$ water depth) of a middle ramp (James et al., 2004). Th e seabed in the region is carbonate-rich $(>\!90\,\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ ) gravel and san d with minor mud (Jones, 1973; James et al., 2004). Coring at Sit e U1462 targeted a sequence of shelfal to shelf-edge carbonates tha t overlie a Miocene sand unit (the Bare Formation).  

The primary aim of coring Site U1462 was to obtain a record o f the variation in ITF connectivity over the last 5 My. Previous analyses of foraminifers in 28 sidewall cores from the adjacent Fisher- 1 Well revealed carbonates that contain horizons of biogeographicall y significant Indo-Pacific foraminifers (sensu Gallagher et al., 2009), suggesting intermittent ITF connectivity. Further analyses are likel y to reveal a more complete record of ITF connectivity than previously recognized. Another objective of Site U1462 was to date strat a adjacent to several drowned reefs (Gallagher et al., 2014b) to determine the age and environmental conditions of their onset. Facie s and fossil paleoenvironmental analyses of the succession will she d light on when, how, and why these reefs first developed and wh y they drowned. An additional aim was to obtain an interglacial Pliocene–Pleistocene record of the Australian monsoon. Site U146 2 was closer to the shoreline during this time than Site U1461 and i s likely to yield significantly more terrigenous material. Finally, postexpedition analyses of a variety of shallow- and deep-water carbonate facies will allow detailed estimates of Pliocene–Pleistocen e paleobathymetry and subsidence.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The lithostratigraphy of Site U1462 is divided into four unit s (Figure F12):  

• Unit I (Hole $\mathrm{U1462A=0-300.90\;m\;(}$ CSF-A, Hole $\mathrm{U}1462\mathrm{B}=0-$ $47.80\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ , and Hole $\mathrm{U1462C}=33.00{-}256.70\mathrm{~m~}^{\circ}$ CSF-A) is characterized by partially to fully lithified, light grayish green to dark greenish gray nonskeletal packstone with lesser amounts of skeletal packstone to grainstone. The grainstone consists mainly of medium to coarse sand–sized grains with minor amounts of gravel and fine sand, as well as macrofossils, peloids, and ooids. Common macrofossils include bivalves, gastropods, barnacles, solitary corals, echinoderms, scaphopods, bryozoans, brachiopods, and serpulids. Small and larger benthic foraminifers are common, whereas planktonic foraminifers are scarce. Some sedimentary structures, such as planar laminations, slight to moderate bioturbation, and sharp to wavy, gradational, and bioturbated contacts are visible in the few cores with greater recovery.  

The transition from Unit I to II is characterized by the disappearance of large $(>\!250\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ peloids, a distinct increase in planktonic foraminifers and siliciclastic components, and a transition from neritic to hemipelagic facies.  

• Unit II (Hole $\mathrm{U1462A}=300.90{-}777.30\;\mathrm{m}\;{\mathrm{CSF}}{-}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!$ and Hole $[1462\mathrm{C}=256.70\mathrm{-}777.88\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}]$ ) mainly consists of lithified olive-gray packstones with some wackestone intervals. Grain size is gradational, from very fine sand-sized grains to coarse sand-sized grains toward the base of Unit II. Diverse and abundant macrofossils in the upper part of Unit II include bivalves, gastropods, scaphopods, bryozoans, and echinoderms, but bioclasts (mainly bivalve fragments) become much less common with depth. In contrast, small benthic foraminifers are common throughout Unit II. Bioturbation is variable throughout the unit, and there is evidence for gravitational flows and other smallscale mass transport deposits (e.g., laminations, grading, and contact surfaces) toward the base of Unit II.   
• Unit III (Hole $\mathrm{U1462A}=777.30–843.03\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ and Hole $\mathrm{U1462C}=777.88{-}843.48~\mathrm{m}~\mathrm{CSF}{-}$ A) is distinguished from Unit II by higher quartz content. In Hole U1462A, Unit III consists of lithified gray to olive-gray packstone with fine to medium sand– sized quartz grains and various macrofossils, including bivalves, gastropods, bryozoans, echinoderms, and small benthic foraminifers. In Hole U1462C, the transition between Units II and III is characterized by a change in the lithology from packstone to grainstone and a marked contact (a pyrite-rich cemented interval). Below the grainstone interval, Unit III mainly consists of packstone with primarily coarse to medium sand–sized grains; disseminated pyrite is also common. At the base of the unit, the lithology transitions to dark greenish gray, coarse-grained, poorly sorted sandstone containing common LBFs. Bioturbation is more intense in Hole U1462C than Hole U1462A, whereas sedimentary features (e.g., parallel laminations, grading, and bioturbated contacts) are similar throughout the unit in both holes.   
• Unit IV (Hole $\mathrm{U1462A}=843.03{-}849.67\;\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{CSF-A}}$ and Hole $\mathrm{U1462C}=843.48{-}946.09\mathrm{~m~CS}$ F-A) primarily consists of dolostone and quartz-rich sandstone with common anhydrite nodules, intervals of anhydrite rock, and associated chickenwire structures. The top of Unit IV is defined by the first appearance of macroscopic anhydrite nodules and an increase in dolomite. Unit IV varies in color from light brown to gray to white (anhydrite nodules and anhydrite rock) with generally coarse to medium sand–sized grains and minor intervals of fine sand. Bioturbation is slight to moderate but sporadic throughout the unit. Burrows are often filled with dolomite. Macrofossil fragments occur in low numbers throughout the unit and include solitary corals, bivalves, echinoderms, small benthic foraminifers, and fossil molds (e.g., gastropods and bivalves). Parallel laminations are more frequent in the upper part of the unit, whereas dissolution cavities and intermittent moldic porosity appear in the lower part. Contact surfaces are uncommon but if present typically form sharp subhorizontal surfaces. Pyrite grains are intermittently common and sometimes coat intraclasts, quartz, and anhydrite grains.  

# Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology  

Core catcher samples from Site U1462 were processed at $_{20\textrm{m}}$ resolution. Nannofossil analyses were done at $10\,\mathrm{m}$ resolution in selected intervals to better constrain biostratigraphic datums betwee n

Gray bars $=$ casing depth; note the resulting dampened signal of the gamma log. Biostratigraphic zone boundary ages ar e shown. Age-depth model was produced from select biostratigraphic datums (see Table T7 in the Site U1462 chapter [Gallagher et al., 2017f]) (solid circles $=$ calcareous nannofossil, open circles $=$ planktonic foraminifer). Sedimentation rates are calculated separately for planktonic foraminiferal (blue dashed line) an d calcareous nannofossil (green line) datums and assume a linear sedimentation rate between datums. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages were smoothed t o generate this synthesis, resulting in slight differences from data presented in hole summaries.

Holes U1462A–U1462C, and extra benthic foraminiferal sample s were taken from selected intervals to better constrain assemblag e changes between core catcher samples (Figure F12). The upper 39 0 m of Site U1462 contain Pleistocene sediments $^{\prime}{<}1.93\mathrm{~Ma}_{\mathrm{{:}}}$ ; Zone s NN19–NN21; Biozones Pt1a–Pt1b) that yielded very rare nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers. The top occurrence of $P_{\star}$ lacunosa at $42.67\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A $(0.44\,\mathrm{\OmegaMa})$ and the top occurrence o f Reticulofenestra asanoi at 252.5 m CSF-A $(0.91\ \mathrm{Ma})$ are at simila r depths as at Site U1461, whereas older nannofossil $(>\!1.6\ M\mathrm{a})$ an d planktonic foraminifer datums $(>\!1.64\,\,\mathrm{Ma})$ are offset between thes e sites. The Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary is between 527.5 an d $539.97\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, based on the (rare) presence of $D_{\l}$ . surculus (2.4 9 Ma, top of Zone NN16) and the planktonic foraminifer Globorotalia limbata $\left(2.39\ \mathrm{Ma}\right.$ , top of Zone PL5). The microfossil an d planktonic foraminiferal abundance and preservation improve i n the early Pleistocene–Pliocene and the earliest Pliocene–late Miocene intervals between ${\sim}325\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ (Samples 356-U1462A-35XCC and 356-U1462C-62R-CC) and $^{827}\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Samples 356- U1462A-95X-CC and 356-U1462C-153R-CC). Despite the improvement in planktonic foraminifer preservation and abundance a t $368\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, both are still relatively poor compared to Sites U146 0 and U1461. The highest diversity is in samples deeper than $420\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Sample 356-U1462A-87X-CC), which contain up to $90\%$ planktonic foraminiferal taxa. As the general preservation is poor, some of the biozone markers found at previous sites, such as $G$ . limbata, Pulleniatina primalis, and Sphaeroidinellopsis seminulina, ar e rare and often deeper than their expected stratigraphic position. Deeper than ${\sim}820\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, planktonic foraminiferal abundanc e markedly decreases and samples are mostly barren. The bases o f Holes U1462A (849.67 m CSF-A) and U1462C ${\mathrm{946.09~m}}$ CSF-A ) are barren of microfossils, but Samples 356-U1462A-91X-C C through 95X-CC $(807.55\mathrm{-}827.46\mathrm{\,m\,CSF-A})$ and 356-U1462C-149RCC through 153R-CC $(809.15{-}827.65\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ ) yield a late Miocene age based on the presence of the nannofossils $D_{\cdot}$ . quinqueramus (defining the Zone NN11/NN12 boundary at $5.59\,\mathrm{\:Ma})$ an d Reticulofenestra rotaria (short range within Zone NN11B).  

Samples from Holes U1462A–U1462C contain between $9\%$ an d $100\%$ benthic foraminifers with Cibicides spp. and Cibicidoides spp. as the most common taxa. Seven assemblages were identified base d on benthic abundances:  

• Assemblage 1: Operculina spp. and Discorbinella spp.   
• Assemblage 2: Amphistegina spp. and Elphidium spp.   
• Assemblage 3: Melonis spp., Discorbinella spp., and Nonionoides spp.   
• Assemblages 4, 6, and 7: Lenticulina spp., brizalinids, and bolivinids   
• Assemblage 5: Pseudorotalia spp., S. raphana, and N. margaritifer   
• Assemblage 6: Uvigerina spp.  

One to 36 species are present in the samples, and the assemblage s show a deepening paleodepth downhole from an inner shelf settin g (Assemblages 1–3) to a middle to outer shelf setting (Assemblage s 3–5) and finally an outer shelf to upper bathyal/deeper setting (Assemblages 6 and 7). This overall deepening trend is intersperse d with horizons of transported shallow taxa (Assemblage 7). Preservation varies from very good to poor throughout the site and wa s affected by fragmentation, abrasion, and encrustation.  

# Geochemistry  

Site U1462 is characterized by low headspace gas concentrations. Relatively high calcium carbonate concentrations (up to 89. 4 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) are noted shallower than $845~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. At approximately 85 0 m CSF-A, a major drop in calcium carbonate content to $3.3\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ occurs, denoting the transition into the quartz-rich siliciclastics of th e Bare Formation (Wallace et al., 2003). Low TOC (mean value $=0.7$ $\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) and TN (mean value $=0.017\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ ) characterize the upper 84 5 m. As at previous Expedition 356 Sites U1459–U1461, high salinit y characterizes IW with a mean value of 123 and a maximum of 153. Elevated salinity at Site U1462, as well as a number of elementa l trends noted in the IW samples, appears to be related to the presence and dissolution of anhydrite. A zone of sulfate reduction is interpreted between $\mathord{\sim}300$ and $500\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetism investigations focused on NRM and AF demagnetization measurements. As core recovery and quality i n Holes U1462A and U1462C were poor, only archive-half section s deeper than $300\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A from Hole U1462C were measured usin g the SRM. However, stepwise AF demagnetization was conducte d for 24 discrete samples from Hole U1462A. Additionally, IRM acquisition and backfield IRM measurements were performed on fou r discrete samples from Hole U1462A (Samples 43X-1, $49{-}51\ \mathrm{cm}_{\cdot}$ , 54X-1, $38{-}40~\mathrm{cm}$ , 85X-2, $51{-}53\ \mathrm{cm}_{\cdot}$ , and 93X-1, $38{-}40~\mathrm{cm})$ ). Th e samples chosen are representative of sediments that yield high an d low MS values from the upper and lower parts of the hole. The samples that have low susceptibility (Samples 43X-1, $49{-}51~\mathrm{cm}$ , an d 93X-1, $38{-}40~\mathrm{cm}]$ ) exhibit SIRM patterns that indicate the presenc e of magnetite and/or titanomagnetite. The other two samples (54X$1,38–40\,\mathrm{cm}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and 85X-2, $51{-}53\,\mathrm{cm}]$ ) show higher SIRM values $(\sim\!700$ mT) and bimodal behavior, indicating higher coercivity and possibl y the presence of pyrrhotite. Remanent coercivity values of the fou r samples range between 46 and $58\,\mathrm{mT}$ . Sample 85X-2, $51{-}53\,\mathrm{cm}$ , wa s AF demagnetized after acquiring IRM, yielding a median destructive field of $40\;\mathrm{mT}$ . Bulk susceptibility measurements were also performed on all 24 discrete samples, and results ranged from $-6.88\;\times$ $10^{-6}$ to $48.05\,\times\,10^{-6}$ SI. AF cleaning procedures were followed b y principal component analysis (PCA) for discrete samples from Hol e U1462A, which indicated two different patterns: (1) low coercivit y from the top of the hole to ${\sim}504\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A and (2) higher coercivit y from ${\sim}580\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to the lowermost measured sample at $836.8\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. This suggests that AF demagnetization on the SRM up to 2 0 mT for archive-half sections (Hole U1462C) may not be sufficient t o fully reveal the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM ) deeper than ${\sim}580~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Examination of high-coercivity Component 2 data from the PCA of discrete samples from ${\sim}580\;\mathrm{m}$ CSFA to the bottom of Hole U1462A reveals steeper inclination value s than those observed for Component 1. These steeper inclinatio n values may not originate from a drilling overprint and may correlat e with the early part of the Matuyama Chron (C1r), although the wid e spacing between discrete samples means that the interpretation o f chron boundaries remains inconclusive. Magnetostratigraphic dat a for Hole U1462C clearly indicate a prominent bias of inclinatio n data toward positive values between Cores 356-U1462C-104R an d 114R $\langle{\sim}537.6{-}586.0\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) that, based on the biostratigraphi c datums of $3.54\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ( $565.6\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ ) and $3.70\;\mathrm{Ma}$ ( $584.7\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A), may be related to the upper part (Subchron C2Ar) of the Gilber t Chron.  

# Physical properties  

Physical properties measurements at Site U1462 were carrie d out using the WRMSL, NGR sensor, and discrete sampling. Becaus e of poor recovery, WRMSL and NGR data are scarce shallower tha n $300\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. However, deeper than $300\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, $60\%{-}70\%$ cor e recovery resulted in good coverage by these instruments. Betwee n 300 and $840~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, MS and NGR tend to be in phase and sho w $20{-}30\ \mathrm{m}$ scale variations, suggesting that they both reflect variations in clay input. Discrete $P.$ -wave measurements were taken i n three different ways: on section halves within the liner, on individual rock pieces, and on cut cubes that were subsequently analyzed fo r MAD. From the seafloor to $300\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ and from 850 to $950\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, which correspond to low recovery intervals where measurements were made on lithified fragments, $P$ -wave velocities are scattered and range up to ${\sim}5500~\mathrm{m/s}$ . The $P$ -wave velocities of man y MAD cube samples show that these rocks tend to have a high degree of anisotropy. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocities correlate well with porosit y and follow a power relation with bulk density. Grain densities obtained from MAD measurements correlate with grain densities estimated by XRD. Porosities in the packstones of lithostratigraphi c Unit II decrease from ${\sim}43\%$ at $300\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ to $27\%$ at $840\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A;}$ the rocks above this unit have variable porosities and those deepe r have variable but lower porosities. Thermal conductivity measure d in Hole U1462A increases with depth from about 1.3 to 2. 4 $\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K})$ at the bottom of the hole ${\sim}850\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A).  

# Downhole logging  

Downhole measurements in Holes U1462A and U1462C consisted of runs with the triple combo, FMS-sonic, and Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI) (Hole U1462C only) tool strings. Unfortunately, the MS data obtained during wireline logging were judged to be o f insufficient quality for interpretation. The NGR logs for both hole s are in agreement (Figure F12). In the upper $300\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , the wirelin e NGR log is the only available source of information on this sedimen t property, as core recovery was low (average $=4\%$ ). Deeper than 30 0 m WMSF, the NGR log shows good agreement with NGR data obtained on whole-round cores, with values ranging between 15 an d 60 counts/s (Figure F12). Many NGR peaks and troughs observed i n cores were also observed in the downhole log and were used fo r core-log correlation. This correlation indicates that the offset between wireline (WMSF) and coring (CSF-A) depth varies between  1 and $4\;\mathrm{m}$ . Wireline density and porosity measurements are generall y in good agreement with those measured on cores except for som e intervals with irregularities in the borehole diameter $(>\!16.7$ inches). Porosity decreases from $\sim\!50\%$ at $250~\mathrm{m}$ WMSF to $\sim\!30\%$ at $770~\mathrm{m}$ WMSF, whereas bulk density increases from 2.0 to $2.25\:\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in th e same interval. Where the log underestimates bulk density, it overestimates porosity in comparison to data obtained from discrete samples. FMS image quality is generally poor. However, around $625\mathrm{~m~}$ WMSF, there are horizontal lineations that were coherent betwee n the four sensing pads, and the character between the two logge d holes is similar. The spacing between these alterations ranges fro m several tens of centimeters to several meters, with thin (several ten s of centimeters) resistive layers interbedded within broader mor e conductive areas $\left(1{-}2\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ . Seismic properties were measured bot h with the FMS-sonic tool string and the vertical seismic profil e (VSP) obtained with the VSI. These two methods yielded sonic velocities that are in agreement with one another, suggesting that th e VSP experiment validated the absolute values of the velocities obtained with the FMS-sonic.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

A lithology resistant to piston coring in the upper ${\sim}300\,\mathrm{m}$ at Sit e U1462 required the use of the XCB (Hole U1462A) and RCB (Hol e U1462C) systems at the seafloor. Intervals of high recovery varie d with the coring system used, but, in general, recovery was poorest i n the upper $300\,\mathrm{m}$ . Recovery in Hole U1462A was relatively high fro m ${\sim}545$ to $585\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Cores 58X through 62X), ${\sim}635$ to $735\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Cores 69X through 86X), and ${\sim}820$ to $845\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Core s 94X through 98X), whereas the highest recovery intervals in Hol e U1462C were ${\sim}320{-}370\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Cores 62R through 71R), ${\sim}460-$ $775~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Cores 91R through 143R), and ${\sim}815{-}825\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF- A (Cores 151R through 153R). Unfortunately, within these higher recovery intervals, the cores do not overlap for more than a few meters at a time, so a detailed correlation could not be constructed. However, the wireline gamma ray logs, which correlate well to corebased NGR data, provide an excellent framework for developin g windows for high-resolution analyses in higher recovery intervals. For example, Cores 356-U1462A-36X through 40X overlap wit h Cores 356-U1462C-62R through 65R and 67R through 71R $(\sim\!325-$ $380\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A), Cores 356-U1462A-57X through 61X overlap wit h Cores 356-U1462C-101R through 109R ( $.{\sim}525{-}565\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A), an d Cores 356-U1462A-94X through 98X overlap with Cores 356- U1462C-148R through 157R $^{\prime}{\sim}800{-}840\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A).  

Sedimentation rates are moderate $(7{-}8\ \mathrm{cm/ky})$ in the Miocen e and increase to $24{-}31\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the early Pliocene (Figure F12). A n interval of reduced sedimentation rates is associated with the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary (the depth varies depending on the datums utilized). Very high $(70~\mathrm{cm/ky})$ sedimentation rates occur i n the early Pleistocene through at least Zone NN18 $(1.93\;\mathrm{Ma})$ , base d on calcareous nannofossil datums. Sedimentation rates are elevate d until the Late Pleistocene, when rates fall. However, the stratigraphic position of the Late Pleistocene datums is uncertain because of the limited recovery in this interval.  

# Site U1463  

Site U1463 is $\sim\!150\,\mathrm{~m~}$ from the Picard-1 Well $\mathrm{[41~m}$ wate r depth) on a flat outer ramp region (James et al., 2004) and $100~\mathrm{km}$ southwest of Site U1464. The seabed in the region is poorly sorte d carbonate-rich $(\mathrm{>}90\%)$ sediment made up of bioclastic gravel, sand, and mud (Jones, 1973; James et al., 2004). The wireline gamma ra y log data from the Picard-1 Well reveals high variability and an upward reduction interpreted to be related to subsidence, glacioeustatic sea level fluctuations, and climate variability from th e Pliocene to recent.  

The primary aim of coring Site U1463 was to obtain a Pliocene– Pleistocene tropical–subtropical carbonate record to allow us to determine the subsidence extent and rates and interglacial Australia n monsoon and tropical shelf-edge oceanographic histories of the region. An additional objective was to date a distinctive irregular seismic reflector postulated to be of Miocene age. Improving the ag e constraints on this feature will enhance regional seismic interpretations.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The lithostratigraphy of Site U1463 is divided into four unit s (Figure F13):  

• Unit I (Hol $\mathrm{:U1463A=9.07{-}13.98\;m}$ CSF-A, Hole $\mathrm{U}1463\mathrm{B}=0-$ 11.71 m CSF-A, Hole $\mathrm{U1463C}=0{-}14.31\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ , and Hole $\mathrm{U1463D}=0{-}15.40\;\mathrm{m}\;{\mathrm{CSF-A}}$ ) lithology is primarily unlithified creamy gray to light greenish gray wackestone and mudstone with abundant peloids. Macrofossils are abundant and diverse and include bivalves, gastropods, bryozoans, serpulids, echinoderms, pteropods, scaphopods, and small benthic foraminifers. Bioturbation is moderate but only occurs intermittently, and there are a few contact surfaces (e.g., gradational, bioturbated, and erosive). The bottom boundary of Unit I is defined by the disappearance of peloids in the sediment. • Unit II (Hole $\mathrm{U1463A}=13.98–18.29\;\mathrm{m}\;{\mathrm{CSF}}–\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ , Hole $\mathrm{U}1463\mathrm{B}=$ $11.71{-}112.40\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{C}$ SF-A, Hole $\mathrm{U1463C=14.31{-}112.11\,m\,C S F{-}A_{s}}$ , and Hole $\mathrm{U1463D}=15.40\mathrm{-114.30\;m\;CSF\mathrm{-A}})$ consists of wackestone, packstone, and mudstone intervals. Lithologic changes are also expressed as subtle color variations ranging from light greenish gray to creamy gray. Isolated macrofossils occur in darker coarse-grained wackestone and packstone intervals and include a diverse range of mollusks (gastropods, bivalves, and scaphopods), echinoderms, serpulids, and bryozoans. Bioturbation is slight in this unit, and few sedimentary and diagenetic features (gradational to sharp contacts and rare concretions) were noted. The top of Unit III marks the end of the creamy gray intervals in the alternating lithologies of Unit II. • Unit III (Hole $\mathrm{U1463B}=112.40{-}399.10\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, Hole U1463C $=112.11{-}392.49\;\mathrm{m}\;{\mathrm{CSF-A}},$ and Hole $\mathrm{U1463D}=114.30–352.80$ m CSF-A) predominantly consists of well-sorted homogeneous mudstone containing fine sand–sized grains and is divided into two subunits, IIIa (Hole $\mathrm{U1463B=112.40{-}305.81\;m\;C S F{-}A}$ and Hole $\operatorname{U1463C}=112.11-307.11\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) and IIIb (Hole $\mathrm{U1463B}=305.81{-}399.10\;\mathrm{m}\;{\mathrm{CSF-A}}$ and Hole $\mathrm{U1463C}=307.11-$ $392.49\mathrm{\;m\;CSF-A}_{,}^{\prime}$ ), based on a sharp increase in quartz content observed in smear slides. Visual core description for this unit indicates subtle changes in both color and bioturbation in an otherwise uniform moderately to heavily bioturbated mudstone with rare wackestone. Sedimentary features include rare wavy, sharp, scoured, and gradational contacts and sporadically preserved parallel lamination. Fossils include common small benthic foraminifers and bivalve fragments, and less common constituents include fragments of gastropods, bryozoans, echinoderm spines, crustaceans, scaphopods, barnacles, and worm tubes. Occasional concretions (celestite) occur lower in Subunit IIIa $(\sim\!150\!-\!250\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{}^{\$ CSF-A), with disseminated pyrite grains and nodules becoming common in Subunit IIIb. • Units IV and V were only recovered in Hole U1463B. The upper boundary of Unit IV (399.10–428.20 m CSF-A) is defined by the first occurrence of grainstone with abundant macrofossils

Gray bar $=$ casing depth; note the resulting dampened signal of the gamma log. Biostratigraphic zone boundary ages are shown. Age-depth model was produced fro m select biostratigraphic datums (see Table T6 in the Site U1463 chapter [Gallagher et al., 2017g]) (solid circles $=$ calcareous nannofossil, open circles $=$ planktoni c foraminifer). Sedimentation rates assume a linear sedimentation rate between datums. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages were smoothed to generate thi s synthesis, resulting in slight differences from data presented in hole summaries.  

![](images/c96182b8afc18f6b29eebd2b20aff8321aaea303fd8c90c1d5e4135d68877a6d.jpg)  

(mainly bivalve fragments). The unit is further characterized by an increased dolomite content as observed in both smear slides and XRD analyses.  

• Unit V $(428.20\mathrm{-}525.25\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ is creamy gray to light brown dolostone with sand-sized grains of pyrite and/or glauconite that occur in patches and as scattered grains throughout the matrix. Gypsum/anhydrite nodules, dissolution features, and fine vein structures characterize the dolostone. Both bioturbation and macrofossils are locally common, and bioclasts consist mainly of bivalves and occasional bryozoans and foraminifers.  

# Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology  

Site U1463 yielded a complete stratigraphic succession from th e early Pleistocene to late Miocene, with abundant and well-preserved calcareous nannofossils. The Pliocene/Pleistocene boundar y $.2.58\;\mathrm{Ma}$ ; within Zone NN16) is between 240.7 and $265.87\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF  

A, and the Miocene/Pliocene boundary $^{5.33}\mathrm{\Ma};$ within Zon e NN12) is between 345 and $379\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Planktonic foraminiferal abundance and preservation at Site U1463 is the best among all site s investigated so far during Expedition 356. Moderate to very goo d preservation is typical of the entire Pleistocene to Pliocene wit h common to abundant planktonic foraminifers between 7.78 an d $378.9\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Biostratigraphic marker species were identified fo r the Middle Pleistocene (0.61 Ma; top of G. tosaensis) at $46\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ , the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary below the top of $G$ . limbata $\mathbf{(2.39\,Ma}$ ; $220.54\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A), D. altispira $(3.47\mathrm{\:Ma};265.87\mathrm{\:m}\mathrm{\:CSF-A})$ ) for the Pliocene, and Sphaeroidinellopsis kochi (top at $4.53\,\mathrm{\:Ma}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; $334.71\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) for the early Pliocene. An extended interval that i s barren or contains heavily recrystallized foraminifers and very rar e nannofossils occurs deeper than $429.28\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to the bottom o f Hole U1463B ( ${\sim}525\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A). The lowermost biostratigraphic datum (nannofossils) suggests Sample 356-U1463B-48X-CC (412.4 4 m CSF-A) is older than 5.94 Ma (top of R. rotaria, Zone NN11) (Figure F13).  

Samples from Holes U1463A–U1463C contain between $10\%$ and $100\%$ benthic foraminifers with Cibicidoides spp. as the mos t common taxa. Five assemblages were identified based on benthi c abundances:  

• Assemblage 1: Quinqueloculina spp. and Textularia spp.   
• Assemblage 2: Operculina spp. and Amphistegina spp.   
• Assemblage 3: Cibicidoides spp., Rotalinoides gaimardii, and Lenticulina spp.   
• Assemblage 4: Pseudorotalia spp., Neoeponides spp., Planorbulinella larvata, and Bolivina spp.   
• Assemblage 5: Cibicidoides spp., Anomalinoides spp., and A. lessonii  

One to 43 species are present in the samples, and the assemblage s suggest paleodepths that start moderately deep (middle to oute r shelf; Assemblage 1) and continue to fluctuate between middle t o outer shelf and bathyal settings for the remainder of the site (Assemblage 3) with frequent downslope transported, diverse, shallowwater taxa within deeper foraminiferal assemblages (Assemblages 2, 4, and 5). Preservation was affected by fragmentation, abrasion, an d encrustation and varies from very good to poor throughout the sit e but is most frequently good to moderate with poor preservatio n only occurring from deeper than $390~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to the base of th e site.  

# Geochemistry  

At Site U1463, 56 samples were analyzed for headspace gas content, 25 samples $^{5-15}\,\mathrm{cm}$ whole rounds) for IW geochemistry, an d 25 samples for TOC, $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ and TN. IW samples were not collected in Holes U1463C or U1463D because these two holes recovered a section already sampled in Holes U1463A and U1463B. Onl y one sample was taken from Hole U1463A. In general, elevated salinity characterizes the site with a value of 35 at the top, increasin g gradually with depth to a value of 111 at the bottom ${\sim}525\mathrm{~m~}$ CSFA), with a mean value of 70. Similar to Site U1462, the high salinit y and a number of elemental trends in the IW samples appear to b e related to the presence and dissolution of anhydrite, which is present at the bottom of the section (lithostratigraphic Unit V; $428.20-$ $525.25\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ ). A number of elements exhibit increasing concentrations with depth, including sodium, chloride, barium, bromine, calcium, potassium, and sulfate. Site U1463 is characterized by lo w headspace gas concentrations, with methane concentrations ranging from 1.6 to 13.4 ppmv and almost no detection of higher molecular weight hydrocarbons. Further, this site is characterized by hig h $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content (mean value $=77.5\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ ), low TOC (mean value $=$ $0.7\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ), and low TN (mean value $=0.031\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ).  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetism investigations focused on NRM and AF demagnetization measurements. SRM results are reported from core s recovered with the APC and XCB coring systems from 0 to $390~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A from Holes U1463B and U1463C. A total of 11 discrete samples were taken from Holes U1463B and U1463C. IRM acquisitio n and backfield IRM measurements were performed for three discret e samples from Hole U1463B to determine the demagnetization behavior of sediment at this site. SIRM values exhibit a broad range. Two out of the three discrete samples exhibit SIRM at ${\sim}100{-}200$ mT; for one sample it was not possible to reach saturation in an impulse peak field of $1.2\ \mathrm{T}$ Remanent coercivity values of the thre e samples range between 35 and $75~\mathrm{mT}$ . One of the discrete sample s was chosen for AF demagnetization after IRM acquisition, yieldin g a median destructive field between 30 and $40\;\mathrm{mT}$ Bulk susceptibility measurements were also performed on all 11 discrete sample s from 282 to $311.96\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ , and results range from $-5.1\times10^{-6}$ t o $140.7\times10^{-6}\,\mathrm{SI}$ . These values exhibit an increasing trend that is similar to the equivalent measurements on the whole-round and spli t cores reported by the physical properties team.  

Archive-half sections from Holes U1463B and U1463C wer e measured on the SRM. In the upper two-thirds of Hole U1463B $\left(0-\right.$ $275\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}_{\prime}$ ), there is a steep negative inclination pattern when inclination values after AF cleaning up to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ are compared t o NRM values. From ${\sim}275$ to $290\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ , inclination values after 2 0 mT cleaning gradually become less steep and shift toward NRM values. The lower part of the core, from ${\sim}290\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ to the botto m of the succession, is characterized by inclination values that ar e hardly affected by AF cleaning up to $20\;\mathrm{mT},$ indicating the presenc e of a second, higher coercivity phase in that interval. The transitio n at ${\sim}290\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A could be related to lithologic changes from partially lithified mudstones to wackestones and the formation of iro n sulfide magnetic carriers, such as greigite $\mathrm{(Fe_{3}S_{4})}$ and pyrrhotit e $\left(\mathrm{Fe}_{1-\mathrm{x}}\mathrm{S}\right)$ , from alteration of disseminated pyrite. However, the demagnetization behavior of Sample 356-U1463B-37X-1, $86{-}88~\mathrm{cm}$ ( $311.96\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}_{.}^{\prime}$ ), clearly indicated that ChRM cannot be achieve d using the standard AF demagnetization step sequence (NRM, 10, and $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ ) for the deeper sediments $^{\prime}{\sim}270{-}390\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A). Therefore, demagnetization steps at NRM, 15, and $30~\mathrm{mT}$ were used i n this interval for Hole U1463C and produced a more accurate determination of ChRM, which was used for magnetostratigraphic interpretations. Magnetostratigraphic data for Hole U1463C indicate th e Gauss/Gilbert boundary $(3.596\;\mathrm{Ma})$ at ${\sim}282~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. In addition, it is possible that the transition between Subchron C3n and C3r intervals $(5.235\;\mathrm{Ma})$ is at ${\sim}375\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , where it corresponds with  a biostratigraphic datum of $5.59\,\mathrm{Ma}$ at ${\sim}392.5\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Figure F13).  

# Physical properties  

Physical properties measurements were performed using th e WRMSL, NGR sensor, and discrete sampling on cores. NGR measurements revealed similar trends and variations in all holes. M S values revealed $10{-}20\;\mathrm{m}$ scale variability, with maximum amplitud e (about 30 SI) from 270 to $330\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. MS patterns are consisten t between holes and between the WRMSL and SHMSL. Variability a t the $10{-}20\,\mathrm{~m~}$ scale is also observed in NGR and $P$ -wave velocit y measured on the WRMSL, which was verified through discret e measurements. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity increases from about 1500 to 190 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ in the top $300\;\mathrm{m}$ of the site. From 300 to $390\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, discret e measurements of $P$ -wave velocity show diverging trends betwee n Holes U1463B (cored by the XCB system) and U1463C (cored b y the HLAPC system), suggesting that coring methods impact thi s sediment property. Porosity decreases from $64\%$ to $40\%$ at $250\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A and is scattered with a range of $13\%{-}43\%$ deeper than $270\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

# Downhole logging  

Downhole measurements were conducted in Hole U1463B. Th e triple combo tool string was run between $452\textrm{m}$ WMSF and th e seafloor and was used to measure borehole width, NGR, bulk density, porosity, resistivity, and MS. In the upper part of the borehole, NGR increases with depth in a stepwise manner with steps at $\mathord{\sim}78$ and ${\sim}110\;\mathrm{m}$ WMSF, the first of which corresponds to the end of th e drill pipe (Figure F13). Between 110 and $200\;\mathrm{m}$ WMSF, NGR show s strong meter-scale variability and ranges between 30 and 8 0 counts/s. At $208~\mathrm{m}$ WMSF, a prominent peak in NGR is observed. Between 210 and $385\mathrm{~m~}$ WMSF, NGR remains relatively high an d ranges between 30 and 60 counts/s. The wireline NGR log is in goo d agreement with core-based NGR and allows for correlation of wireline and core data. MS measurements were affected by changin g borehole temperatures and were judged to be of insufficient qualit y for interpretation. Wireline bulk density and porosity measurements correspond to the results of discrete core sampling in most o f the logged interval. $P$ -wave sonic velocities measured with th e FMS-sonic tool string from 444 to $122\mathrm{~m~WMSF}$ are consistentl y higher than sonic velocities measured on cored material. However, the same $20{-}30\,\mathrm{~m~}$ scale variability in sonic velocity is present i n both wireline logs and core-based measurements. Although borehole diameter was relatively large ${\sim}16$ inches), FMS images ar e generally of good quality with both passes yielding consistent images. From ${\sim}443\mathrm{~m~WMSF}$ upward, the FMS shows $20{-}50\;\mathrm{cm}$ wid e horizontal resistive bands with diffuse edges about $5\,\textrm{m}$ apart. Deeper than ${\sim}406\mathrm{~m~}$ WMSF, there are occasional sharp bands o f high conductivity with thicknesses $<\!5\ \mathrm{cm}$ . Uphole from ${\sim}380\,\mathrm{~m~}$ WMSF, these thin conductive bands become more prevalent an d some have the appearance of being tilted from the horizontal b y ${<}20^{\circ}$ .  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Site U1463 was triple cored using the APC, HLAPC, and XC B systems in order to recover a complete and continuous section. Th e stratigraphic correlators provided coring guidance to ensure recovery gaps between holes did not overlap and to determine the dept h at which the mudline core was taken for the second and third AP C holes. Correlation was possible for the upper ${\sim}350\,\mathrm{~m~}$ betwee n Holes U1463B, U1463C, and U1463D, and a splice of the upper 30 0 m was generated from the correlation. Variability in lithology an d coring methods between holes caused some uncertainty in the correlation, which is based on the sediment physical properties data. Uncertainty was also introduced by a downhole switch from an MSbased correlation to a NGR-based correlation.  

Sedimentation rates are generally high at this site, well abov e typical pelagic values. Specifically, sedimentation rates are moderate through the Pliocene and increase $(11{-}19\,\mathrm{cm/ky})$ ) in the Pleistocene  (Zone  NN18/NN19  boundary  to  Biozone  PT1a/Pt1 b boundary) before declining to moderate levels $(5\,\mathrm{cm/ky})$ in the Middle Pleistocene to recent.  

# Site U1464  

At $270\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth, Site U1464 is currently in an outer ram p setting (James et al., 2004) approximately $50~\mathrm{km}$ southeast of th e Rowley Shoals. The seabed in the vicinity of the site is poorly sorted, carbonate-rich $(>\!90\%)$ ) sediment made up of bioclastic gravel, sand, and mud (Jones, 1973; James et al., 2004). Site U1464 is $5\,\mathrm{km}$ updi p from a drowned “fossil” reef/shoal described by Jones (1973) an d Ryan et al. (2009) and connected to the site by parallel laterally persistent seismic reflectors. Therefore, improved ages for these reflectors may allow us to date the initiation and demise of this reef/shoal. The proximity of Site U1464 to a previously identified drowne d shoal makes this site unique and significant: stratigraphic data an d paleobathymetric determinations obtained will allow robust estimates of the subsidence history of this part of the NWS and its rol e in carbonate platform drowning. As the most northern site of th e Expedition 356 coring transect, the sediment and biota at Sit e U1464 are likely to record strong Western Pacific Warm Pool an d  

ITF signals vital to understanding the history of these importan t oceanic features. The strata of this site were also targeted for a Pliocene–Pleistocene record of the Australian monsoon and aridity.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The lithostratigraphy of Site U1464 is divided into five unit s (Figure F14). The unit boundaries were defined using visual cor e description, smear slide observations, NGR data, XRD, and thi n section analyses from Holes U1464B–U1464D:  

• Unit I (Ho $\mathrm{ie\U1464B=0{-}44.10\ m\ C S F{-}}$ A and Hole $\mathrm{U1464D=}$ $0{-}43.00\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ ) is $43\mathrm{-}44\mathrm{~m~}$ thick and consists of unlithified creamy gray sediments with coarse silt– to fine sand–sized peloids in varying abundances, with the last occurrence of peloids marking the base of the unit. The sediment is mainly skeletal grainstone in the upper part, mudstone dominating the middle and lower part of the unit, and thin interbedded packstone and wackestone intervals. The generally low siliciclastic content of the unit is dominated by mica with minor amounts of quartz. The unit contains abundant foraminifers and pteropods with some macrofossils (e.g., scaphopods, bivalves, and solitary corals).   
• Unit II (Hole $\mathrm{U1464B}=44.10\mathrm{-138.20\;m\;CSF-}$ A and Hole $\mathrm{U1464D}=43.00{-}140.39\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ ) is ${\sim}95\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and consists mainly of unlithified, homogeneous wackestone that includes a packstone interval and a relatively high abundance of authigenic glauconite and glauconitized microfossils. The top of the unit is defined by the loss of peloids as a common sedimentary component. Macrofossils are sparse and concentrated in coarser grained intervals. Bioturbation is slight to moderate throughout the unit. Disseminated pyrite grains are common in the lower part of the unit along with occasional pyrite nodules and celestite concretions. Siliciclastic content generally increases but is variable, particularly in the lower half of the unit.   
• Unit III (Hole $\mathrm{U1464B}=138.20{-}308.86\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CS}$ F-A and Hole $\mathrm{U1464D}=140.39\mathrm{-308.74\;m\;CSF\mathrm{-A}}$ ) is ${\sim}170\;\mathrm{m}$ thick, with the top of the unit marked by a transition from wackestone to mudstone, a decrease in sand-sized siliciclastic content, and an increase in clay-sized sediment. Overall siliciclastic content is very fine grained in Unit III, with a near absence of coarse-grained material. The unit consists mainly of unlithified grayish green to greenish gray homogeneous mudstone with moderate bioturbation and common disseminated pyrite and pyrite concretions. Macroscopic bioclasts are very sparse, but microfossils are abundant and well preserved with a marked increase in calcareous nannofossils noted in smear slides.   
• Unit IV (Hole $\mathrm{U1464B}=308.86{-316.95\:\mathrm{m\:C}}$ SF-A, Hole U1464C $=308.00{-}521.40\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}_{x}$ , and Hole $\mathrm{U1464D}=308.74–523.97$ m CSF-A) is ${\sim}215\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and marked by a transition to dolomitic packstone. The unit consists of three main intervals of dolomitic limestone separated by two intervals of skeletal limestones. Gypsum nodules are common in the dolomitic intervals and commonly co-occur with anhydrite nodules in the lower 46 m of the unit. Karstic surfaces, cavities, and moldic porosity are also common, especially in the skeletal limestones. Macrofossils are present and diverse in both lithologies, often occurring as molds. Bioclasts include many organisms typical of shallow habitats, including larger benthic foraminifers (e.g., Cycloclypeus), some zooxanthellate corals, and crustose coralline algae. Siliciclastic material is generally absent in Unit IV.   
• Unit V (Hole $\mathrm{U1464C}=521.40{-}832.90\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ is $311.50\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and consists primarily of dolomitic limestones (mudstone,

Magnetic polarity i s shown in black and white (gray $=$ uncertainty in the data) (see Paleomagnetism in the Site U1464 chapter [Gallagher et al., 2017h]). Biostratigraphic zon e boundary ages are shown. Age-depth model was produced from biostratigraphic datums only (see Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology in the Sit e U1464 chapter [Gallagher et al., 2017h]) and assumes a linear sedimentation rate between datums (solid circles $=$ calcareous nannofossil, open circles $=$ planktonic foraminifer). Sedimentation rates are calculated separately for calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers where the datums diverge. Note th e break in scale for the age-depth model. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages were smoothed to generate this synthesis, resulting in slight differences from dat a presented in hole summaries.

wackestone, packstone, and grainstone) and dolostone. The top of the unit is defined by the first occurrence of littoral deposits. The upper part of the unit $\left(\sim\!100\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ contains several heavily dolomitized intervals, whereas the lower part $\left(\sim\!55\,\mathrm{m}\right)$ is composed of lithified increasingly coarser packstones and grainstones. Macrofossils include fragments of mollusks, echinoid spines, bryozoans, and LBFs. Macrofossil content generally decreases toward the base of the hole, whereas bryozoans increase in abundance and become common in the lower $10\,\mathrm{m}$ . Siliciclastic content continues to be generally absent to low with angular sand-sized quartz noted in the lowermost interval.  

# Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology  

Site U1464 yielded a complete stratigraphic succession from th e early Pleistocene to late Miocene, with usually abundant and wellpreserved  calcareous  nannofossils.  The  Pliocene/Pleistocen e boundary $(2.58\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ; within Zone NN16) is placed between 97.4 2 and $108.29\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, and the Miocene/Pliocene boundary (5.3 3  

Ma; within Zone NN12) is placed between 228.4 and $293.15\;\mathrm{m}$ CSFA. Planktonic foraminiferal abundance and preservation at Sit e U1464 is moderate to good for the entire Pliocene–Pleistocene wit h common to abundant planktonic foraminifers between 2.26 an d $293.2\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Biostratigraphic marker species were identified fo r the Middle Pleistocene $(0.61\ M\mathrm{a};$ ; top of $G.$ . tosaensis) at $11.51\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary below the top of $G.$ . limbata $\mathrm{2.39\,Ma}$ ; $88.17\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A), $D_{\ast}$ altispira (3.47 Ma; 126.3 m CSFA) for the Pliocene, and S. kochi (top at $4.53\ \mathrm{Ma};\,272.57\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{CSF-A})$ for the early Pliocene. An extended interval that is barren or contains heavily recrystallized foraminifers and very rare nannofossil s occurs deeper than $347.08\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ to the bottom of Hole U1464 C (832.9 m CSF-A), corresponding to the barren interval from 328.5 2 m CSF-A to the bottom of Hole U1464D (523.97 m CSF-A). Th e lowermost biostratigraphic datum is a benthic foraminifer, whic h suggests the material in Section 356-U1464C-43R-2 (707.57 m CSFA) is older than $12.8\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (top of Nephrolepidina ferreroi TF1-2 [Renema, 2007]) (Figure F14).  

Samples from Site U1464 contain between $6\%$ and $100\%$ benthi c foraminifers, with Cibicidoides spp. as the most common taxa. Fou r assemblages can be identified based on benthic abundances:  

• Assemblage 1: Textularia spp.   
• Assemblage 2: Lenticulina spp., Clavulina subangularis, Neoeponides spp., and Pseudorotalia spp.   
• Assemblage 3: Amphistegina spp., Elphidium spp., and Operculina spp.   
• Assemblage 4: Cibicidoides spp.  

One to 43 species are present in the samples, and the assemblage s suggest paleodepths that start relatively deep (inner to outer shel f [Assemblage 1]) at the bottom of the site ( ${\sim}833\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) and the n deepen (outer shelf to upper bathyal [Assemblage 2]) until aroun d 300–310 m CSF-A. Beginning from this depth, paleodepth rapidl y shallows (inner to middle shelf [Assemblage 3]) and then deepen s again (inner to outer shelf [Assemblage 4]). Preservation was affected by fragmentation, abrasion, encrustation, and infilling an d varied from very good to poor throughout the site but was most frequently good for Assemblages 1 and 2 and poor for Assemblages  3 and 4.  

# Geochemistry  

At Site U1464, 85 samples were analyzed for headspace gas content, 20 samples $(5{-}15\,\mathrm{cm}$ whole rounds) for IW geochemistry, an d 23 samples for TOC, $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3},$ and TN. In general, Site U1464 is characterized by the lowest headspace gas concentrations of all of th e Expedition 356 sites, with methane ranging from 0 to 3.2 ppmv an d almost no detection of higher molecular weight hydrocarbons. Elevated salinity characterizes the site with a value of 35 at the top an d increasing gradually with depth to 105 at the bottom, with a mea n value of 68. Similar to Sites U1462 and U1463, high salinity at Sit e U1464 and a number of elemental trends noted in the IW sample s appear to be related to the presence and dissolution of anhydrite, which was observed in lithostratigraphic Units IV and V. A numbe r of elements exhibit increasing concentrations with depth, includin g sodium, chloride, barium, bromine, calcium, potassium, and sulfate. The majority of samples at this site are characterized by high $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content (mean value $=78.8\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ ) and low TOC (mean value $=0.6$ $\mathrm{wt\%})$ ) and TN (mean value $\,=\,0.018\,\mathrm{\,~wt\%}$ ). However, there are tw o samples from black layers in Sections 356-U1464C-24R-2 and 25R2 that have extremely low $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ content (3.6 and $2.7\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) but different characteristics in TOC and TN values. The sample at $523~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Section 24R-2) contains low TOC $(0.77\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ and TN (0.03 4 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ ), similar to samples from other depths. In contrast, the slightl y deeper sample at $532\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A (Section 25R-2) has much highe r TOC $(1.94\mathrm{~wt}\%)$ and TN $(0.079\mathrm{~wt}\%)$ ), suggesting that, despite appearing visually similar, these black layers represent different depositional environments.  

# Paleomagnetism  

A total of 20 discrete samples were taken from Holes U1464B– U1464D. IRM acquisition and backfield IRM measurements wer e performed for four selected discrete samples (356-U1464B-18H4W, $74{-}76~\mathrm{cm}$ , 24H-3W, $70{-}72~\mathrm{cm}$ , 356-U1464C-22R-4W, 50–5 2 cm, and 34R-1W, $46{-}48~\mathrm{cm}$ ) chosen according to the observed demagnetization behavior throughout the site. Two samples (356- U1464C-22R-4, $50{-}52\;\mathrm{cm}$ , and 34R-1, $46{-}48~\mathrm{cm}$ ) reached SIRM a t ${\sim}100~\mathrm{mT}_{\mathrm{}}$ , Sample 356-U1464B-24H-3, $70{-}72\;\mathrm{cm}_{:}$ , saturated at ${\sim}400$ mT, whereas Sample 18H-4, $74{-}76~\mathrm{cm},$ , did not reach saturation i n fields up to $1.2\ \mathrm{T}$ . Remanent coercivity values of the four sample s range between 44 and $83\,\mathrm{\mT}$ . Bulk susceptibility measurement s were also performed on all of the discrete samples, and results rang e from $-7.95\times10^{-6}$ to $110.24\times10^{-6}\;\mathrm{SI}$ .  

Archive-half sections from Hole U1464D were measured on th e SRM to construct the magnetostratigraphy. Resulting intensity values generally range from $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}_{:}$ , with exceptions betwee n $\mathord{\sim}158$ and $180\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Cores 356-U1464D-18H through 22H) an d between ${\sim}245$ and $293\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Cores 27H through 32H), fo r which intensity values reach ${\sim}10^{-1}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ . A persistent negative inclination trend exists from the top of the succession to ${\sim}210\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF- A (Core 23H), from which there is a gradual shift toward lower inclination values and more frequent positive inclination intervals. Magnetostratigraphic data for Hole U1464D indicate the Gauss/Gilber t boundary $(3.596\ \mathrm{Ma})$ at ${\sim}282\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. In addition, it is possibl e that the Subchrons $C3\mathrm{n}/C3\mathrm{r}$ boundary $(5.235\mathrm{~Ma})$ occurs betwee n 272.66 and $277.85\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A because it can be constrained by a biostratigraphic datum of $5.59\,\mathrm{Ma}$ at $281.39\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Figure F14).  

# Physical properties  

Stratigraphic overlap between Holes U1464B–U1464D is confirmed by physical properties patterns, including MS, NGR, an d MAD results. Detailed analysis of $P$ -wave velocity, as measured i n sediments obtained within an interval where three different corin g techniques (APC, XCB, and RCB) overlap, reveals some significan t results related to coring and measurement techniques. $P$ -wave velocities measured on XCB and APC cores show parallel trends. However, XCB $P$ -wave velocities fall within two distinct velocit y ranges. The lower range is similar to $P$ -wave velocities obtained o n APC cores and corresponds to the “gravy” portion of the XCB core. A second range is ${\sim}150~\mathrm{m/s}$ higher and corresponds to the “biscuits.” Sediments obtained during RCB coring tend to have 400–65 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ higher velocities than those obtained during APC coring. Evaluation of differences between MAD and GRA bulk densities suggests that the differences are a result of mineralogical variations. This is because MAD measurements incorporate mineralogical differences, whereas GRA bulk density estimates assume constan t mineralogy throughout. An estimate of the geothermal heat flux o f $59.1\;\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ was derived from a combination of the six in situ temperature estimates and core-based thermal conductivity measurements.  

# Downhole logging  

Downhole measurements were conducted in Hole U1464C wit h the triple combo tool string. The deployment of the tool string consisted of a down pass ( $\scriptstyle0-783\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{WMSF}$ ) and an up pass between 78 3 and $615\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{WMSF}$ At $615\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{WMSF}$ on the up pass, the tool becam e stuck in the hole, probably due to hole cave in, and considerable effort was undertaken to retrieve the tool. We thus canceled planne d operations with the FMS-sonic and VSI. Wireline NGR data obtained during the down pass with the triple combo were in agreement with core-based data. Between 84 and $305\;\mathrm{m}$ WMSF, wirelin e NGR ranges between 25 and 55 American Petroleum Institut e gamma radiation units (gAPI) and the variability in this interval i s the result of variability in K and Th, whereas the signal from U i s subdued. In the underlying interval, between 305 and $747\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{WMSF},$ NGR ranges between 15 and $40\,\mathrm{gAPI}$ and the variability is primaril y the result of variations in U, rather than variation in K or Th, both o f which show generally low concentrations. Downhole MS measurements were affected by temperature and were judged to be of insufficient quality for interpretation. Wireline bulk density and porosit y measurements were only carried out in the interval between 76 4 and $617\textrm{m}$ WMSF during the up pass. The wireline bulk densit y measurements in this interval generally agree with core-base d MAD results. Wireline porosity measurements, on the other hand, agree with MAD results only in the intervals between 680 and 72 0 m WMSF and between 735 and $755\;\mathrm{m}$ WMSF.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Site U1464 was cored to ${\sim}840\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ using a combination o f the APC, XCB, and RCB systems. The upper ${\sim}300\mathrm{~m~}$ was doubl e cored with the APC system (Holes U1464B and U1464D) and  a strong correlation was produced using the NGR data. The correlation was extended to ${\sim}320\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A with overlap between the AP C (Hole U1464B) and XCB systems (Hole U1464D) but is less certai n because of recovery gaps and biscuiting in the XCB cores. A splic e could not be created because there were only two holes in the uppermost sections, but most paleoceanographic studies can use th e sampling guidance of the correlation, particularly because sedimentation rates are elevated $(17\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ in the expanded early Pliocen e section that ranges from $\sim\!320$ to $180\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Holes U1464 B and U1464D (Figure F14).  

Sedimentation rates are not well constrained for the Miocen e interval; three datums were determined over $500\;\mathrm{m}$ of low core recovery (Figure F14). However, if deposition was continuous between the LBF datum at $707.57\:\mathrm{~m~}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ and the nannofossi l horizon at $552.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (see Figure F38 in the Site U1464 chapte r [Gallagher et al., 2017h]), then rates were in the range of 25–3 0 $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ (the LBF datum represents the youngest possible age, so i f the horizon is older, sedimentation rates would be lower). Sedimentation rates increase from ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the lowermost Pliocene t o $17\,\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{ky}$ in upper Zone NN12–NN13 and Zone NN14–NN15, an d continue at moderate rates $(5{-}8~\mathrm{cm/ky})$ through the remainder o f the Pliocene (Zone NN16) and into the Pleistocene. Upper Pleistocene (Zone NN19–NN21) rates are similarly low $(2{-}4\mathrm{~cm/ky})$ bu t differ depending on the biostratigraphic group.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

The shipboard results successfully addressed or exceeded eac h of the proposed objectives, as discussed below. The high quality o f material recovered, despite intermittent core recovery in some sections, and the complete documentation of its geological and geophysical context guarantees an unparalleled series of future studie s by the expedition scientific party as well as many other scientist s over the coming decades.  

1. Determine the timing and variability of the ITF, Indo-Pacific Warm Pool, and onset of the Leeuwin Current to understand the controls on Quaternary extratropical carbonate and reef deposition.  

At ${\sim}29^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , Sites U1458–U1460 (Figures F1, F15) in the Perth Basin are close to the Houtman-Abrolhos reef system, the most southerly reef complex in the Indian Ocean (Collins et al., 1993). Th e high-latitude position of these reefs is directly related to the path o f the south-flowing warm Leeuwin Current, which is itself controlle d by the relative intensity of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and ITF variability. Strong seabed cementation prevented Site U1458 from sampling the Quaternary strata of this region, and coring was therefor e transferred to the alternate Site U1459. Sites U1459 and U146 0 yielded an extended Miocene to Quaternary upper slope to oute r shelf carbonate section that will allow, for the first time, investigation of the timing and relative influence of the Leeuwin Curren t (and the ITF) on the initiation and evolution of reefal developmen t on the Rottnest shelf and Carnarvon ramp system (Collins et al., 2014). Further microfossil and geochemical research on the recor d at Site U1460 (Figure F16) is likely to show the relative influence o f the colder, more nutrient enriched West Australian Current (Well s and Wells, 1994) versus the Leeuwin Current through critical periods in the Pleistocene such as the Middle Pleistocene Transitio n (MPT).  

Sites U1461 and U1462 (Figures F1, F15) in the NCB are near  a series of drowned reefs at ${\sim}22^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ . The purpose of drilling these site s was to obtain an in situ record of ITF connectivity over the last 5 M y and determine the timing of reef development. Both sites yielde d well-constrained biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic age s and detailed well logs (Figure F17), including both downhole lo g and core-based sonic velocity data (Figure F18). These data will allow regional seismic profiles to be calibrated in detail for the firs t time and enable dating of reflectors beneath these reefs, thereb y constraining their onset. Because Site U1464 in the Roebuck Basi n is updip from a drowned shoal (Ryan et al., 2009), drilling has revealed a detailed biochronostratigraphic framework with which t o date the initiation and demise of this “failed” Rowley Shoal (Figur e F1). Horizons of Indo-Pacific benthic foraminifers were common i n Pliocene–Pleistocene strata at Sites U1461 and U1462, as well as a t Sites U1463 and U1464 farther north and may also be present in th e Pleistocene strata of southern Sites U1459 and U1460. The relativ e abundance of these biogeographically significant Indo-Pacific foraminifers (Figure F16) is related to intermittent ITF connectivit y (Gallagher et al., 2009). Furthermore, the modern distribution o f some of these taxa extends to Cape Leeuwin (at ${\sim}34^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ ; Li et al., 1999) and is related directly to the path of the warm Leeuwin Current. Similarly, the spatial and temporal distributions of biogeographically  important  Indo-Pacific  macrofossils  (corals  an d mollusks), ostracods, and dinoflagellates reflect ITF connectivity. Detailed studies of the abundance of all of these fossils will she d light on the secular variations in ITF connectivity over the last 5 My. Studies on the distribution of these fossil groups in the Miocen e shallow-water strata cored at Site U1464 will improve our knowledge of the biogeographic consequences of ITF restriction at ${\sim}10$ Ma, preceding the onset of the ITF connectivity near the base of th e Pliocene (Kuhnt et al., 2004).  

Previous work (Gallagher et al., 2014b) has shown that marin e ooids are present in the strata adjacent to Sites U1461 and U1462. Their presence indicates that shallow-water, carbonate–supersaturated, arid, tropical conditions prevailed during the Pleistocene i n the region. However, their ages and regional stratigraphic settin g are not well constrained, because they were present only in cutting s from sparsely sampled petroleum industry wells (Gallagher et al., 2014b). Expedition 356 coring has revealed Pleistocene ooids a t Sites U1461 and U1462. Further analyses will constrain the ages o f these key tropical indexes and enhance our understanding of th e onset of aridity and reef development in northwestern Australia.  

2. Obtain an ${\sim}5$ My orbital-scale tropical to subtropical climate and ocean archive, directly comparable to deep-ocean oxygen isotope and ice-core archives, to chart the variability of the Australian monsoon and the onset of aridity in northwestern Australia.  

There are no well-constrained orbital-scale climate records beyond 500,000 y (Kawamura et al., 2006; van der Kaars et al., 2006 )  

![](images/dab7a080ed697466d52fbd7f53ab056400676ae62543505e38a494e15b86c8b3.jpg)

along the entire western margin of Australia. To address this gap i n our understanding, Sites U1458–U1460 were targeted to obtain a  5 My record of the southern Australian winter-dominated rainfall regime of Australia. The more northerly sites (U1461–U1464) wer e targeted to reveal the equivalent record of the summer rainfall– dominated Australian monsoon for this period. All sites lie on th e shelf or upper slope and it was anticipated that these “proximal” records would preserve more continent-derived siliciclastics (Figure s F19, F20) compared to the more distal deeper oceanic ODP an d Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) sites in the Indian Ocean nearby.  

Because Sites U1459 and U1460 yielded a sequence of Miocen e to Quaternary shelf to upper bathyal carbonates, further researc h on the clay mineralogy and pollen record of the thick $\left(270\,\mathrm{m}\right)$ highrecovery $(98\%)$ Pleistocene section at Site U1460 is likely to yield a  2 My orbital-scale climate record of the winter-dominated rainfall regime (Figure F17). When combined with similar research on th e high-recovery Pliocene record at Site U1459, this will greatly increase our understanding of how Australia’s subtropical to war m temperate climate responded to Pliocene warmth through to th e MPT and onset of Late Pleistocene to recent icehouse conditions.  

Site U1461 yielded the thickest sequence of Pliocene to Pleistocene strata obtained during this expedition $\left\lfloor1000\,\mathrm{m}\right\rfloor$ . This, togethe r with its excellent recovery $(83\%)$ and the very good preservation o f the calcareous microfossils within these strata, means that it is potentially one of the best sampled paleoceanographic and climate archives along the western continental margin of Australia. Anothe r archive with excellently preserved calcareous microfossils wa s cored at Site U1463. The only other comparable records to thes e sites in this region are the deep oceanic archives from DSDP Sit e 214 and ODP Site 763A (see Karas et al., 2009, 2011). The very goo d preservation of foraminifers (Figure F21) in the Pleistocene (Sit e U1463) and Pliocene (Sites U1461 and U1463) is likely to facilitat e orbital-scale paleoceanographic and paleoclimate reconstruction s using stable $C/\mathrm{O}$ isotopes and $\mathrm{Mg/Ca}$ analyses. Results from Sit e U1463 also suggest organic biomarker analyses may be successfull y applied to this section. The combination of inorganic (elemental/isotopic) and organic geochemical analyses of Site U1463 i s likely to reveal an unparalleled 5 My record of oceanic condition s immediately downstream of the ITF.  

There are significantly more siliciclastics in the Pliocene strat a compared to the Pleistocene at Sites U1461–U1464 (Figures F17, F19). Analyses of the pollen content, clay mineralogy, and other siliciclastic content (such as dust) at these sites will reveal variations i n terrestrial input directly associated with the relative strength of th e Australian monsoon over the last 5 My and the switch to more ari d conditions during the Pleistocene. The presence of anhydrite in th e underlying Miocene strata at Sites U1462–U1464 suggests tha t drier, more arid conditions prevailed before Australian monsoon intensification during the Pliocene and has led to elevated salinities i n the pore waters in the overlying sediment (Figure F22).

Figure F16. A. Summary of benthic foraminiferal assemblages for each site, Expedition 356. Ages were determined from biostratigraphy. Benthic foraminifera l assemblages were smoothed to generate this regional synthesis, resulting in slight differences from data presented in both hole and site summaries (see eac h site chapter for more detail). (Continued on next page.)  

3. Provide empirical input into the spatiotemporal patterns of subsidence along the NWS that can be used to place fundamental constraints on the interaction between Australian plate motion and mantle convection and to ground truth geodynamic models.  

Coring a latitudinal transect of seven sites from $29^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ to $18^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ ha s provided a well-constrained stratigraphic framework (Figures F1, F15) that will allow construction of a series of high-resolution subsidence curves. Such analyses will draw on the detailed physica l properties data from both laboratory and wireline logging measurements of such lithology-dependent properties as density an d porosity. These data will be combined with age models and paleobathymetry from each site. Paleobathymetric estimation will follo w a holistic approach involving benthic foraminiferal assemblage s (Figure F16), planktonic percentage, and sedimentary facies, further enhanced using estimates from larger foraminifer distribution s and consideration of seismic geometries.  

Calculation of 1-D water-loaded basement subsidence historie s at each site assuming Airy isostasy should be sufficient for our purposes. The abundance of industry seismic profiles near several o f the sites would enable flexural backstripping, but the low flexural rigidity of the region in light of the apparent long-wavelength character of the subsidence renders this degree of complexity unnecessary.  Expedition  356  coring  provides  well-defined  records  o f paleobathymetry (Figure F16), sediment compaction parameters, and lithology (Figure F15) for the last 5 My. Such parameters ar e also needed for the underlying sedimentary units, whose compaction accounts for a large component of the accommodation space, but these data are available from the nearby commercial wells.  

Construction of subsidence curves along our latitudinal transec t will constrain the spatial and temporal patterns of vertical motion s caused by the interaction between plate motion and convectio n within the Earth’s mantle, known as dynamic topography. The NW S is an ideal location to study this phenomenon because it is positioned on the fastest moving continent since the Eocene, on th e edge of the degree 2 geoid anomaly. Accurate subsidence analyse s over $10^{\circ}$ of latitude can resolve whether northern Australia is moving with/over a time-transient or long-term stationary downwellin g within the mantle, thereby vastly improving our understanding o f deep-Earth dynamics and their impact on surficial processes.
