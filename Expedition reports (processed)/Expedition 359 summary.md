# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 359 was designed to address changes in sea level and currents, along with monsoon evolution in the Indian Ocean. The Maldives archipelag o holds a unique and mostly unread Indian Ocean archive of th e evolving Cenozoic icehouse world. Cores from eight drill sites in th e Inner Sea of the Maldives provide the tropical marine record that i s key for better understanding the effects of this global evolution i n the Indo-Pacific realm. In addition, the bank geometries of the carbonate archipelago provide a physical record of changing sea leve l and ocean currents. The bank growth occurs in pulses of aggradation and progradation that are controlled by sea level fluctuation s during the early and middle Miocene, including the mid-Miocen e Climate Optimum. A dramatic shift in development of the carbonate edifice from a sea level–controlled to a predominantly currentcontrolled system appears to be directly linked to the evolving Indian monsoon. This phase led to a twofold configuration of ban k development: bank growth continued in some parts of the edifice, whereas in other places, banks drowned. Drowning steps seem t o coincide with onset and intensification of the monsoon-related current system and subsequent deposition of contourite fans and largescale sediment drifts. As such, the drift deposits will provide a continuous record of Indian monsoon development in the region of th e Maldives.  

A major focus of Expedition 359 was to date precisely the onse t of the current system. This goal was successfully completed durin g the expedition. The second important outcome of Expedition 35 9 was groundtruthing the hypothesis that the dramatic, pronounce d change in style of the carbonate platform sequence stacking wa s caused by a combination of relative sea level fluctuations and ocea n current system changes. These questions are directly addressed b y the shipboard scientific data.  

In addition, Expedition 359 cores will provide a complete Neogene $\delta^{13}{\cal C}$ record of the platform and platform margin sediment s and a comparison with pelagic records over the same time period. This comparison will allow assessment of the extent to which platform carbonates record changes in the global carbon cycle an d whether changes in the carbon isotopic composition of organic an d inorganic components covary and the implications this has on th e deep-time record. This determination is important because such records are the only type that exists in deep time.  

# Introduction  

Changes in oceanic circulation and sea level, along with onse t and fluctuations of the Indian monsoon, characterize the Neogene. Located in the Indian Ocean, the Maldives carbonate edifice bear s the tropical marine record of these changes. The archipelago i s characterized by a double row of atolls encompassing a basin, th e Maldives Inner Sea, connected to the open ocean through passages. The Maldives Inner Sea has served as a depositional center of current-controlled deposits (i.e., drifts) since the partial drowning o f parts of the carbonate edifice during the middle Miocene. This sedimentary system of drowned platform parts and drifts was the target of International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expeditio n 359, which aimed to reconstruct its paleoceanographic evolutio n over the past 26 My. The approach of Expedition 359 was to reconstruct this evolution from the combined physical record provide d by the seismic data, the lithologic record in the neritic and hemipelagic deposits, and the chemical proxies within the sedimentar y column. This reconstruction was achieved by drilling eight site s aligned into two transects covering shallow to deep-water deposits. Sites U1465, U1466, U1468, U1469, and U1470 were drilled to recover a sedimentary sequence encompassing a carbonate platfor m to drift succession (Oligocene to Pleistocene) (Table T1; Figures F1, F2, F3). Sites U1467, U1471, and U1472 recovered a Miocene t o Pleistocene carbonate drift succession. The expedition built on a series of seismic data sets that image the different steps of carbonat e platform evolution (R/V Meteor Cruise M74/4 NEOMA and $\mathrm{R}/\mathrm{V}$ Sonne Cruise SO236 MALSTROM) and previously drilled Ocea n Drilling Program (ODP) Site 716 (Leg 115) (Backman, Duncan, e t al., 1988).

Ocean. The Maldives carbonate platform consists of 22 atolls on the Laccadive–Maldives Ridge, a volcanic ridge that formed when the Indian plat e moved over the Réunion hotspot.  

# Geological setting of the Maldives  

The Maldives archipelago in the central equatorial India n Ocean is an isolated tropical carbonate platform edifice constitutin g the central and largest part of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge, locate d southwest of India (Figure F4). A north-south–oriented double ro w of atolls encloses the Inner Sea of the Maldives (Figure F5). Interatoll channels that deepen toward the Indian Ocean separate th e atolls from each other. The Inner Sea is a basin with water as deep a s $550\mathrm{~m~}$ . The Maldives carbonate succession accumulated since th e Eocene, away from any terrigenous input (Aubert and Droxler, 1992; Purdy and Bertram, 1993).  

The modern archipelago comprises about 1200 smaller atoll s that lie near or slightly above the sea surface. Discontinuous marginal rims formed by such small atolls surround lagoons with wate r depths to $50{-}60\ \mathrm{m}$ . These rims are interrupted by deep passages, allowing strong currents within the atoll lagoons to rework and redeposit sediment and influence the growth of patch reefs (Ciarapic a and Passeri, 1993; Betzler et al., 2015). Modern marginal reefs ar e composed of robust-branching corals and coralline algae, wherea s the lagoonal reefs show domal corals and detrital sand and rubbl e facies (Gischler et al., 2008). Muddy sediments are present only i n atoll areas that are protected by large marginal reefs (Ciarapica an d Passeri, 1993; Gischler, 2006; Betzler et al., 2015).  

The oceanward margins of the Maldives archipelago are generally steeply inclined, with dips of $20^{\circ}{-}30^{\circ}$ to $2000\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth. O n the Inner Sea side, terraced atoll slopes have the same dip angles bu t reach water depths of only $150\ \mathrm{m}$ , where the gradient rapidly declines (Fürstenau et al., 2010). The Inner Sea is characterized b y periplatform ooze deposition that locally accumulates into sediment drift bodies (Droxler et al., 1990; Malone et al., 1990; Betzler e t al., 2009, 2013a, 2013b; Paul et al., 2012; Lüdmann et al., 2013).  

The climate and oceanographic settings of the Maldives are dictated by the seasonally reversing Indian monsoon system (Tomcza k  

![](images/f2788b5e62584e719ba022fa3e4fcc7464d13fc122df009d97c81668780fd449.jpg)  
and Godfrey, 2003). Southwestern winds prevail during Norther n Hemisphere summer (April–November), and northeastern wind s prevail during winter (December–March). These winds generat e ocean currents that are directed westward in the winter and eastward in the summer. Interseasonally, a band of Indian Ocean equatorial westerlies are established, enforcing strong eastward-flowin g surface currents with velocities up to $1.3\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . Currents reach wate r depths of $200\,\textrm{m}$ and more with only slightly reduced velocitie s (Tomczak and Godfrey, 2003). Within the modern atolls’ passages, currents can exhibit velocities up to $2\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ at the surface (Preu an d

Figure F6. Sketch of the Maldives carbonate platform stratigraphy (after Betzler et al., 2013a). The volcanic basement is overlain by Eocene and Oligocen e neritic carbonates. During the Oligocene, the platform areas shrank and two north-south–trending carbonate banks developed. During the Miocene, shallowwater carbonate banks partly drowned, whereas other platform areas grew further on. Contemporaneously, the carbonate platform was affected by an intensification of currents, as registered by the onset of widespread drift sedimentation in the Inner Sea of the Maldives. The research strategy for Expedition 35 9 was to drill two transects of sites from the inner part of the drowned platforms toward the Inner Sea, coring the platforms and the drifts.

Engelbrecht, 1991), accounting for winnowing in the passages an d lagoons, where hard bottoms form (Ciarapica and Passeri, 1993; Gischler, 2006; Betzler et al., 2015).  

The Maldives formed on a lower Paleogene $(60{-}50\,\mathrm{Ma})$ volcani c basement (Duncan and Hargraves, 1990) (Figure F6). The longterm subsidence rate of the Maldives is roughly $0.03{-}0.04\ \mathrm{mm/y}$ based on deep core data from Well ARI-1 (Aubert and Droxler, 1996; Belopolsky and Droxler, 2004a). In contrast, sedimentologica l data from the Rasdhoo atoll indicate a much faster subsidence rat e since the last interglacial, with a maximum subsidence rate of 0.1 5 $\mathrm{mm/y}$ during the past 135,000 y (Gischler et al., 2008).  

# Lower to middle Miocene  

The Maldives comprises an approximately $3\;\mathrm{km}$ thick shallowwater carbonate succession (Belopolsky and Droxler, 2004a) (Figur e F6). Carbonate production was established during the early Eocen e when flat-topped carbonate banks began to form on topographi c highs created by the volcanic basement during the Eocene to earl y Oligocene. During the late Oligocene, bank margins typically ha d elevated rims that separated bank-interior areas from the ope n ocean. During the early Miocene, carbonate production became restricted to narrow bands at the respective most oceanward areas, forming the double row of platforms. During the Miocene, platfor m margins prograded toward the Inner Sea, as recognized in differen t versions of seismic reflection data, irrespective of seismic resolutio n (Purdy and Bertram, 1993; Aubert and Droxler, 1996; Belopolsk y and Droxler, $2004{\mathrm{a}}$ ; Betzler et al., 2009, 2013a).  

Eleven seismic sequences are recognized in the lower and middle Miocene platform strata of the Maldives (Betzler et al., 2013a ) (Figures F7, F8; see TRANSECTS in Supplementary material). These sequences are interpreted to have formed in response to se a level–driven accommodation space variations (Betzler et al., 2013a). Platform sequences (PS) PS1–PS6 show development from a shallow ramp to a steep-flanked, reef-rimmed carbonate platform. Bank-edge reefs protect the lagoon where back-reef aprons occur. At the PS6–PS7 transition, a switch from dominantly aggrading t o dominantly prograding bank margins occurs. PS7–PS10 are composed of deposits formed in response to forced regression and ar e overlain by deposits formed during reflooding of the bank margins.  

# Middle Miocene to Pleistocene  

The upper middle Miocene is characterized by the appearanc e of large-scale lobate clinoform bodies, attesting to the onset of current-controlled deposition in the Inner Sea (Figures F7, F8) (Betzle r et al., 2013a; Lüdmann et al., 2013). These bodies are attached t o passages where some platforms drowned while remaining bank s and atolls grew elsewhere (Betzler et al., 2009, 2013a). Lobes are fe d by easterly currents and reworked by a current system flowin g obliquely or normally to this main stream (Betzler et al., 2013a). This current pattern filled the Inner Sea from west to east (Lüd

mann et al., 2013). Starting with drift sequence (DS) DS6, the opening of a southern gateway introduced northward flow of botto m water into the Inner Sea, leading to deposition of giant elongate d drifts at the eastern flank of the basin, filling it from east to wes t (Betzler et al., $2013\mathbf{a}$ ; Lüdmann et al., 2013).  

Two additional drowning steps affected the Maldives (Betzler e t al., 2009, 2013a). Flat-topped and atoll-shaped banks are interprete d to have drowned quickly, whereas mound-shaped banks are interpreted to have undergone sequential drowning under elevated nutrient fluxes (Betzler et al., 2009), similar to banks described b y Zampetti et al. (2004) offshore Malaysia. The drowned banks ar e elongated parallel to the extension of the Kardiva Channel, which i s characterized by throughflow of monsoon-driven surface current s (Betzler et al., 2009). This shape is interpreted as reflecting curren t control, similar to the recent atolls that are elongated because of th e action of waves and currents (Purdy and Bertram, 1993).  

# Partial drowning steps triggered by currents  

An increase in sediment flux into the Indian Ocean occurre d around 11 Ma (Rea, 1992; Zheng et al., 2004), and a peak in the sedimentation rates of the Indus Fan took place between 16 and $10\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Clift et al., 2008). Onset and monsoon-intensification steps correlate with the Maldives partial drowning steps (Betzler et al., 2013a). Marine records suggest onset of monsoonal-triggered marine upwelling at ${\sim}8.5~\mathrm{Ma}$ (Kroon et al., 1991). It is therefore proposed that monsoon-driven currents and local upwelling shape d the atolls in the past, controlling sediment production and ree f growth. Thus, the timing of partial platform drowning and monsoon evolution is linked. Under monsoon conditions, upwelling injected nutrients into surface waters, affecting the carbonate bank s (Betzler et al., 2009). This process caused the demise of the barrie r reef system, which was replaced by a string of current-shaped relic t reefs separated by passages accommodating the throughflow of currents (Betzler et al., 2009, Lüdmann et al., 2013).  

# Site summaries Site U1465  

# Background and objectives  

One goal of Expedition 359, in addition to retrieving the recor d of the Neogene sea level changes in the prograding Kardiva platform and the onset of the monsoon-related currents in drift deposits, was to establish the time and cause of the drowning of th e Kardiva platform during the middle Miocene. Platform drowning– related questions were the focus of Site U1465, which is situate d above the margin of the drowned Kardiva platform that is overlai n by $70\,\mathrm{m}$ of sediment. It is the westernmost site of a four-site transec t that runs from west to east in the Kardiva Channel. Site U1465 (proposed Site MAL-01A) is located at $4^{\circ}55.9873^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $73^{\circ}0.6786^{\prime}\mathrm{E},$ , in  a water depth of $512.64\mathrm{~m~}$ between the Goidhoo and South Maalhosmadulu atolls (Figure F5).  

Carbonate platforms are the only depositional system that ca n cease to exist. The mechanism of the platform demise is usuall y drowning,  but  the reason(s)  for  drowning  is  still  unresolve d (Schlager, 1981). Many processes have been proposed, such a s global anoxic events, tectonic breakup, and excess nutrients (Arthu r and  Schlanger,  1979;  Hallock  and  Schlager,  1986;  Philip  an d Schlager, 1990; Eberli, 1991). The close relationship between platform drowning and intensification of ocean currents has been proposed for the demise of the Miocene platforms on the Mario n Plateau (Isern et al., 2004; John and Mutti, 2005; Eberli et al., 2010).  

Betzler et al. (2009, 2013a) and Lüdmann et al. (2013) documen t partial platform drowning in the Maldives and propose that, in th e Maldives, the drowning of the platforms is the combined product o f current activity and nutrient supply. Examining the drowning unconformity and the pre- and postdrowning succession in regard t o their age, composition, and diagenetic overprint was intended t o provide evidence to link drowning directly to the onset of the monsoon-related current system and the concomitant excess nutrien t supply from upwelling.  

# Principal results  

At Site U1465, three lithostratigraphic units were identified i n the mostly unlithified drift deposits and the underlying lithifie d platform and slope sediments of the Kardiva platform (Figure F2) . Unit I contains unlithified white/light gray to gray-brown and pal e yellow packstone to grainstone and, locally, rudstone. The components are planktonic and benthic foraminifers, pteropods, red algae, Halimeda plates, bivalves, echinoid fragments and spines, otoliths , and rare solitary corals. Aggregate grains, yellow to brown grains, and black grains occur throughout the entire unit. All lithoclast s and some bioclasts are abraded, which is expected in this drift deposit. The underlying Unit II comprises a shallow-water platfor m margin facies with diverse coral fauna. The top of Unit II is welllithified floatstone with corals, red algae, large benthic foraminifers, bivalves, and serpulid fragments that show evidence of exposur e and  subsequent  submarine  hardground  formation.  This  thi n drowning layer is partly dolomitized and silicified and contain s large molds with two generations of dark-colored geopetal infilling s that are likely phosphatic (Figure F9). Below this top layer, coral boundstone and floatstone that can be rich in algal nodules alternate. Unit III consists of alternating lithified, very pale brown, coarse-grained dolomitic grainstone to packstone with varying degrees of cementation. The composition is similar to the matrix o f the overlying floatstone, but fragments of massive and branchin g corals decrease and red algae and large benthic foraminifers increase. Other main components are large benthic foraminifers, bivalves, Halimeda plates, bryozoa, echinoid spines, gastropods, an d abundant bioclasts (Figure F10). Unit III displays all the characteristics of a proximal slope facies, which fits the seismic facies that consists of steeply inclined reflections.  

A robust age model was produced by combining the biostratigraphic data of the planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils in the ${\sim}70\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick drift sediment succession recovered i n Hole U1465A above the drowned platform. In the platform and th e underlying slope section, the occurrence of planktonic foraminifer s and nannofossils was not sufficient for biostratigraphic purposes. The $70\textrm{m}$ thick drift sediments range in age from Late Pleistocen e to early Pliocene and consist of pelagic faunal elements, fragments, well-preserved echinoderm spine fragments, and fish teeth. All samples contain reworked shallow-water benthic foraminiferal taxa, indicating a range from reefal to middle neritic environments.  

Interstitial water (IW) sampling was limited to the uppermos t $70\;\mathrm{m}$ (i.e., the drift sediments overlying the platform) at Site U146 5 by lithification and poor recovery. Concentrations of major anion s and cations generally remain constant and close to mean seawate r values throughout the sampled interval. For example, $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ concentrations range between 422 and 433 and 10.9 and $11.2\;\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{3}}$ respectively, with no trends visible with increasing depth. Similarl y stable values are reflected in $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ and $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ concentrations, and salinity also remains relatively constant at 34.5–35 throughout th e measured interval. This general lack of variation could result fro m

three possible situations: no significant diagenesis, high rates of advection, or contamination by seawater.  

The lack of geochemical variation contrasts with the mineralogical changes shown by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data, which reflect carbonate diagenesis during the burial of sediment at Sit e U1465. Above 45 meters below seafloor (mbsf), the sediment consists of $30\%{-}80\%$ aragonite, $6\%{-}18\%$ high-Mg calcite (HMC), an d the remainder low-Mg calcite (LMC). From 45 to 85 mbsf, dolomit e is as high as $7\%$ , and aragonite and HMC continue to make up $30\%-$ $60\%$ of the sediment (Figure F11). Thus, it is possible that the rate o f advection dilutes the geochemical signal of diagenesis in the IW. I n the carbonate platform portion, carbonate mineralogy is variable. Below 90 mbsf, the rocks are essentially composed of LMC and dolomite, but below 160 mbsf, aragonite is again present at abundances of ${<}10\%$ . Quartz is often present in the XRD spectra but i s never a significant component of the sediment $(<\!1\%)$ .  

Petrophysical analyses differentiate two physical propertie s units. The first unit encompasses the loose Pliocene–Pleistocen e drift sediments and has high porosities. The lower unit correspond s to the platform carbonates, characterized by higher $P$ -wave velocities and higher densities.

Seismic stratigraphy at Site U1465 shows excellent correlatio n with lithostratigraphic units (Figure F12). The hiatus separating th e platform top from the drifts encompasses DS1–DS6, is biostrati  

graphically dated at Site U1465 as middle Miocene to middle Pliocene (i.e., ${\sim}12{-}3.5\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ), and corresponds to the boundary betwee n lithostratigraphic Units I and II. The upper part of PS11 at Sit e U1465 consists of a package of gently basinward-dipping reflection s that can be laterally traced over a distance of around $600\mathrm{~m~}$ . Th e lower boundary of the package coincides with sequence boundar y PS11, which corresponds to the base of lithostratigraphic Unit II. The deepest hole at Site U1465 (Hole U1465C) was abandoned approximately $9\,\mathrm{m}$ above the basal boundary of PS10.  

# Site U1466  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1466 is positioned at $4^{\circ}55.9880^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $73^{\circ}1.6894^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ , in a wate r depth of $518\mathrm{~m~}1880\mathrm{~m~}$ east of Site U1465 (Figure F5). The site is i n front of the last prograding clinoform of the drowned carbonat e platform that was the target of Site U1465. In this basinal position,  a thick drift succession overlays the bottom- and foresets of th e drowned Kardiva platform. The pulses of progradation are relate d to sea level changes, and the overlying drift succession is a currentcontrolled system that is likely related to the Indian monsoon (Belopolsky and Droxler, $2004{\mathrm{a}}$ , 2004b; Betzler et al., 2013a, 2013b; Lüdmann et al., 2003). The main goals of this site were (1) to dat e the transition from the sea level–controlled platform system to th e current-controlled drift deposition and (2) to establish an age model for the early and middle Miocene sea level changes in the India n Ocean and the changes in current evolution since the middle Miocene. The mid-Miocene to recent drift succession contains several sequences caused by fluctuations in the current system (Lüdman n et al., 2013). Dating these sequence boundaries will provide ages o f changes in strength and direction of the currents and potentiall y serve as a proxy for changes in monsoon intensity. Dating of th e platform sequence boundaries will provide ages of the sea level lowstands in the Indian Ocean that together with data sets from the Bahamas (ODP Leg 166) and offshore eastern Australia (ODP Leg s 133 and 194) will allow testing of the global synchroneity of Neogene sea level changes (Betzler et al., 2000; Eberli et al., 2002, 2010). In addition, the age of the last platform sequence will provide th e timing of the platform drowning that potentially is linked to the onset of the current system. Site U1466 cores will also address anothe r objective of Expedition 359: the periplatform sediments deposite d at this site offer the opportunity to retrieve a complete record o f $\delta^{13}{\cal C}$ though the lower and middle Miocene that, together wit h other Expedition 359 sites, will provide another data set of the carbon isotopic record that is needed to calibrate the periplatform platform margin record against the pelagic record (Swart, 2008).  

# Principal results  

The sedimentary succession at Site U1466 penetrated $803.6~\mathrm{m}$ of lower Miocene to Pleistocene carbonates. This succession consists of a $254~\mathrm{m}$ thick package of drift deposits overlying a $549\mathrm{~m~}$ thick succession consisting of the bottomsets and foresets of th e middle Miocene prograding platform. Seven lithostratigraphic unit s were identified in the succession (Figure F2). Lithostratigraphi c Unit I through Subunit IVC (0–248.3 mbsf) is from the sedimen t drift, Subunit IVD through Unit VI (248.3–715.34 mbsf) contain s the lithologic record of the prograding tongues of the Kardiva platform, and Unit VII (715.34–803.61 mbsf) is composed of lowe r Miocene basinal carbonates from the Inner Sea.  

Unit I is Pleistocene to recent in age and consists of an unlithified coarse-grained grainstone succession. The gray-brown to pal e yellow carbonate sand consists almost exclusively of bioclasts, an d planktonic foraminifers are the most abundant component, wit h

admixtures of benthic foraminifers, pteropods, otoliths, Halimeda plates, echinoid spines, bryozoa, and bivalves. The bioclasts ar e generally broken and show signs of abrasion indicative of curren t transport.  

Unit II is an alternation of unlithified packstone and grainstone, ranging in grain size from very fine to coarse. The main components are planktonic foraminifers and minor benthic foraminifers, pteropods, red algae, Halimeda plates, bivalves, echinoid fragment s and spines, and otoliths. Aggregate grains, yellow to brown staine d grains, and black grains occur throughout the entire unit. Unit II I consists of very pale brown medium- to coarse-grained grainston e to packstone that is variably lithified. The main components ar e planktonic foraminifers, with common to present benthic foraminifers (e.g., Lepidocyclina), encrusting red algae, Halimeda plates, an d bryozoan fragments. Lithification increases downhole to lithifie d rocks at 99.53 mbsf; below this depth, unlithified and lithified intervals alternate again.  

Unit IV consists of four subunits based on the occurrence of textural changes from wackestone to packstone and/or grainstone. Th e overall lithology is similar throughout the entire unit and consists o f skeletal and foraminiferal wackestone to packstone (Figure F13). Unit V is marked by the occurrence of large benthic foraminifers i n light gray to light brownish gray, lithified, medium- to coarsegrained dolomitic grainstone and packstone. Unit VI is characterized by a significant increase in the degree of bioturbation that consists of an alternation of decametric intervals of lithified fine- t o medium-grained packstones and wackestones with common planktonic and benthic foraminifers, echinoid fragments, and bioclasts. Unit VII consists of an alternation of well-laminated black interval s with massive white chalk and gray-green intervals with moderate t o abundant bioturbation (Figure F14). The top of the unit contains intervals with slumps, soft-sediment deformation features, and turbidites.  

The age model for Site U1466 (Figure F15) relies on the combination of planktonic foraminifer (Figure F16) and calcareou s nannoplankton datums. The estimated sedimentation rate for th e Pliocene–Pleistocene sequence is ${\sim}1.4~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ . Most of the uppe r Miocene strata are absent at this site. The hiatus occurs between th e

last occurrence (LO) of Coronocyclus nitescens $(12.12\;\mathrm{Ma})$ and th e LO of Globoquadrina dehiscens $(5.92\;\mathrm{Ma})$ . The middle Miocene i s divided into two intervals; the basal one presents a moderately hig h sedimentation rate $({\sim}4.4\,\mathrm{cm/ky})$ , whereas the upper interval is characterized by a very high sedimentation rate $({\sim}17.1\,\mathrm{cm/ky})$ . The earl y Miocene is divided into two intervals according to the preservatio n of microfossils, although the sedimentation rate does not chang e through those intervals and remains the same as values in the basa l middle Miocene $({\sim}4.4\;\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{ky})$ .  

Pore water studies at Site U1466 in the upper 85 mbsf indicat e either relatively low rates of organic matter remineralization o r rates of advection by bottom seawater that are faster than the rate s of decomposition of organic matter. The concentration of aragonit e remains relatively high throughout the Pleistocene and Pliocene $\left(0-\right.$ $85\,\mathrm{mbsf}]$ ), reflecting either variation in the input from adjacent platforms during changes in sea level or diagenetic change to LMC. Although the hypothesis that aragonite is not being neomorphosed i n the upper 85 mbsf is supported by the absence of large increases i n the concentration of $S\ensuremath{\mathbf{r}}^{2+}$ in the pore fluids, the possibility also exist s that relative high rates of fluid advection remove evidence of dissolution and precipitation reactions. Below 85 mbsf, aragonite disappears, and at 97.7 mbsf, the sediment contains up to $70\%$ dolomite. Downhole, dolomite content decreases again and up to $20\%$ aragonite is present. Below 320 mbsf, dolomite disappears and is onl y barely detectable in trace concentrations through the remainder o f the core (Figure F17).  

The determination of paleomagnetic polarity based only on inclination data for Site U1466 is extremely weak because of the ver y low paleolatitude, possible inclination anomalies due to a nondipol e field, and poor data quality. Nevertheless, paleomagnetic studie s tentatively identify 21 magnetozones using the inclination data. These magnetozones are tentatively attributed to the lower an d middle Miocene (C5A–C5E series and C6).  

The variability of values in the downhole logs and the measure d petrophysical properties (Figures F18, F19) in the pure carbonat e strata of Site U1466 reflect changes in diagenesis/lithification an d the amount of organic carbon rather than mineral composition. Grain density is similar throughout the entire section. $P.$ -wave velocity does not correlate well to porosity and displays abrupt increase s and decreases downcore, as is typical in pure carbonates. Downhol e logging was limited to one run with the modified triple combo too l string to $345\,\mathrm{~m~}$ wireline log depth below seafloor (WSF) becaus e the hole collapsed. In the pure carbonate succession, natural gamm a radiation (NGR) is low with two higher peaks related to increase d organic carbon content. Resistivity most likely records the degree o f cementation, with better-cemented intervals having higher resistivity.

The correlation of the lithostratigraphy and age model from biostratigraphy to the seismic stratigraphy confirms and refines th e predrilling interpretation (Figure F19). The continuous seismic reflections of the distal clinoforms of the sea level–controlled Kardiv a platform are lithologically a regular alternation of intervals of lithified fine- to medium-grained packstones and wackestones. Thes e alternations are most likely the result of high-frequency sea leve l changes. The onset of the drift succession is recorded by a change i n seismic and lithologic facies. Seismic reflection amplitudes decrease, and the lithology is dominated by coarse-grained packston e and grainstone, reflecting a current-dominated sedimentation pattern.  

flowing through the Kardiva Channel. Dating these sequenc e boundaries will provide the ages of changes in strength and direction of the currents. Further linking of these physical stratigraphi c data with postexpedition sedimentological and geochemical dat a will address the question of changes in the monsoon intensit y (Kroon et al., 1991; Prell et al., 1992; Clift et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2015). Moreover, the periplatform sediments deposited at this sit e offer the opportunity to retrieve a complete record of $\delta^{13}{\cal C}$ throug h the middle Miocene that, together with the other Expedition 35 9 sites, will provide another data set of the carbon isotopic record tha t is needed to calibrate the periplatform record against the pelagic record.  

# Site U1467  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1467 is the easternmost site drilled in the Inner Sea of th e Maldives during Expedition 359. It is located at $4^{\circ}51.0274^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ $73^{\circ}17.0223^{\prime}\mathrm{E},$ at a water depth of $487.4~\mathrm{m}$ (Figure F5). This site i s positioned on a $630~\mathrm{m}$ thick succession of drift deposits lining th e southern flank of the Kardiva Channel. The main objectives wer e (1) to precisely date the onset of the drift deposition and to constrain the timing of sequence boundaries in the drift succession; (2) to analyze the cyclostratigraphy of carbonate drift deposits, providing reconstructions of changes in the current regime and monsoon cyclicity; and (3) to recover an undisturbed sedimentar y sequence for further paleoceanographic studies.  

The mid-Miocene to recent drift succession contains several sequences that are likely caused by fluctuations in the current syste m  

# Principal results  

Five holes were drilled at Site U1467, one of them (Hol e U1467E) as a dedicated logging hole. The sediment recovered a t Site U1467 is a fine-grained succession of wackestone to packstone. Compositional changes are minor, but alternation of lighter an d darker intervals of variable thickness persists downhole, eve n through the increasing degree of lithification to approximately 64 0 mbsf. Six lithostratigraphic units were differentiated (Figure F2).  

Unit I $\mathrm{(0{-}110.0~m b s f)}$ consists of unlithified, foraminifer-ric h wackestone to packstone with a predominance of very fine- to finegrained wackestone. The unit is characterized by thick $(30{-}100\,\mathrm{cm})$ to very thick $^{\left/}{>}100\right.\mathrm{cm})$ intervals defined by color changes rangin g from light gray to grayish brown. The dark colored intervals correlate with low lightness $L^{\ast}$ reflectance values and display an invers e

Unit II (110–215 mbsf) is defined by interlayered unlithified an d partially lithified planktonic foraminifer–rich wackestone and mudstone with pteropods and particulate organic matter. The matrix o f the sediment contains calcareous nannofossils and sponge spicules.

Unit III (215–303 mbsf) consists of partially lithified very fine grained mudstone to wackestone with a dominance of wackestone. The unit also has thick to very thick packages with color changes, from light gray to light olive-gray and light brownish gray. The sediment contains abundant planktonic foraminifers; echinoid spine s and sponge spicules are common, but benthic foraminifers are rare. Celestine nodules and fragments, bioclasts, and particulate organi c matter are common, especially in the darker intervals.

As with previous units, particulate organic matter i s present and changes in abundance, which is linked to color variations from light gray to light brownish gray and pale yellow wit h gradational and commonly bioturbated contacts. Ichnofauna consist of Thalassinoides, Planolites, Zoophycos, Chondrites, and Palaeophycus.  

Unit V (498.5–607 mbsf) still consists of planktonic foraminifer–rich wackestone to packstone with alternating light and dar k intervals, but lithostratigraphic Unit VI below 607 mbsf lacks dar k layers within the fine-grained wackestone.  

Biostratigraphic analyses show an apparently continuous succession of Holocene to middle Miocene age recovered at Site U146 7 (Figure F20) that is divided into three intervals. The Pleistocene an d upper Pliocene extends from the seafloor to $\mathord{\sim}130$ mbsf. Throughout  this  interval,  planktonic  foraminifers  are  well  preserved, whereas benthic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils are well preserved at the top but moderately well preserved below 40 mbsf. The lower Pliocene and much of the upper Miocene extends fro m $\mathord{\sim}130$ to 540 mbsf. Preservation throughout this thick interval i s poor to moderate for all microfossils, except in the deepest core i n this interval (Core 359-U1467B-69X), from which very well preserved nannofossils were recovered from a few darker, probabl y clay-rich levels. The late Miocene and later part of the middle Miocene extends from 540 to 714 mbsf.  

Decreases in $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ concentrations and alkalinity in the interstitial fluid geochemistry from Site U1467 indicate that significan t remineralization of organic material occurred below 50 mbsf. A n odor of $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ was also noted upon core recovery and squeezing of th e whole-round samples, suggesting that bacterial sulfate reductio n probably accounts for the observed trend. As large amounts of $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ are released during decomposition of sedimentary organic matter,  a negative correlation between $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ and $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ is also related to th e oxidation of organic matter. $C1^{-}$ increases from the sediment surfac e to around 100 mbsf (Figure F21) and may be related to the last glacial period, when salinity was altered as a result of Northern Hemisphere glaciation.  

Site U1467 sediments contain up to $60\%$ aragonite in the uppe r $50\,\mathrm{m}$ of the core. Below 50 mbsf, aragonite content decreases to les s than $10\%{-15\%}$ and drops to less than $10\%$ by 500 mbsf. This decrease is interpreted to reflect aragonite dissolution, based on increases of $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ concentrations in the pore fluids. Deposits are agai n richer in aragonite between 500 mbsf and the bottom of the hole; $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ concentrations of the pore fluids decrease slightly in this interval, whereas $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ concentrations increase. There are several occurrences of celestine $\left(\mathrm{SrSO_{4}}\right)$ between 163 and 393 mbsf, indicatin g that the pore water concentrations of $S\ensuremath{\mathbf{r}}^{2+}$ and $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ attain supersaturation with respect to this mineral.  

Organic carbon content in Site U1467 sediments fluctuates between 0 and $12\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ , with the samples richest in organic carbon a t 89, 112, and 168 mbsf. Methane remains at concentrations betwee n 1.6 and 12.0 ppmv, increasing slightly from the surface to 300 mbs f and then remaining mostly stable around 5 ppmv with some scattering of values. Ethane is only present in measurable quantities (\~ 1 ppmv) between 249 and 277 mbsf and at 324, 580, and 706 mbsf.  

Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) analysis at Site U146 7 was only possible on limited core sections because of pervasive contamination, presumably from rust in the drill pipe that affected th e first two to three sections of every core, despite cleaning the dril l pipe interior while in Hole U1467C. Nevertheless, a series o f magnetozones between ${\sim}100$ and 200 mbsf in Hole U1467C and between 195 and 255 mbsf in Hole U1467B were identified and interpreted as Chrons C2Ar to $C3\mathrm{n}.3\mathrm{n}$ (Figure F20). Another series o f possible normal and reversed polarity intervals based only on th e analysis of inclinations, which are less than $20^{\circ}$ and consistent wit h the paleolatitude for this site, was recognized between 580 and 71 4 mbsf in Hole U1467C (Cores 24X–37X) and interpreted to b e Chrons C5n.2n to C5An.2n.  

The physical properties of the sediment reflect the rather monotonous nature of the lithologic succession at Site U1467, which i s mainly characterized by the changes of color from darker to lighte r intervals in generally fine-grained bioturbated wackestone. Belo w 465 mbsf, where the formation is more lithified, density and velocit y increase significantly and show large variations. High-frequenc y fluctuations in NGR also follow color variations, which are likel y produced by small admixtures of organic material (dark color) an d more early marine cements (light color). In addition, NGR data display five longer term variations that loosely follow the lithostratigraphic units. Magnetic susceptibility is low throughout the entir e core.  

In the dedicated logging Hole U1467E, three tool strings wer e deployed: the triple combo, Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI), and Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic tool strings. The VSI tool strin g recorded good sonic waveforms at 13 stations at a $50\,\mathrm{m}$ interval. After shore-based processing, logging data were analyzed and divide d into four logging units. Logging unit boundaries correlate wit h some of the lithostratigraphic units (Figure F22). Most variations i n the downhole logs are seen in the gamma ray values, triggered b y differences in the uranium content, which correlate to variations i n the amount of organic matter as revealed by smear slide analysis. VSP data and sonic velocity logs helped to establish the conversio n between depth and two-way traveltime (TWT) and thus allowed u s to exactly tie in seismic and core data.  

Stratigraphic correlation using available biostratigraphic an d paleomagnetic age control points allowed us to refine and establis h a precise age model for Site U1467 that correlates the differen t physical property measurements and the downhole logging data.  A composite depth scale and splice at Site U1467 were constructe d from 0.0 to $220.25\;\mathrm{m}$ core composite depth below seafloor (CCSFD) (from the “mudline” in Hole U1467C to the bottom of Core 359- U1467B-22H).  

In the seismic profiles, the drift sequences at Site U1467 are represented by well-stratified, nearly horizontal, low- to medium-amplitude reflections and in the lower part by a succession of stron g reflections. Site U1467 is located in a basinal position where all sequence boundaries appear as continuous parallel reflections, whic h are the correlative conformities to the unconformities along the basin margin that define the sequence boundaries. The thickness o f the drift sequences varies from $24.5~\mathrm{m}$ (DS7) to $104~\mathrm{m}$ (DS6) an d $173~\mathrm{m}$ (DS4). Starting with DS1–DS3, the depocenter was situate d at the western basin margin and dominated by southward botto m water inflow from the northeast Kardiva Channel and inflow fro m the newly opened northwest Kardiva Channel. DS4–DS7 mark th e gradual eastward shift of the depocenters. The uppermost sequences (DS8–DS9) exhibit a more uniform thickness throughou t the Inner Sea of the Maldives.  

# Site U1468  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1468 is located in the Kardiva Channel in the Inner Sea a t $4^{\circ}55.9823^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $073^{\circ}4.2834^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ . This site is the easternmost site of th e northern transect, $4.8~\mathrm{km}$ east of Site U1466 (Figure F5). At Sit e U1468, seismic profiles indicate a succession with the Oligocene/Miocene boundary at 710.5 ms TWT followed by the basinal to lower slope deposits of the lower–middle Miocene Kardiva carbonate platform. The base of the overlying drift succession (reflection DS1) is a gently basinward-dipping horizon. The drift itself i s 431 ms TWT thick, which equals $433\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . The modern currentswept seafloor is at $521.45~\mathrm{m}$ water depth.  

Site U1468, together with Site U1466, is a key site (1) to constrain the timing of the platform to drift turnover, (2) to date th e sequence boundaries of the Kardiva platform, and (3) to reconstruc t the platform evolution from the Oligocene/Miocene boundary onward. With regard to the drift sequences, the position of Site U146 8 was chosen because it bears an extended thickness of the DS1 succession and a greater thickness of DS2 compared to the successio n at Site U1466. Additionally, it allows us to study the proximal to distal depositional trend in the drift package. Because the sequences o f the mid-Miocene drift succession are likely to be determined b y fluctuations of the bottom-current regime (Lüdmann et al., 2013), dating such variations and understanding the drift facies will help t o address the paleoceanographic objective of the expedition to lin k the changes of the Maldives current regime to global Neogen e ocean circulation. The succession recovered at Site U1468 also provides the opportunity to retrieve a complete record of $\delta^{13}{\cal C}$ variations in periplatform carbonates through the lower and middl e Miocene for establishing the carbon isotopic record needed to calibrate this hemipelagic record against the pelagic record.  

# Principal results  

Two holes were drilled at Site U1468. Hole U1468A cored 873. 7 m of carbonates (with $53\%$ recovery) using a combination of the adcanced piston corer (APC), half-length APC (HLAPC), and extended core barrel (XCB) coring systems. Hole U1468B was drille d as a dedicated logging hole with the rotary core barrel (RCB) syste m to 874.7 mbsf. Sediments from a variety of depositional setting s

were recovered at Site U1468. The top formed a drift package tha t comprises lithostratigraphic Units I–IV, and the Miocene dista l slope and the basinal deposits of the Kardiva platform form lithostratigraphic Unit V (Figure F2). A restricted basin environment defines lithostratigraphic Unit VI. Lithostratigraphic Units VII an d VIII are shallow-water deposits.  

Unit I (0–45.7 mbsf) is dominated by light gray and pale yello w to white unlithified to partially lithified packstone to grainstone. Deposits are rich in planktonic foraminifers and contain abundan t benthic foraminifers, ostracods, pteropod fragments, Halimeda fragments, mollusk fragments, echinoid fragments and spines, otoliths, fish remains, and very rare bryozoans. Foraminifers and bioclasts are well preserved with aggregate grains, organic matter, an d yellow- to brown-stained lithoclasts. The fine fraction contains aragonite needles $(<\!5\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ , calcite crystals $(5{-}10~\upmu\mathrm{m})$ , and calcareou s nannofossils (coccoliths). Variations in grain size and texture, i n particular the gradual change from packstone to grainstone layers, are interpreted to be the result of changing current strength.  

Unit II (45.7–192.4 mbsf) mainly consists of unlithified to partially lithified rudstone to wackestone with abundant to frequen t

large benthic foraminifers (Figure F23). The matrix throughout th e entire unit contains abundant calcite crystals and very rare dolomit e rhombs and calcareous nannofossils. Rudstone layers containin g rip-up clasts, other small lithoclasts, echinoid spines and fragments, and other large bioclasts often form the base of graded beds tha t have a slight erosional base and fine upward to a fine-grained grainstone (Figure F24).  

Unit III (192.4–296.4 mbsf) is a light brownish gray to light gra y wackestone succession with intercalations of packstone. This unit i s characterized by the reappearance of planktonic foraminifers an d the disappearance of large benthic foraminifers. Intraclasts ar e common, indicating early marine cementation and reworking. Mos t bioclasts are heavily overgrown with dogtooth calcite crystals. Th e matrix contains abundant calcite crystals, whereas sponge spicule s are minimally present within the fine matrix. Calcareous nannofossils are extremely rare to absent.  

Unit IV (296.4–427.7 mbsf) consists of lithified packstone t o wackestone. Components in this unit include bioclastic fragments, as well as planktonic and benthic foraminifers that are severel y overgrown by calcite cements. The degree of bioturbation in thi s

unit  allows  the  identification  of  several  ichnotaxa,  includin g Thalassinoides, Palaeophycus, Planolites, and Chondrites. Occasionally, some burrows are silicified.  

Massive wackestone makes up Unit V (427.7–728.6 mbsf) . Throughout the unit are alternations of light and dark intervals; th e darker color is linked to a higher abundance of organic material. The main components in this unit are planktonic foraminifers, wit h benthic foraminifers, mollusk fragments, and bioclast fragments. The components found have calcite cement overgrowth. The wellpreserved ichnotaxa identified within this unit include Thalassinoides, Teichichnus, Asterosoma, Phycosiphon, Zoophycos, Palaeophycus, Planolites, and Chondrites.  

Unit VI (728.6–815.9 mbsf) is a wackestone to packstone succession that consists of light gray chalk with intercalations of dar k gray to black layers with abundant organic matter (Figure F25) . Planktonic foraminifers are abundant, and the rock matrix consist s of calcareous nannofossils. Unit VII is layered wackestone wit h floatstone intercalations containing large benthic foraminifers Amphistegina, Lepidocyclina, Cycloclypeus, and Miogypsina.  

Unit VIII forms the lowest part of the cored succession at Sit e U1468. It is densely cemented limestone that contains abundan t shallow-water biota such small and large benthic foraminifers, Halimeda plates, bivalve fragments, and bryozoan and coral fragments.  

Biostratigraphic analysis of the microflora and microfauna allowed us to divide the succession into four intervals. Interval  A reaches to ${\sim}45$ mbsf and ranges in age from the late Pliocene t o Quaternary. The lower part of the Pliocene is missing. Interval B extends from about 45 to 429 mbsf. It comprises middle to late Miocene calcareous microfossils, which are generally sparse and poorl y preserved throughout the succession. One sample at 40.59 mbs f contains a few late Miocene to Pliocene–Pleistocene specimens o f planktonic foraminifers mixed with abundant abraded and recrystallized large foraminifers. The base of biostratigraphic interval  B corresponds to the base of the drift sequence as determined by seismic stratigraphy and lithostratigraphy. Interval C encompasses th e middle Miocene to upper Oligocene between 447.3 and 827.4 mbs f with abundant and moderately to well-preserved calcareous nannoplankton. The lowest interval D contains mainly large benthic foraminifers derived from the forereef environment.

Geochemical  analyses  revealed  minimal  changes  in  th e $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{\;\;2-}/\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ ratio and alkalinity of the interstitial fluids in the uppermost $200\;\mathrm{m}$ . Below $200\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , a net decrease in the concentration o f $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ is caused by bacterial sulfate reduction. The aragonite concentration in the sediments remains between $20\%$ and $40\%$ throughout the uppermost $50~\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , reflecting variations in input rather tha n diagenetic change to LMC. The sudden loss in aragonite below ${\sim}50$ mbsf suggests a period of exposure to fluids that caused partial dolomitization. Neomorphism of the sediments to LMC and som e limited amount of dolomitization is indicated by the rapid increas e in the $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}/\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ratio of the pore water below $200\ \mathrm{mbsf}.$ Althoug h dolomite formation is supported by the decline in the $\mathrm{Mg/Ca}$ rati o of the pore fluid, the present dolomite formation indicated by por e water data is not responsible for the up to $25\%$ dolomite found i n the sediments. This indicates that dolomite must have forme d during earlier time periods in a different fluid regime than observe d at the present. The large increase in $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ in Unit III causes the por e fluids to attain saturation with respect to $\mathrm{SrSO_{4}}$ and precipitation o f celestine, detected by XRD.  

The influence of noncarbonate components on pore wate r chemistry can be seen between 450 and $500~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , where the carbonate content of the sediments decreases to $\mathord{\sim}80\%$ . Here, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ in th e pore waters increases slightly. Increased Fe in the sediments and th e marked increase in the $\mathrm{Mn}/\mathrm{Ca}$ ratio below this depth clearly indicate the significance of this transition, which is reflected in a significant reduction in the rate of sedimentation as indicated b y biostratigraphic data.  

Paleomagnetic analyses show contamination of the core sediment with highly magnetic material. This is unambiguously show n by the typical pattern of NRM intensity that decreases from the upper to lower part of each core by 3 or 4 orders of magnitude. AP C and HLAPC cores drilled in the upper part of Hole U1468A see m more affected by this problem compared to XCB cores drilled in th e deepest part of the same hole. The distribution of inclinations, despite the large scatter, has a single mode at $0^{\circ}$ , suggesting that Sit e U1468 crossed the Equator during the early Miocene.  

The strata at this site can be divided into five physical propertie s units. NGR has the most variability and basically defines the physical properties units, but other properties also contribute. For example, in physical properties Unit 1 $(0{-}50\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ ), bulk density is lo w and porosity is high. At 50 mbsf, they shift abruptly to higher (density) and lower (porosity) values, and subsequently they only show  a slight increase and decrease, respectively, to the bottom of the hole. Porosity remains very high even to great burial depths, with ove r $50\%$ porosity at 800 mbsf. Likewise, velocity only displays a sligh t overall increase in physical properties Units 2–5 to about $2400\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , but high values of up to ${\sim}4000~\mathrm{m/s}$ are measured in the more lithified beds. A velocity inversion occurs in physical properties Unit  4 produced by the chalk interval of lithostratigraphic Unit VII. Colo r reflectance quantifies the observed cyclic dark–light alternations i n the rock but also captures the overall darker tones of lithostratigraphic Units II and IV.  

A dedicated logging hole was drilled at Site U1468 to ensure  a complete set of downhole measurements. During the first loggin g run with the triple combo tool string, however, wireline tension increased at $485\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ and caliper measurements indicated a narrow borehole less than 7 inches in diameter. These collapsing hol e conditions persisted to $280\,\textrm{m}$ WSF, above which the logging ru n could be completed. No additional logging tool strings were run. I n the narrow interval of the collapsing hole, data quality was reduce d but the lower and upper portion yielded good data. Based on th e electrical resistivity and gamma ray logs, four logging units wer e identified. Logging Unit 1 extends from the base of the drill pipe t o $201\textrm{m}$ wireline log matched depth below seafloor (WMSF) and i s characterized by low gamma ray and resistivity values, both wit h low to moderate amplitude variability except for two peaks aroun d 190 and $200\ \mathrm{m}$ WSF. Logging Unit 1 correlates mostly with lithostratigraphic Unit II, which in the logged interval displays an overall coarsening-upward trend and textures from mudstone to packston e at the base and grainstone to rudstone at the top. In logging Unit  2 ( $201{-}490\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{WSF})$ ), the character of the resistivity changes with alternations of lower and higher resistivity over intervals of meters t o tens of meters. The gamma ray log is nearly flat, except at the bas e of the unit between 450 and $490\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ . This logging unit corresponds to lithostratigraphic Units III and IV and part of V. Units II I and IV correspond to the drift sediments of DS1 (Figure F26) , which is composed of wackestone with some packstone interval s (Unit III) and lithified packstone (Unit IV). Intervals of highe r

gamma ray and corresponding resistivity variations at the base o f logging Unit 2, from 450 to $490\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF, capture alternations of submeter to multiple meter scale light and dark intervals deposited a t the distal bottomsets of the prograding Kardiva platform that ar e characterized by the alternations of darker and lighter packstones t o wackestones. The resistivity log reflects this rather uniform lithology with low variability values that slightly increase with depth. The gamma ray log displays more variability from low to moderat e amplitude and also increases with depth. These variations in th e gamma ray signature are mostly the result of uranium variation s that are likely related to changes in the organic material that varie s from the dark (high) to light (low) intervals. In logging Unit 4 (720– $835\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF), the resistivity amplitude changes from low to moderate. Likewise, the gamma ray log exhibits the greatest variabilit y compared to the other units. Lithologically, Unit 4 coincides with  a thick upper Oligocene–lower Miocene package of chalky sedimen t with intercalations of dark organic-rich layers. These dark layers ar e taken as indicators of higher productivity and lower oxygenatio n during times of deposition.  

Although no sonic log or VSP could be run at Site U1468, tw o high-impedance events identified by distinct lithology changes i n the core helped us build a robust velocity model for the time-dept h conversion of the seismic horizons. The first impedance event i s generated by the top of the densely cemented shallow-water limestone of the Oligocene carbonate platform at 854.7 mbsf ( $1398~\mathrm{ms}$ TWT) and the overlying wackestone–floatstone; the second is  a densely cemented grainstone interval with a top surface at 540 mbs f (1198 ms TWT). These two surfaces are used as “check shots” fo r refining the velocity model.  

The penetrated seismic section at Site U1468 displays four mai n seismic facies (Figure F27). At the bottom are near-horizontal seismic reflections with a distinct high-amplitude reflection that corresponds to the top of the Oligocene shallow-water carbonat e platform, which produces the O/M reflection. The $\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{M}$ reflectio n was defined by Belopolsky and Droxler (2004a) as the Oligocene/Miocene boundary, but shipboard biostratigraphic analysis o f the calcareous nannoplankton and planktonic foraminifers indicates that the Oligocene/Miocene boundary is located further upsection between 769.74 and 779.36 mbsf (i.e., between the $\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{M}$ horizon and PS1). This interval is composed of a nannofossil chal k package with intercalations of organic-rich layers. Above this chal k package, near-horizontal, low-amplitude reflections occur that ar e the distal bottomsets of Kardiva platform sequences PS1–PS1 1 (427.7–724.56 mbsf). These reflections are composed of bioturbated planktonic foraminiferal wackestone to packstone with meter-thick alternations of darker and lighter layers. Sections o f alternating amplitude intensities are likely caused by pulses of sediment deposition, intermittent slow sedimentation, and associate d diagenesis (Anselmetti et al., 2000; Malone et al., 2001). The age o f these prograding sequences ranges from middle Burdigalian t o Langhian or approximately from 21 to $12.7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

Wavy high-amplitude reflections document the onset of current-dominated sedimentation in the first drift sequences at 43 4 mbsf. DS1 displays a large mounded geometry with high-amplitud e parallel reflections that conjugate basinward. The lower part of DS 1 consists of lithified bioclastic packstones to wackestones. DS2 consists of high-amplitude, slightly inclined seismic reflections and i s composed of a series of unlithified to partially lithified coarseningupward packages of large benthic foraminiferal grainstone to rudstone. At the top of DS2, the reflections become nearly horizontal, marking the apex of the drift mound that continues into the base o f DS9. At Site U1468, the sequence boundaries of DS3–DS9 merg e into two horizontal reflections separated only by approximately 2 0 m. DS9 and DS10, the uppermost drift sequences, show undulatin g high-amplitude reflections and a facies of mud-poor bioclasti c packstones and grainstones, similar to modern seafloor sediments.

# Site U1469  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1469 (proposed Site MAL-8A) lies $2.87\ \mathrm{km}$ $\mathrm{(1.57\nmi)}$ south-southwest of Site U1465, which is the westernmost site of th e northern transect in the western part of the Kardiva Channel (Figure F5). It is located at $4^{\circ}54.41^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $73^{\circ}0.48^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ , at a water depth of 42 7 m. The Kardiva Channel formed as a result of the demise of large r carbonate banks during the Miocene (Purdy and Bertram, 1993; Aubert and Droxler, 1996; Belopolsky and Droxler, 2004a, 2004b; Betzler et al., 2009). The northern transect, including Site U1469, i s in the approximately $12\;\mathrm{km}$ wide northwestern branch of the Kardiva Channel between the Goidhoo and Maalhosmadulu atolls. A t present, this passage accommodates seasonally reversing and monsoonal-driven water throughflow. Currents affect the water colum n down to the sediment surface and trigger erosion at the seafloor an d migration of large-scale carbonate sand and mud waves. This depositional regime has persisted since the Miocene, and the hypothesi s to test is that the onset of current and partial drowning of the carbonate banks were intimately linked (Betzler et al., 2009; Eberli e t al., 2010). Seismic stratigraphy and facies indicate that the onset o f this current was a rapid process and that the intensity of the currents varied through time (Lüdmann et al., 2013).  

Site U1469 was selected to document and reconstruct the carbonate bank depositional system of the drowned Miocene bank an d to link the seismic sequences to facies. The target depth was 70 0 mbsf, which is the base of PS7, the first sequence after the Kardiv a platform went from mostly aggrading growth to progradation.  

The specific objectives of Site U1469 were (1) to provide a detailed  reconstruction  of  the  predrowning,  drowning,  an d postdrowning evolution of the carbonate bank by linking the seismic stratigraphic record to the sedimentary record; (2) to constrai n the timing of this evolution, thus allowing age assignments of unconformities, sedimentary interruptions, sedimentary turnovers, and onset of drift deposition; and (3) to reconstruct and date ban k to drift turnover.  

# Principal results  

The sedimentary succession at Site U1469 was expected to b e comparable to that at Site U1465, with a package of loose drift carbonate sands overlying the limestones of the drowned platform. Th e site was cored with the RCB system because only faulty sleeves fo r XCB coring were available at the time of drilling. As a result, recovery was very low.  

Three lithostratigraphic units are defined at Site U1469 (Figur e F3). Unit I $(0{-}93.0~\mathrm{mbsf})$ represents the youngest hemipelagic deposits, which consist of partly lithified to lithified, gray-brown t o pale yellow, coarse-grained, very well sorted grainstone to packstone. Bioclasts are typical open marine pelagic fauna and mino r proportions of skeletal benthic fauna that may have originated clos e to the active atolls and transported by the currents to the Kardiv a Channel.  

Unit II (93.0–141.7 mbsf) contains coarse-grained grainstone t o rudstone with increased amounts of benthic foraminifers and admixtures of corals, bivalves, Halimeda, and echinoderm spines. Th e coarser grain size and the microfaunal assemblage indicate a shallower and higher energy current-dominated environment compared to Unit I. These deposits cover the top of a drowne d carbonate platform that makes up Unit III (141.7–153.4 mbsf). Th e lithologies of Unit III consist of dolomitized coral-rich floatston e with massive and branching coral fragments, rhodoliths, gastropods, and other encrusting organisms interpreted as a shallow-marine reef to forereef setting (Figure F28).

Because of poor recovery, no continuous record of core catcher s could be obtained. As a result, the biostratigraphic age model fo r this site is limited, but both the planktonic foraminifers and the calcareous nannofossils indicate a Quaternary to early Pliocene age fo r sediments above the drowned platform. Planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy identified two Pleistocene biohorizons, the LOs of Globigerinoides fistulosus $\left\langle1.88\,\mathrm{\sf~Ma}\right\rangle$ and Globorotalia limbata (2.3 9 Ma), which were found at 44.57 and $63.96~\mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , respectively. Th e Pliocene LOs of Dentoglobigerina altispira (3.47 Ma) and Globorotalia margaritae were found at 63.96 and 73.7 mbsf, respectively. The occurrence of nannofossils is sparse and poorly preserved. Thus, no assemblages are unambiguously datable. However, th e presence of small Gephyrocapsa specimens in the upper part of th e sequence (25–93 mbsf) indicates that these samples are Quaternar y to middle Pliocene in age (Zones NN21 to NN14). Similarly, th e consistent presence of Sphenolithus specimens in the lower part o f the site (73.6–122.1 mbsf) suggests that this part of the sequence i s middle Pliocene or older (Zone NN15 or older), although they coul d be reworked. No Miocene marker species were seen. The drowne d platform does not contain any age-diagnostic benthic foraminifers, but seismic stratigraphic evidence places a middle Miocene age a t the drowning surface.  

Seven sediment samples above the platform yielded carbonat e contents between 94.95 and $97.95~\mathrm{wt\%}$ , and their total organic carbon is between 0.04 and $0.15~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . The mineralogy of the sedimen t consists of aragonite, HMC, LMC, and dolomite. HMC is presen t only to 25 mbsf and reaches a maximum of $8.9\%$ . Aragonite occur s at concentrations between $10.7\%$ and $49.0\%$ from the surface to 73. 6 mbsf. Below this depth, most of the aragonite and all of the HM C neomorphosed to LMC. Dolomite is present with a low abundanc e of $<\!3.3\%$ above 93 mbsf. Below 93 mbsf, dolomite increases to concentrations between $4.4\%$ and $30.9\%$ and the concentration of aragonite decreases. The platform carbonates at 153.22 mbsf ar e completely dolomitized.  

One paleomagnetic reversal is recognized at 153.8 mbsf and i s normal below. In addition, a possible short reversal occurs at 153. 9 mbsf.

Physical properties fall into two groups that correspond to th e Pliocene–Pleistocene drift sediments (physical properties Unit 1 ) and the carbonate platform succession (physical properties Unit 2). The slightly lithified grainstone to rudstone facies of the drift sediment displays low NGR that increases downhole. As in the drift sediments of the other sites, bulk density is low $(1.5{-}2.0\;\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , porosity is very high, ranging from $42\%$ to $52\%$ , and $P.$ -wave velocit y reaches $2562\;\mathrm{m/s}$ . The dramatic facies change to platform carbonates at 141.7 mbsf is reflected in the physical properties. The dolomitized limestone has high NGR values. Bulk density averages 2. 5 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , whereas grain density is $2.84\:\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , confirming the complet e dolomitization of this interval. Porosity is between $15.4\%$ and $22.8\%$ . Despite relatively high porosity, velocities are over $5000~\mathrm{m/s}$ . Thi s can be explained by the dominance of the moldic pore types tha t produce a rock with a stiff framework.  

The time-depth conversion for correlating the seismic data t o the lithology relied on the velocity model from Site U1465, whic h has a similar lithology. Similar to Site U1465, Site U1469 is at th e margin of the drowned Kardiva platform and overlain by drift deposits (Figure F29). At this location, however, the sequence stratigraphic interpretation indicates a younger age for the top of th e Kardiva platform. Additionally, the drift sequences overlying DS 4 are more complete. The seismic facies of the drowned Kardiva platform displays a series of prograding clinoforms with slightly basinward inclined topsets and steep foresets that flatten out basinward. The overlying drift deposits are horizontal, semicontinuous, medium-amplitude reflections of DS4–DS10 and are interpreted to b e late Miocene to recent in age. However, no age-diagnostic fossil s were found in the portion directly overlying the drowned platform. The drowned platform top is part of PS11, which was interpreted t o be middle Miocene in age. Shore-based radiometric dating will b e needed to assess the exact age.  

# Site U1470  

# Background and objectives  

The western Kardiva Channel that connects the open India n Ocean with the Inner Sea of the Maldives is divided into norther n and southern branches by the Goidhoo atoll. The second transect o f sites drilled during Expedition 359 is located in this souther n branch of the Kardiva Channel. Site U1470 is the westernmost sit e of this southern transect (Figure F5) and has a geographical position of $4^{\circ}45.9823^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $72^{\circ}59.0267^{\prime}\mathrm{E},$ and a water depth of $399.7\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

The site was positioned where seismic data indicated that a carbonate platform existed during the early stages of drift deposition. This seismic relationship implied that at this location the platfor m drowning is younger than in the northern Kardiva Channel. Th e main goal at Site U1470 was therefore to recover the drift to platform succession, which contains a platform that drowned at a late r stage than the platforms in the northern transect. The specific objectives were (1) to provide a detailed reconstruction of th e predrowning, drowning, and postdrowning evolution of the carbonate bank by linking the seismic stratigraphic record to the sedimentary record; (2) to constrain the timing of this platfor m drowning and the burial by drift sediments; and (3) to reconstruc t

# Principal results  

Site U1470 penetrated $147.9\;\mathrm{m}$ of carbonate sand and $186.2\,\mathrm{m}$ o f limestone from the underlying carbonate platform (Figure F3). Th e uppermost $59.1\;\mathrm{m}$ (lithostratigraphic Unit I) of the sheeted drift deposits was unlithified coarse-grained grainstone to packstone wit h abundant planktonic foraminifers but also benthic foraminifers, ostracods, pteropods, echinoderm spines, bryozoan fragments, an d bivalves, as well as yellow-red–stained lithic grains and red alga e fragments. In lithostratigraphic Unit II (59.1–147.8 mbsf), th e grainstones become more lithified and the composition changes t o a diverse assemblage of bioclasts.  

Three lithostratigraphic units were identified in the platfor m succession. Unit III (147.9–188.4 mbsf) comprises coral-rich floatstone to boundstone, documenting a shallow-water reefal environment at the top of the drowned platform. Unit IV (198–207.7 mbsf ) is bioclast-rich grainstone to rudstone that, with its composition o f large benthic foraminifers, red algae, green algae (Halimeda), an d coral fragments, resembles a reef-apron facies. Unit V (207.7– $334.11~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) is a reef facies with interbedded grayish brown coralrich boundstone and red algae floatstone. Coral fragments includ e massive, platy, and branching forms. Rhodoliths are present in different sizes up to $4\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ long with branching irregular shapes.  

Micropaleontological analysis (Figure F30) of core samples fro m the drift package above the platform carbonates allowed us to defin e a sequence of biostratigraphic events and a well-constrained ag e model for the upper part of the sedimentary succession that span s

Concentrations of major anions and cations display near constant and close to seawater values, although changes in carbonate mineralogy occur in the sam e interval. This pattern was observed at several other sites during Expeditio n 359 and might be the result of massive advection that dilutes the signatur e of diagenesis in the pore water of highly porous drift sediment.  

![](images/c67f6e84d76a8146ec46f92ac29367a66bce4908ecedd0b536e8c5e247d960cd.jpg)  
from the Quaternary to the lower Pliocene. As at other sites, however, throughout this interval the planktonic foraminifers consistently indicate older ages and lower sedimentation rates than th e calcareous nannofossils. For the lower part of the cored interval, lower Pliocene and possibly uppermost Miocene, only a singl e planktonic foraminiferal event was identified. This suggests that th e sedimentation rate remained constant throughout the Pliocene a t ${\sim}2.2\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ and that the base of the drift sequence overlying th e drowned platform top is older than $5.92\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

The concentrations of major anions and cations determine d from IW chemistry display near constant and close to seawater values through the uppermost $150\;\mathrm{m}$ of the unlithified drift sediments. This lack of gradient and thus indication of diagenetic alteration i s in contrast to the changes in carbonate mineralogy across the sam e interval that document the disappearance of HMC and formation o f small amounts of dolomite (Figure F31). This pattern was observe d at several other sites during Expedition 359 and might be the resul t of massive advection that dilutes the signature of diagenesis in th e pore water of highly porous drift sediment. The drowned platfor m cored at Site U1470 is mostly limestone with only a short interval with $20\%$ dolomite and preserved aragonite between 200 and 25 0 mbsf. In the platform strata recovered at Sites U1469 and U1465, the drowned platform is considerably more dolomitized.  

The paleomagnetic analysis was severely hampered by a persistent contamination that typically affected the first two sections o f each core (this problem was already observed at the other sites) an d a novel artifact that mostly affected measurements below 60 mbsf i n Hole U1470A. Starting from Core 359-U1470A-8H, the measure d paleomagnetic directions of the “uncontaminated” portion of eac h core show a constant direction toward east with a subhorizontal inclination $(\sim\!090/00)$ independent of the actual core orientation. Given all the uncertainties associated with these measurements, w e did not attempt to interpret these results as a record of geomagneti c polarity changes.  

The sedimentary succession from Site U1470 is divided int o three physical properties units based on the changes observed i n NGR, $P$ -wave velocity, bulk density, and porosity measurements. Physical properties Units 1 and 2 $(0{-}148\,\mathrm{\mbsf})$ comprise uppe r Miocene to recent drift sediments. The entire package has very hig h porosity, although in Unit 1 porosity decreases from $80\%$ to $60\%$ with a more gradual decrease ranging from $60\%$ to $40\%$ in physica l properties Unit 2. Sonic velocity is low (average $=1725\;\mathrm{m/s}$ ) and increases slightly to the bottom of Unit 2. NGR fluctuates with hig h frequency throughout these two units but has a low at the uni t boundary. Physical properties Unit 3 (148–334.1 mbsf) consists o f samples from the carbonate platform succession with high velocit y and density values and a concomitant decrease in porosity. Velocit y varies widely from 2000 to $5000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ .

Seismically, the drift sequences overlying the drowned platfor m are mostly subparallel, semicontinuous reflections, mainly of medium amplitude. DS10 and DS9 correspond to drift deposits of unlithified planktonic foraminifer–rich grainstone. This package i s followed by the partly lithified bioclastic grain- to packstone o f lithostratigraphic Unit II, which comprises DS3–DS8. The bounding unconformity of DS3 corresponds to the top of the shallow-water platform limestone (lithostratigraphic Unit III). The top of th e coral-rich boundstone and floatstone in lithostratigraphic Unit V i s the reflector for DS1 (Figure F32). This platform package thins ou t and DS3 and DS2 almost merge $400\;\mathrm{m}$ to the west. DS1 and DS2 a t this locality therefore bear a platform succession that postdates th e drowning event recognized at Sites U1465 and U1469. The DS 2 bank is characterized by an elevated top and shows basinward-dipping reflections in its eastern part. To the west, these reflection s abut the basal sequence boundary of DS3, which can be explaine d by two processes. This stratal pattern could show a late-stag e predrowning reef package, or it might reflect erosion of the reef-related strata.  

# Site U1471  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1471 is the eastern end of the southern transect a t $4^{\circ}45.9828^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $073^{\circ}08.1146^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ , in a water depth of $419.3~\mathrm{m}$ in the Inner Sea (Figure F5). The site is positioned on the distal portion o f the prograding drift where it thins and is overlain by the sheete d drift deposits. The target depth is in the distal bottomsets of the se a level–controlled platform sequences underneath the drift, estimated to be at about 950 mbsf (Figure F8). At this location, all sequence boundaries are conformable; therefore, cores from this sit e were expected to provide a continuous and expanded record of current evolution from the middle Miocene throughout the Pleistocene.  

The specific objectives for Site U1471 were (1) to constrain th e age of onset of current-dominated sedimentation; (2) to analyze th e cyclostratigraphy of drift deposits, therefore providing reconstructions of changes in the current regime and monsoon cyclicity; an d (3) to constrain the timing of sequence boundaries within the drif t and the youngest platform sequence.  

# Principal results  

An $889\;\mathrm{m}$ thick succession of drift deposits above $110.9\;\mathrm{m}$ thic k distal platform bottomsets was retrieved at Site U1471. Seven lithostratigraphic units are distinguished in the drift deposits that reflec t the degree of current-controlled winnowing and diagenetic overprint (Figure F3). Unit VIII comprises the periplatform deposits i n the distal bottomsets. Units I–III (0–180.1 mbsf) consist of planktonic foraminifer–rich packstone to wackestone that is heavily bioturbated, often producing a mottled appearance. All three unit s contain  benthic  foraminifers,  echinoderm  spines,  pteropods, sponge spicules, calcareous nannofossils, and mollusk fragments i n addition to abundant planktonic foraminifers. The degree of lithification was used to distinguish unlithified Unit I from partly lithifie d Unit II, and the predominance of the wackestone texture was take n as the criteria to separate Unit III. All three units contain alternations of intervals with darker and lighter colors. These alternation s range from ${\sim}1$ to $10\;\mathrm{m},$ and the darker portion of the alternation i s generally much thinner $\left.\sim\!20\%\right.$ of the total). The dark intervals comprise higher amounts of organic material and tunicates but fewe r benthic foraminifers compared to the lighter intervals.  

Units IV (180.1–254.6 mbsf) and $\mathrm{V}$ (254.6–588.2 mbsf) hav e similar textures and consist predominantly of planktonic foraminifer–rich packstone. These units differ in the amount of lithificatio n rather than composition, with alternating lithified and unlithifie d layers in Unit IV. Unit V contains densely cemented layers and layers with moldic porosity. Unit IV has some wackestone intercalations that are generally less lithified than the packstone. In bot h units, overgrowth of bioclasts was prevalent. Several intervals i n Unit V exhibit visible porosity, including intraparticle, moldic, an d vuggy porosity. At times, celestine is present, forming large crystal s spanning adjacent pores (Figure F33).  

Unit VI was defined by the occurrence of alternations of ver y fine to medium-grained dark brownish packstone and dark brownish gray to light gray wackestone/packstone. In addition to planktonic foraminifers, sponge spicules, radiolarians, and calcareou s nannofossils were identified, as well as rare dolomite crystals. Packstone intervals are thinner than those comprising wackestone an d are less bioturbated than wackestone intervals; individual burrow s are discernable, and lamination-like structures are present. Th e burrows are in some cases completely flattened, and some of th e discontinuous lamination-like structures may be highly compacte d burrows, possibly with organic matter. Planolites, Chondrites, Palaeophycus, Phycosiphon, Thalassinoides, Teichichnus, and Zoophycos  ichnofossils  were  identified,  in  that  order  of  abundance.

Fractures in incompletely cemented beds occur as both open an d cemented fractures.  

Unit VII contains thin, loosely cemented grainstone layers i n background sediment of fine-grained foraminifer-rich packstone. The light brownish gray to light gray coarse-grained bioclastic-ric h grainstone is between 2 and $78~\mathrm{cm}$ thick (average $=14.0~\mathrm{{cm}_{.}^{~}}$ ). Th e layers often (but not always) have sharp lower boundaries and  a more gradational top. Grain size does not vary much within th e grainstone layers. These layers were interpreted as reflecting highenergy current events within the first drift sequence.  

In the distal bottomsets of the prograding clinoforms of Uni t VIII, the facies changes considerably from very fine to fine-grained, white to light gray, foraminifer-rich packstone to wackestone an d from very fine grained and finer dark gray wackestone to mudstone. Calcareous nannofossils are abundant in both end-members; planktonic foraminifers are abundant in the lighter packstone to wackestone and rare in the dark wackestone to mudstone. Benthi c foraminifers and glauconite are present only in the lighter packstone to wackestone. In the lighter intervals, bioturbation is com

Biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental analyses in Hole s U1471A, U1471C, and U1471E provide a robust age model at Sit e U1471. Pleistocene and late Pliocene sediments extend from th e seafloor to $\mathord{\sim}150$ mbsf and are defined by a succession of well-constrained events and reasonably good agreement of the data. The implied sedimentation rate is $4.0\,\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ . However, there is a consisten t offset between the ages inferred from calcareous nannofossil event s and those from planktonic foraminifers, with the planktonic foraminifers suggesting ages about 0.5 My older than the calcareou s nannofossils. This pattern was also seen in this interval at Site s U1465–U1467, so possibly the age calibrations of these events ma y need revision, at least for this area.  

Figure F35. Relative concentrations of aragonite, HMC, LMC, dolomite, an d quartz measured using XRD, Site U1471.  

In the underlying bottomsets, preservation of planktonic foraminifers is generally moderate to very poor. Benthic foraminifer s are moderately preserved throughout this interval, with preservation decreasing downhole. Nannofossil preservation is poor t o moderate throughout most of the core. In the lower part of Hol e U1471E (Cores 37R–44R), nannofossils are generally more abundant and better preserved. The planktonic foraminiferal and nannofossil events recognized in this lower Pliocene to mid-Miocen e section reasonably agree with each other. They provide an inferre d sedimentation rate of $8.0\;\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ .  

The concentrations of major anions and cations in IW of the upper 40 mbsf exhibit negligible changes. Below this interval, pore water profiles of many elements start to vary, indicating numerou s diagenetic processes occurring in the sediment column. The inflection points of these profiles, however, do not coincide with boundaries between lithostratigraphic units.  

![](images/9bd2fa6c5a4463ae19fba0a1c7121392709dbada718949a0a1c54ccd459b5f28.jpg)  

A decrease of sulfate coincided well with an increase in alkalinity, indicating that bacterial sulfate reduction is occurring in th e sediment column. However, a greater increase in alkalinity was expected from the ${\sim}4~\mathrm{mM}$ decrease in sulfate than was observed; th e difference is explained by the authigenic precipitation of calcite. The decrease in ${\mathrm{Mg}}^{2+}$ and concurrent increase in $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ reflects dolomitization by replacement of calcium carbonate. However, only  a minor amount of dolomite was found at this site, with the dolomit e peak at 105.55 mbsf occurring close to the maximum decrease i n $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ concentrations. A rapid increase in the $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}/\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ratios of th e pore water occurs below 40 mbsf, documenting the neomorphis m of aragonite sediments to LMC, which is also evident in the change s in carbonate mineralogy based on the XRD data (Figure F35). Th e large increase in $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ caused the pore fluids to attain saturation wit h respect to celestine $\mathrm{(SrSO_{4})}$ ). The presence of celestine and high sedimentary $\mathrm{Sr}/\mathrm{Ca}$ ratios extends to approximately 700 mbsf. Change s in the Mn content of the pore waters and sediments were related t o the redox state. The higher Pliocene–Pleistocene $\mathrm{Mn}/\mathrm{Ca}$ and $\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{Ca}$ ratios may reflect a more reducing environment during this time interval relative to the late Miocene. The small increase in $\mathrm{Mn}/\mathrm{Ca}$ an d $\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{Ca}$ in the middle Miocene may be coincident with the development of the Oxygen Minimum Zone as proposed by Dickens an d Owen (1994).  

A cyclic pattern in carbonate content is visible when the data ar e smoothed with a five-point moving average, with alternations of ${\sim}5$ $\mathrm{wt\%}$ between higher and lower values. The upper 300 mbsf has  a period of ${\sim}40\;\mathrm{m}$ with seven or eight maxima within this depth interval. Where recovery was poor, from 300 to 400 mbsf, the smoothin g was not effective, but cycles with an amplitude of ${\sim}5\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ carbonat e were again apparent between 400 and $1000\;\mathrm{mbsf}.$ . The apparent cycles in carbonate content may be related to changes in climate o r currents, which influenced sediment supply and probably carbonat e dissolution at Site U1471.  

For establishing a magnetostratigraphy at Site U1471, the coreorienting device was used in the upper 19 cores drilled in Hol e U1471C and in Cores 359-U1471D-6H and 7H. The magnetostratigraphy is based on the interpretation of the declinations in the oriented APC cores that show relatively consistent directions withi n each core, with most of the reversals occurring within a single core. The Brunhes/Matuyama boundary was tentatively placed betwee n Cores 359-U1471C-4H and 359-U1471D-6H (36–39 mbsf) base d on the short reversal found in Core 359-U1471D-5H, which was interpreted as the Jaramillo Event. Additional reversals were identified at 79, 84, 112, 152, 169, and 172 mbsf (Cores 359-U1471C-9H, 10H, 12H, 16H, and 19H).  

Analysis of physical properties allowed us to divide the sedimentary formation into six units primarily based on porosity an d NGR  measurements and  not  necessarily following lithostratigraphic unit boundaries. In physical properties Unit 1 (0–68 mbsf), sediments have high porosity values of $60\%{-75\%}$ decreasing downhole within the unit. Porosity, however, increases again downhole i n physical properties Unit 2 $\mathrm{68{-}138~m b s f)}$ to reach $75\%$ . A simila r reversal of the porosity trend occurs in the lower part of the succession in physical properties Unit 6 (700–1003 mbsf), where porosit y values reach around $50\%$ and are on average higher than in physica l properties Unit 5 (320–700 mbsf). NGR counts reach values highe r than 80 counts/s in physical properties Unit 4 (180–320 mbsf) an d are the highest NGR values measured on Expedition 359 cores.  

Three logging runs were conducted at Site U1471, but only th e triple combo tool string reached the bottom of the hole. The VS I tool string encountered an impassable obstruction at ${\sim}615\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF, and the FMS-sonic tool string did the same at $454\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF. The triple combo tool string produced good quality data, except in thre e intervals where the borehole diameter was too large. Gamma ra y values are dominated by uranium, as at other sites. The porosity lo g confirmed the high porosities measured in the laboratory and th e unusual high porosities of the drift deposits. Resistivity and magnetic susceptibility display similar trends and increase slightl y downhole between 50 and $400\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF. They decline from there t o the bottom of the hole but have a small but abrupt drop at the bottom of the drift. In the short interval velocity was measured, it displays a gradual increase with depth to $400\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF}$ with a few highe r peaks. In the deepest $40\;\mathrm{m}$ of the log data $\langle400{-}440\mathrm{\;m\;WSF}\rangle$ ), velocity fluctuates dramatically and reaches as high as $3.5~\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ . Thes e fluctuations match the alternating lithified and unlithified lithologies observed in the cores. Four formation temperature measurements documented a low geothermal gradient of $15.3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ .  

Determining the relative positions of core gaps among the various holes at Site U1471 during coring was accomplished usin g gamma ray attenuation (GRA) density data collected at $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution on the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL). NGR wa s also used to evaluate sedimentary completeness for Holes U1471A, U1471C, and U1471D. High-resolution compositing was based o n the $2.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ interval color reflectance parameter $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ for all but one interval where $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ lacked distinct patterns. The composite depth scal e and splice at Site U1471 are constructed from 0.0 to $195.71\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-D; deeper cores from Hole U1471A are appended with a constant affine value.  

The upper $30\;\mathrm{m}$ of the $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ records from Sites U1467 and U147 1 were compared to assess Late Pleistocene sections at each site. Thi s interval was correlated to $0{-}800\ \mathrm{ka}$ at Site U1467. Based on the $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ records, the latest Pleistocene is slightly more expanded at Sit e U1467 than Site U1471 over the interval correlated to marine isotope Stages (MIS) 1–11. Below this level, the reflectivity $L^{\ast}$ highs ar e more expanded at Site U1471 than Site U1467. The change in relative thickness of the reflectivity highs between Site U1467 an d U1471 sedimentation may indicate subtle changes in the location o f current-controlled sedimentation at ${\sim}450\ \mathrm{ka}$ .  

Seismic stratigraphy and core data were correlated using thre e stations of the check shot survey with the VSI tool string in the upper part of the hole. To anchor our velocity model in the interva l below 604.6 mbsf, where hole collapse prevented further lowerin g of the tool, we used the boundary between lithostratigraphic Unit s VII and VIII (Core 359-U1471E-33R), which marks the change fro m drift to platform sequences at 898 mbsf, as a tie point. The thre e oldest drift sequences (DS1–DS3) at Site U1471 show a pronounce d clinoform prograding reflection pattern. DS5–DS10 are classified a s elongated mounded separate drifts. Site U1471 penetrated the bottomsets of the prograding drift bodies, calibrating the seismic facie s with the depositional facies. For example, high-amplitude reflections, especially in DS3, are related to strong impedance contrast s produced by the alternation of partly lithified and lithified beds. I n DS3 and DS4, small-scale wavy reflections are interpreted as cycli c steps or bottom current–related features.  

Correlation of the seismic sequences and the biostratigraphi c age model shows that DS9 encompasses the Pleistocene. The pronounced change in lithology between lithostratigraphic Units I V and V at 254.6 mbsf correlates with the base of DS4 (261.5 mbsf ) and roughly coincides with the boundary between the Pliocene an d Miocene. The bottom of the drift that is the base of DS1 at 898 mbs f lithologically expresses the last occurrence of grainstone layers a t 898 mbsf in the upper middle Miocene.  

# Site U1472  

# Background and objectives  

Site  U1472  is  in  the  middle  of  the  southern  transect  a t $4^{\circ}46.2653^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $073^{\circ}04.0111^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ , at a water depth of $379.34\mathrm{~m~}$ (Figur e F5). The site is located well within the middle part of the west t o east prograding drift fan. The target for coring at this site was th e lower sequence boundary of DS1, but it was not reached because o f time constraints at the end of the expedition. Coring penetrated t o 251.9 mbsf and recovered $233.75\;\mathrm{m}\;(93\%)$ , providing a valuable dat a set for understanding drift deposition in the Inner Sea and the contourite fan depositional system. The specific objectives at this sit e were (1) to constrain the ages of the drift depositional sequences; (2) to analyze the cyclostratigraphy of drift deposits, therefore providing reconstructions of changes in the current regime and monsoon cyclicity; and (3) to retrieve the lithology of the wavy seismi c facies to confirm their current-controlled deposition.  

# Principal results  

The succession at Site U1472 is divided into four lithostratigraphic units (Figure F3). Unit I (0–52.70 mbsf) consists of unlithified packstone and grainstone texture and mud-lean fine t o medium sand. Deposits contain abundant fairly well preserve d planktonic foraminifers, pteropods, otoliths, echinoid fragments, and shell fragments. Layers of floatstone contain large bioclast s such as pteropods and solitary corals (Figure F36). Light gray t o brownish gray sediment was interpreted to reflect the presence o f organic matter and also of iron in reduced form. This sediment provides evidence for suboxic conditions at the seafloor, as does th e NGR measured on the cores. Varying gray-brown color changes associated with a cyclic pattern of $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ color reflectance and NGR likel y indicate that these conditions fluctuated through time.  

Unit I has grainstone to packstone textures, lithostratigraphi c Unit II $\langle52.70{-}195.20\ \mathrm{mbsf}\rangle$ consists of packstone to wackeston e but has a similar composition. NGR values in Unit II are distinctl y lower than in Unit I, and the top of Unit II contains large bioclast s and shells, suggesting a phase of intensified bottom current.  

The transition from packstone to grainstone texture and th e grain size change from predominantly medium- to coarse-graine d grainstone-packstone define the top of Unit III. Unit III is characterized by the appearance of large benthic foraminiferal assemblages typical of neritic environments. Foraminiferal shells hav e extensive overgrowths, masking their original shape. The textural,

grain size, and biota assemblage changes collectively imply that thi s unit represents a shallowing-upward succession.  

Unit IV (224.22–249.24 mbsf) is marked by a change towar d coarse-grained grainstone texture. The bioclast assemblage is composed of corals, red algae, large benthic foraminifers, and bivalves. Texture, grain size, and inclined layers indicate that these sediment s were deposited under high-energy conditions that existed on th e top of the drift fan drift sequence.  

Calcareous microfossils are present throughout the sequence, showing good preservation in the upper $100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and poor to ver y poor preservation below. The calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy suggests a late Miocene age for the bottom of the sequence. A useful sequence of biostratigraphic events through the Quaternary and early Pliocene provides a fairly clear age model that indicates a sedimentation rate of $2.6\,\mathrm{{cm}/\mathrm{{ky}}}$ throughout the succession. As observed at other Expedition 359 sites, planktonic foraminifer s in this interval consistently indicate older ages and therefore lowe r sedimentation rates than those based on calcareous nannofossils.  

IW analysis indicates that the slight increase in chloride in por e waters at Site U1472 is higher than the increase observed at Sit e U1471 but not as strong as that at Sites U1466 or U1468. This ma y be a relict signal of Last Glacial Maximum seawater that has not ye t diffused. Negligible rates of bacterial sulfate reduction relative t o advection of seawater at Site U1472 are indicated by the constan t alkalinity concentrations with depth. Neomorphism of aragonite t o LMC does not appear to occur with the same intensity as at othe r Expedition 359 sites. The high abundance of aragonite even at 20 0 mbsf is unique to this site and may be related to the general lack o f modern, active diagenesis inferred from constant pore fluid profiles. The constant alkalinity at Site U1472 also implies that th e small amounts of dolomite present in the sediments are the result o f previous episodes of alteration and are not actively forming in th e modern sediment column. Carbonate diagenesis and dolomitization must have occurred in previous time intervals but do not see m to have resulted in aragonite neomorphism to LMC.  

Measurements of the magnetic sediment properties exhibi t early vertical and negative inclinations in the uppermost 30 mbsf o f Hole U1472A that could be interpreted as a coring disturbance i n these soft and fluid-rich sediments. The rest of the inclination record, although it shows generally shallower inclination, still has  a rather erratic behavior that was not easily interpretable as a sequence of reversals.  

Because of time constraints at the end of the expedition, only  a reduced suite of physical property measurements was performed o n Site U1472 cores (primarily whole-round and split-core track measurements). Four physical properties units are observed and correlate well with the lithostratigraphic units. Physical propertie s Units 1 and 2 have high NGR values in their lower parts and decreasing values toward the top. Physical properties Units 2–4 generally show lower NGR values with little variation but some isolate d peaks of higher values. Sediment bulk density at Site U1472 increases continuously downhole, whereas there is an inversion of th e $P_{\|}$ -wave velocities below 185 mbsf. As at other sites, porosity is ver y high at the top $(>\!70\%)$ and decreases to ${\sim}50\%$ at 200 mbsf.  

For a time to depth conversion, the check shot information fro m Site U1470 was used because the sediments had similar characteristics at both sites. DS7–DS10 are sheeted; they are imaged by wellstratified continuous reflections of medium to low amplitude. Th e subhorizontal reflections of the topsets of DS4–DS6 are discontinuous to wavy at Site U1472, but the reflections become more continuous in a distal direction to the east. Whereas DS5 and DS6 ar e sheet-like, DS3 and DS4 have a divergent pattern and thicken basinward. The calibration of these seismic facies was one of the objectives for Site U1472.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I corresponds to Pleistocene DS10 an d DS9. DS8–DS5 are dominated by packstones, which become increasingly lithified with depth. The transition from lithostratigraphic Units III to IV at 224 mbsf corresponds with the DS3/DS 4 boundary and is accompanied by a significant increase in benthi c foraminifers and by more diverse skeletal components. Both DS 3 and DS4 show a characteristic chaotic reflection pattern of high amplitude that correlates well to the abundance of coarse material i n lithostratigraphic Units III and IV and layers with downcutting erosion. Both features indicate a high-energy depositional regim e within this drift sequence.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Eight sites were drilled along two transects in the Kardiva Channel in the Inner Sea of the Maldives during Expedition 359. The recovered cores retrieved material to achieve all of the objectives se t for the expedition. Beyond the acquisition of these data, coring als o revealed a series of unexpected discoveries.  

Drilling the carbonate platforms and drifts in the Maldive s aimed to recover the marine tropical record of the Neogene se a level changes and the onset of the monsoon-related current syste m in the Indian Ocean. The recovered cores and log data elucidat e both aspects with great detail. The most arresting accomplishmen t is the documentation of how the sea level–controlled carbonat e platform system thrived during the mid-Miocene Climate Optimum and abruptly transitioned into a current-dominated system i n the late middle Miocene. This transition is thought to be linked t o the onset of an early intensification of the Indian monsoon and th e coeval demise of parts of the Maldivian platform. In addition to accomplishing all of the primary objectives, four major discoverie s were made, and all are major contributions to the fields of paleoceanography, sedimentology, biostratigraphy, and geochemistry. How these objectives and the additional discoveries were achieve d is outlined below.  

# Objectives  

1. To decipher the record of Neogene environmental changes in the Maldives sediment archive.  

Cores and downhole logs allowed us to produce a solid recor d and reconstruct Neogene environmental changes in the central Indian Ocean. Site U1468 cored the entire succession from the uppe r Oligocene to Pleistocene. Deeper cores recovered illustrate how a n Oligocene neritic carbonate platform drowned and how sedimentation turned to a hemipelagic mode. Coinciding with the Oligocen e to Miocene transition, the sedimentary regime changed to a pelagi c system characterized by events with high organic accumulation. The record of the sea level–controlled lower and middle Miocen e carbonate platform was cored at Sites U1466 and U1467. The onse t of the monsoon wind–driven depositional system was cored at Site s U1466–U1468 and U1471. Preliminary shipboard analyses allo w precise dating of this major paleoclimatological and paleoceanographical change, as it also applies to the extension of the Oxyge n Minimum Zone into this part of the Indian Ocean. Coring produced a solid framework to foster postexpedition research of thes e distinct topics. We therefore regard this objective as fully accomplished.  

2. To place the Maldives current system into the larger scale ocean current framework present during Neogene global cooling and monsoon evolution.  

Seismic data from the Maldives document mounded drift packages deposited by the ocean currents that sweep through the Inne r Sea. Today these currents are linked directly to the monsoon as the y flow from west to east during the summer monsoon and reverse direction with the onset of the winter monsoon. This changing current also occurred during Expedition 359 and served as a goo d illustration of the sedimentary and oceanographic dynamics of th e archipelago. Based on seismic stratigraphy, the onset of drift deposition coincides with cessation of sea level–controlled platform progradation during the late middle Miocene global cooling phase. I f the Miocene drift deposits are related to the monsoon, as they ar e today, the onset of the drift deposits give strong evidence of the onset or at least major strengthening of the monsoon at this time. Th e biostratigraphic age model of Expedition 359 indicates a late middl e Miocene age for the onset.  

Complete spliced sections and logging at key sites during Expedition 359 provide the potential to assemble a cycle-based astrochronology for the Neogene section in the Maldives. This highresolution chronology will allow (1) assignment of independen t ages to key biostratigraphic events in the Maldives for compariso n with those from other tropical regions, (2) assignment of more precise ages for the major sequence boundaries and unconformities, and (3) evaluation of higher resolution sedimentation rate variations.  

The age of the onset of the drift deposition and thus the curren t system in this part of the Indian Ocean is essentially the same as th e onset of the Santaren Drift in the Bahamas that is formed by th e Florida Current. Initial comparison shows that not only the onse t but also the changes in sedimentation rates within the two drif t bodies are coeval. Likewise, the onset of the current across the Marion Plateau, northeast Australia, is only slightly younger based o n data from ODP Leg 194. The synchronous evolution of the drifts indicates that the onset of the current in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans was basically simultaneous. Postexpedition researc h will have to establish the extent of the lead and lag in each ocean.  

3. To obtain a continuous carbon isotopic record to calibrate a platform and platform margin record with the pelagic record.  

This objective was achieved by coring the platform tops at thre e sites (U1465, U1469, and U1470) and the entire Neogene periplatform strata at several sites at varying distances from the platform (U1468, U1467, and U1471). Together, the cored interval s provide a complete record of the carbon isotopic record of the platform and platform margin sediments. Because sedimentation rate s are high to very high in these settings, these cores provide an expanded record that will be suitable for high-resolution carbon isotope  stratigraphy.  In  the  distal  portions  of  the  progradin g clinoforms, sedimentation rates were between 3.2 and $4.4~\mathrm{cm/ky},$ and in the drift deposits, they reached $17\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ . The base of th e Neogene was penetrated at Site U1468, where the earliest Miocen e succession was a shallow-water carbonate lagoonal environmen t that developed into a somewhat deeper basin, the paleo–Inner Se a of the Maldives, with fine-grained carbonates that also contain numerous dark organic-rich intervals. Together with the sediments o f the overlying distal bottomset from the Kardiva platform in th e west, these sediments will provide a continuous carbon isotopic record to the late middle Miocene. The overlying late middle Miocen e to recent drift deposits were cored at Sites U1466–U1468 an d U1471. Each of these sites covered a different age interval with  a high sedimentation rate. Thus, the entire Neogene is cored, and w e therefore obtained an ideal data set for shore-based analysis of carbon isotopes on both the organic and inorganic fractions. This will allow the record of carbon isotope change to be extended back i n time from the approximate 8 My record, which was already measured on sediments from ODP Site 716, to ${\sim}25\,\mathrm{Ma}$ at Site U1468.  A complete comparison will be possible not only with ODP Site 1007, which penetrated the entire Miocene, but also in relation to othe r platform and pelagic records over the same time period. This comparison will allow assessment of the extent to which platform carbonates record changes in the global carbon cycle and determin e whether changes in the carbon isotopic composition of organic an d inorganic components covary and the implications this has on th e deep-time record.  

# Additional discoveries  

# 1. Organic-rich layers that indicate early Miocene oxygen minima.  

At Site U1466, coring recovered an upper Oligocene to lowe r Miocene alternation of chalky white wackestone and black organicrich layers in the lower Miocene. At Site U1468, the same facies wa s recovered above neritic carbonates with large benthic foraminifers. Here, the succession with nannofossil chalk and black organic-ric h sediments is approximately $^{90\mathrm{~m~}}$ thick. Based on their positio n within the stratigraphic succession and the estimated water depth o f the Inner Sea at the time, the presumed oxygen minima condition s necessary for their formation must have formed a relatively shallo w basin.  

# 2. The shallow nature of a carbonate contourite fan.  

Although the drift package in the Kardiva Channel was identified based on the geometries seen on the seismic data, the cores revealed a facies evolution that has far-reaching implications fo r interpretations of neritic carbonates. Together with lithologies fro m the cores, this drift is best classified as a contourite fan. No such system has been previously reported for carbonates. The reason thi s discovery will have major implications for carbonate sedimentolog y is that the facies within this drift is very similar to what has hithert o been described as, for example, neritic shoals, prograding delt a lobes, and so on. For example, Site U1468 cores from the apex of th e drift mound contain large benthic foraminiferal floatstones that resemble benthic foraminiferal shoals. Likewise, the prograding lobe s of this contourite fan are very reminiscent of what might be called  a tidal delta front. The documentation of this carbonate contourit e fan will thus trigger reinterpretation of deposits with these characteristics in the ancient.  

# 3. Advection dominance of fluid flow.  

Early diagenesis is thought to be controlled by diffusion of seawater into the underlying sediments. This diffusion-related diagenesis generally produces a characteristic depth profile of th e major anions and cations. A general lack of variation as foun d during Expedition 359 may result both from high rates of advectio n in the high-permeability drift sediments and from different geochemical profiles and carbonate diagenesis being present during th e sedimentary history. Many workers assume that the present measured pore water profile might have been similar throughout th e history of a particular site and used gradients in various element s and isotopes to calculate rates of neomorphism and recrystallization (Baker et al., 1982; Richter and DePaolo, 1987). Therefore, th e findings made during Expedition 359 question one of the basic assumptions inherent in such modeling studies.  

# 4. Planktonic foraminiferal and nannofossil biostratigraphy.  

During Expedition 359, age models were constructed with a succession of well-constrained events of calcareous nannofossils an d planktonic foraminifers, which generally were in good agreement. However, through much of the Pleistocene and Pliocene intervals i n all cores there was a consistent offset between the ages inferre d from calcareous nannofossil events and those from planktonic foraminifers, with the planktonic foraminifers suggesting ages about 0. 5 My older than the calcareous nannofossils. This persistent patter n indicates that possibly the age calibrations of these events need revision, at least for the Maldives (i.e., the central Indian Ocean).
