# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 37 2 combined two research topics: actively deforming gas hydrate– bearing landslides (IODP Proposal 841-APL) and slow slip event s on subduction faults (IODP Proposal 781A-Full). This expeditio n included a coring and logging-while-drilling (LWD) program fo r Proposal 841-APL and a LWD program for Proposal 781A-Full. Th e coring and observatory placement for Proposal 781A-Full wer e completed during Expedition 375. The Expedition 372A Proceedings volume focuses only on the results related to Proposal 841- APL. The results of the Hikurangi margin drilling are found in th e Expedition 372B/375 Proceedings volume.  

Gas hydrates have long been suspected of being involved in seafloor failure. Not much evidence, however, has been found to dat e for gas hydrate–related submarine landslides. Solid, ice-like gas hydrate in sediment pores is generally thought to increase seafloo r strength, which is confirmed by a number of laboratory measurements. Dissociation of gas hydrate to water and overpressured gas, on the other hand, may weaken and destabilize sediments, potentially causing submarine landslides.  

The Tuaheni Landslide Complex (TLC) on the Hikurangi margin shows evidence for active, creeping deformation. Intriguingly, the landward edge of creeping coincides with the pinch-out of th e base of gas hydrate stability on the seafloor. We therefore propose d that gas hydrate may be involved in creep-like deformation and presented several hypotheses that may link gas hydrates to slow deformation. Alternatively, creeping may not be related to gas hydrate s but instead be caused by repeated pressure pulses or linked t o earthquake-related liquefaction.  

Plans for Expedition 372A included a coring and LWD progra m to test our landslide hypotheses. Because of weather-related downtime, the gas hydrate–related program was reduced and we focuse d on a set of experiments at Site U1517 in the creeping part of th e TLC. We conducted a LWD and coring program to $205\;\mathrm{m}$ below th e seafloor through the TLC and the gas hydrate stability zone, followed by temperature and pressure tool deployments.  

# Introduction  

# Gas hydrates and submarine landslides  

Submarine landslides constitute a significant geohazard an d modify seafloor morphology (Mulder and Cochonat, 1996). Although progress has been made in studying their causes (Solheim e t al., 2005), the processes that control the evolution of submarin e slides are still only partially understood.  

It is generally thought that submarine slides occur as single catastrophic events leading to mobilization and downslope transpor t of source material (Mulder and Cochonat, 1996). The submarin e Tuaheni Landslide Complex (TLC) east of New Zealand’s North Island, however, exhibits features typical of active, slow-moving terrestrial earthflows that appear to be creeping rather than failing i n single events (Mountjoy et al., 2009). Such creeping behavior is observed on shore in mudslides (or earthflows) in weak clay-bearin g rock (Baum et al., 2003) and in rock glaciers in ice-bound sediment s (Martin and Whalley, 1987). At the TLC, the onset of creeping appears to be linked to the feather edge of gas hydrate stabilit y (FEGHS) where the base of gas hydrate stability (BGHS) pinches ou t at the seafloor (Mountjoy et al., 2014b). Based on the curvature o f bottom-simulating reflectors (BSRs) in the study area and BS R pinch-outs in the vicinity of the slides (Chiswell, 2005; Pecher et al., 2005, 2008), the FEGHS is predicted to occur in water depths between 585 and $640\,\mathrm{~m},$ , which coincides with the upper limit o f creeping interpreted from structural and geomorphic data.  

At the FEGHS, gas hydrates, seafloor failure, and ocean chang e are critically intertwined (Phrampus and Hornbach, 2012). Becaus e gas hydrate is known to strengthen sediments in short-term deformation tests, seafloor destabilization has been linked to hydrate dissociation, although there is no solid evidence for this process. W e suggest that the presence of gas hydrate itself may be implicated i n creeping during long-term seafloor deformation.  

# Background  

# Tectonic setting  

At the northern Hikurangi margin, the Pacific plate subduct s beneath eastern North Island, New Zealand, at a rate of 4.5–5. 5 $\mathrm{cm/y}$ (Wallace et al., 2004; Figure F1). The oceanic subducting plat e includes the Hikurangi Plateau, a rough-crust, seamount-studde d large igneous province of Cretaceous age $(120\mathrm{-}90\mathrm{\;Ma)}$ ). The platea u is overlain by a Cenozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary sequence tha t thickens from ${\sim}1$ to $1.5~\mathrm{km}$ at the northern Hikurangi margin an d thickens to $>\!5\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{~km~}}$ at the southern Hikurangi margin, south o f ${\sim}40^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ . Thus, the northern Hikurangi margin is relatively sedimen t starved. This part of the margin is characterized by a mixed mode o f spatially varying tectonic accretion and frontal tectonic erosion associated with subducting seamounts (Lewis et al., 1998; Collot et al., 2001; Pedley et al., 2010; Barker et al., 2009, 2018). The past subduction of seamounts may have an effect on fluid pressures at th e plate interface (Bell et al., 2010; Ellis et al., 2015). Fluid expulsion, potentially related to subduction of seamounts, has been implicate d in observed thermal anomalies that disturb the gas hydrate stabilit y field near the TLC (e.g., Pecher et al., 2017).  

# Geologic setting of the Tuaheni Landslide Complex  

The TLC is situated on the upper slope of the Hikurangi margi n (Figure F2). The outer shelf and upper slope are underlain by Quaternary shelf-edge clinoform sequences (Pedley et al., 2010). Thes e clinoforms consist of wedge-shaped sedimentary packages that ar e characteristic of sea level cycle–controlled progradational deposit s (e.g., Posamentier and Vail, 1988; Van Wagoner et al., 1988). Th e clinoform sequences are fine grained at the surface (Alexander e t al., 2010) but are likely to contain a significant sand fraction at  a depth similar to sequences identified in the vicinity of the TL C (Barnes et al., 1991). Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic rocks beneath th e Quaternary sections have been exposed following tectonic uplif t and erosion (Field et al., 1997; Barnes et al., 2002; Mountjoy an d Barnes, 2011).  

Dissociation of gas hydrates has long been proposed as a mechanism responsible for seafloor failure, mainly because of (1) “melting” of a potentially frame-supporting or cementing solid to wate r and (2) net volume expansion leading to elevated pore pressur e caused by the generation of free gas (Kvenvolden, 1993; Mienert e t al., 1998). Conversely, a number of laboratory experiments hav e shown that gas hydrate strengthens sediments (e.g., Winters et al., 2004; Priest et al., 2005). Most studies into the role of gas hydrates i n seafloor instability have thus focused on the BGHS, where gas hydrate dissociates. A few recent findings, however, indicate that ga s hydrates may directly or indirectly contribute to seafloor weakening. Rock Garden, a ridge on the Hikurangi margin with a flat to p flanked by BSRs, appears to be eroded at the predicted FEGH S (Pecher et al., 2005). It has been proposed that gas hydrate indirectl y causes seafloor weakening because a reduction of permeabilit y caused by the presence of gas hydrate may lead to the buildup o f overpressure and hydrofracturing of the seafloor (Crutchley et al., 2010; Ellis et al., 2010). Furthermore, although earlier laborator y tests suggest that gas hydrate itself, unlike ice, does not exhibit an y viscous behavior (Durham et al., 2003), laboratory measurement s on sands from the Nankai Trough indicate that gas hydrates may facilitate long-term deformation (Miyazaki et al., 2011). At the TLC, we see evidence that gas buildup and fracturing or viscous processe s may occur in nature.

The TLC is thought to have initially formed as a catastrophi c submarine slide (the parent slide) followed by ongoing slow deformation of the slide mass. The flanking by elongated strike-slip fault s is evidence for slow deformation. The lower edge of the slide mass i s unconfined. Morphology of faults in seismic data shows compressional features in the upper part of the slide mass, whereas the lowe r part shows characteristics of an extensional regime. These observations point toward a conveyor-belt model for sediment movemen t through the slides, where sediments are being supplied into the up

per slide mass, leading to compression, and are being removed a t the toe of the TLC, similar to mudslides and rock glaciers on lan d (Mountjoy et al., 2009).  

It was originally suggested that slow deformation in the TLC reflects repeated small-scale seafloor failure associated with localize d charging and discharging of pore pressure (Mountjoy et al., 2009 ) without involvement of gas hydrates. This process would lead t o successions of small-scale compressional and extensional features.  

We have, however, observed a general switch from compressional to extensional regimes at ${\sim}600\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth with compression above it and extension, indicating creeping, beneath it (Figur e F3). This water depth coincides with the predicted FEGHS. W e therefore hypothesized that gas hydrates may cause creeping in th e TLC (Mountjoy et al., 2014b). The three proposed mechanisms behind creeping include sliding at the BGHS following gas hydrat e dissociation, repeated “breaching” of a permeability boundary at th e BGHS that leads to transmission of pressure pulses beneath th e creeping part of the slides (“hydrate pressure valve”), and viscou s behavior of gas hydrate–bearing sediments (“hydrate glacier” ) (Mountjoy et al., 2014b) (Figure F4).

# Seismic studies/site survey data  

The key multichannel seismic data set available in support of th e TLC drilling program was a P‐Cable 3-D seismic reflection surve y collected during Survey TAN1404 (Mountjoy et al., 2014a). Interpretation of these data confirmed that the transition from a compressional to extensional (creeping) regime generally coincides wit h the predicted FEGHS. The 3-D seismic cube provided detailed images of the architecture of the TLC (Gross et al., 2018). The following horizons were interpreted beneath the site (Figure F5):  

• A possible décollement for creeping at 0.043 s two-way traveltime (TWT) beneath the seafloor (37 meters below seafloor [mbsf] for subseafloor interval velocity of $1700\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ ), • The base of the debris mass at 0.069 s TWT (59 mbsf), and • The BGHS at $0.190\;\mathrm{s}$ TWT (162 mbsf). The BGHS is mostly defined by the termination of high-amplitude reflections, although BSRs appear in patches along the level of the BGHS.  

These data were augmented by deep penetration, high-fold seismic sections (Survey 05CM; up to $12\,\mathrm{km}$ streamer), low-fold (up t o 48 channel) data collected by New Zealand research institute s during two surveys in 2011 (TAN1114) (Barnes and TAN 1114 Scientific Party, 2011) and 2012 (TAN1213), and low-fold high-resolution 2-D multichannel data acquired using the P‐Cable seismi c streamers in a 2-D configuration during Survey TAN1404 (Mountjoy et al., 2014a). A long-offset seismic profile, which should provid e improved velocity information across Site U1517 (proposed Sit e TLC-04B), was collected by the R/V Marcus G. Langseth (Cruis e MGL 1708) as part of the Seismogenesis at Hikurangi Integrate d Research Experiment (SHIRE) project shortly before Expeditio n 372.  

# Previous drilling of the Tuaheni Landslide Complex Two sites were drilled in April–May 2016 in the TLC to ${\sim}80$ mbsf during the R/V Sonne Voyage SO-247 using the Meeresboden

Bohrgerät 200 (MeBo) robotic drilling system (Site GeoB20831 a t Site U1517 and Site GeoB20803 near proposed Site TLC-01D ) (Huhn, 2016).  

Site U1517 (Figure F5) was drilled to ${\sim}80$ mbsf with the MeB o system (Site GeoB20831) (Huhn, 2016), encountering deforme d clayey silt in the upper $28\textrm{m}$ with good core recovery. Between 2 8 and 60 mbsf, recovery was poor and yielded very fine sandy coars e silt in sections as long as $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ (per $3.5\;\mathrm{m}$ stroke length). The core s were highly disturbed by the drilling process and mixed with seawater. From 60 to 78.8 mbsf, stiff clayey silt was sampled from th e bedded sedimentary sequence underlying the landslide complex, with good core recovery. The second MeBo site in the TLC (Sit e GeoB20803) was drilled ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ from our proposed alternate Sit e TLC-01D and yielded similar lithologies, with poor recovery in th e upper part of the hole.  

MeBo drilling was not successful at recovering material acros s the interpreted décollement at ${\sim}40$ mbsf in the seismic data. However, lithologies in the upper and lower parts of the MeBo core s were different, suggestive of a lithologic change across this interpreted décollement. Poor core recovery and extensive seawater contamination precluded pore water analysis for chlorinity as a ga s hydrate proxy. MeBo drilling allowed borehole data to be tied t o seismic reflections from the intact sequences below landslide debris.  

# Objectives  

# Tuaheni Landslide Complex: hypotheses and scientific objectives  

We planned to test the following hypotheses that may link ga s hydrates to creeping:  

• Hypothesis 1: overpressure may lead to slow sliding at the BGHS, in a modification of conventional models linking gas hydrates to seafloor instability (Phrampus and Hornbach, 2012; Figure F4A).   
• Hypothesis 2: overpressure at the BGHS causes hydrofracturing, facilitating transmission of overpressure into the gas hydrate zone and sediment weakening, similar to mechanisms proposed for seafloor erosion on Rock Garden south of the TLC (Pecher et al., 2005; Crutchley et al., 2010) (hydrate pressure valve; Figure F4B).   
• Hypothesis 3: interstitial gas hydrates in sediments within the TLC slide mass may cause creeping deformation, perhaps because of ice-like viscous behavior of hydrates (hydrate glacier; Figure F4C).  

Antitheses (i.e., mechanisms that do not involve gas hydrates ) include the following:  

• Antithesis 1: creeping in the TLC could be caused by repeated small-scale failure associated with buildup and release of overpressure, the originally proposed mechanism behind creeping (Mountjoy et al., 2009).   
• Antithesis 2: earthquake-related liquefaction of coarse silt beds, as detected during recent MeBo drilling, facilitates downslope movement.  

Our program was designed to distinguish between the propose d hypotheses based on their following key manifestations:  

• Hypothesis 1 (sliding at the BGHS): the key process controlling creeping would be elevated pressure at the BGHS. Temperature  

profiles will be important to reconstruct past pressure-temperature disturbances that may be causing ongoing gas hydrate dissociation and resulting overpressure.   
• Hypothesis 2 (hydrate pressure valve): overpressure is present at the BGHS and transmitted into the gas hydrate stability zone. The presence of a fracture network above the BGHS allows transmission of overpressure to the décollement, which facilitates creeping. No such fracture networks would be expected in the compressional part of the TLC.   
• Hypothesis 3 (hydrate glacier): gas hydrate saturation would be expected to change across the décollement. Compressional and extensional parts of the slides would not show any significant differences in terms of pore pressure or fractures.  

The antitheses would not predict any anomalies linked to ga s hydrate saturation, in particular no pressure disruption at th e BGHS or fracture networks related to gas hydrates. The two proposed mechanisms would otherwise have different signatures:  

• Antithesis 1 (repeated small-scale seafloor failure): elevated pore pressure would be expected in the compressional regime (pressure charging) compared to the extensional zone (discharged). • Antithesis 2 (liquefaction of coarse silt beds): cores might reveal localized shearing and liquefaction within the shear zone.  

We planned to obtain the necessary data for distinguishing between our proposed creeping mechanisms by achieving the following objectives through drilling the TLC.  

1. Obtain lithologic information within the creeping slides, in particular across the proposed décollement of creeping.  

Coring was planned to obtain information on the litholog y within the creeping, extensional part of the TLC and the underlyin g sediments. Recovering cores across the proposed décollement fo r creeping, from which MeBo drilling did not obtain any cores, was  a high priority. Lithologic information using the R/V JOIDES Resolution’s advanced piston corer (APC) and half-length APC (HLAPC ) systems will be extrapolated based on seismic data.  

# 2. Collect samples for shore-based laboratory studies.  

The microscopic distribution of gas hydrate in sediments and it s interaction with the sediment frame may be highly dependent o n porosity distribution and sediment composition (e.g., the presenc e of clay minerals). We planned to test whether and how creepin g may be linked to viscous behavior of the hydrate-sediment mix b y conducting laboratory measurements on material recovered fro m the TLC. Gas hydrates may be formed in intact or reconstitute d sediments from APC or HLAPC cores.  

# 3. Constrain in situ gas hydrate saturation and composition.  

Gas hydrate saturation with depth is a key parameter to addres s all three proposed hydrate-related creep mechanisms. We planne d to constrain profiles of gas hydrate saturation with depth based o n logging-while-drilling (LWD) and pore water chlorinity data fro m APC and HLAPC cores. Degassing of pressure cores was planne d for additional calibration of gas hydrate saturation and for determination of the hydrate-forming gas composition. The gas composition is important for hydrate stability calculations and improve d understanding of the general gas and gas hydrate system at the TLC. Furthermore, pore water profiles provide information on flui d sources and chemical disequilibria.  

# 4. Obtain pore pressure and temperature profiles.  

Both models of the hydrate pressure valve and sliding at the BGHS involve pore pressure anomalies. In addition, the antithesis of repeated small-scale sliding at the BGHS without gas hydrate involvement is predicted to have a characteristic pressure signature. Pore pressure profiles are particularly important in the creeping extensional regime, where we planned a program using the temperature dual-pressure probe (T2P) to calibrate pore pressure. Emphasis was on pore pressure changes across the proposed décollement and the BGHS. Temperature profiles are needed to constrain gas hydrate stability. Furthermore, changes in paleo–bottom water temperatures are a possible cause for gas hydrate dissociation leading to overpressure and sliding at the BGHS. Such bottom water changes would be reflected in anomalous temperature profiles with depth. We planned to measure subseafloor temperatures with the third generation advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) and the sediment temperature pressure tool (SETP).  

# 5. Search for evidence of fracturing.  

The hydrate pressure valve model predicts transmission of pore pressure through fractures from hydraulic or pneumatic fracturing. We planned to constrain sediment fracturing as a function of depth at all three sites based on LWD data, particularly the resistivity images.  

# 6. Calibrate seismic data.  

Further quantitative analysis of the 3-D seismic data will aim at constraining potential lateral pressure variation along the décollement and deeper layers. Results from LWD velocity logs, tied with pressure profiles, will allow calibration of the seismic data. Furthermore, the LWD data may also provide shear wave calibration for long-offset seismic lines (MacMahon, 2016) and ocean-bottom seismometer site survey data (Wild, 2016) with the aim of extracting subsurface S-wave velocities using amplitude versus offset and $P_{\|}$ -to$S$ converted waves.  

# Principal results Site U1517  

Site U1517 is located in the extensional, creeping part of the TLC at ${\sim}720~\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figures F2, F3). The primary drilling objectives were to use LWD and sample through the landslide mass and the gas hydrate stability zone to understand the mechanisms behind creeping.  

The site was selected based on 3-D site survey data and was previously drilled to 80 mbsf with the MeBo system (Site GeoB20831) during Sonne Voyage SO-247. See Objectives for site objectives.  

Hole U1517A was drilled to 205 mbsf with LWD starting on 16 December 2017. The vessel was offset by $20\textrm{m}$ for Hole U1517B, which was abandoned because of uncertainties in the position of the mudline. Hole U1517C was drilled at the same location as Hole U1517B for APC/HLAPC coring and reached 188.5 mbsf. The vessel then left Site U1517 for completion of the remaining LWD program for the Hikurangi margin before returning to the site on 31 December to drill Hole U1517D for T2P/SETP deployments (Table T1).  

# Core lithology and structure  

The lithostratigraphy in Hole U1517C is characterized as clayey silt with sandy intervals (Figure F6). We defined five lithostratigraphic units (I–V) based on visual description of core material, smear slide analysis, and red-green-blue (RGB) color and magnetic susceptibility logs. Smear slide analysis shows that Units I–IV have distinct characteristics with an overall decrease in grain size downcore from Unit I to Unit IV, whereas Unit V includes a broad distribution of grain sizes. A variety of drilling-related core disturbance occurred that made robust interpretation of sedimentary structure challenging. Sedimentary structures including sharp upper contacts and irregular basal contacts in graded beds suggest that significant postdepositional modification of the beds has taken place. Overall, we interpret this stratigraphic succession as including bedded turbidite sequences, mass transport deposits (MTDs), and background hemipelagic sedimentation. The upper ${\sim}67\;\mathrm{m}$ is within the TLC and appears to be primarily an intact block that likely mobilized from the upper slope sedimentary sequences.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers were examined from core catcher samples and additional split-core samples to develop a shipboard biostratigraphic framework for Site U1517. Benthic foraminifers were also examined to provide data on paleowater depths and downslope reworking.  

A Holocene to middle Pleistocene sedimentary sequence was recovered at Site U1517. The base of the Holocene is placed at $3.34-$ 4.92 mbsf, at the level of a lithologic change from relatively soft (featureless) bioturbated silty claystone to a compacted thin-bedded silty claystone sequence and at an abrupt shift in physical properties. The underlying section is Middle to Late Pleistocene in age $(11{-}530\;\mathrm{ka})$ . From biostratigraphic dating, the average sedimentation rate for Site U1517 is estimated to be ${\sim}0.8\mathrm{~m/ky}.$ .  

# Paleomagnetism  

We measured paleomagnetic inclination, declination, and intensity records of natural remanent magnetization (NRM). Site U1517 sections were demagnetized to a peak field of 20 or $30~\mathrm{mT}$ Measured NRM inclination shows a pervasive overprint along core that manifests in steeply dipping and downward facing inclinations and most likely represents a viscous remanent magnetization acquired during the drilling process. This overprint was successfully removed at the 10 or $20\:\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization level.

In Lithostratigraphic Units I–IV, core recovery was high and al l sections were largely undisturbed so that depositional remanence s were adequately preserved. However, a slight deformation along th e core liners (or “bed drag”) often resulted in a slight concave curvature of the bedding that may have affected the recorded remanenc e directions.  

NRM intensity prior to demagnetization ranged from $4\times10^{-3}$ t o $0.1\,\mathrm{\A/m}$ . Peak values coincided with sand-bearing units encountered in Lithostratigraphic Units I and V and are coherent with th e higher magnetic susceptibility values measured in these intervals.  

The entire sequence recovered at Site U1517 yields NRM directions with upward-facing (negative) inclinations following demagnetization to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ . Preliminary biostratigraphic datums sugges t that the material at this site is no older than $0.53\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , and we thu s infer that the depositional remanences measured were acquire d during the Brunhes Normal Chron (C1n) (Gradstein et al., 2012).  

# Geochemistry  

We collected 75 whole-round samples for characterization o f the pore water in Hole U1517C. Samples were collected on the catwalk at a frequency of four samples per core in the upper $15.2\,\mathrm{m}$ an d two samples per core from 15.2 to 112.4 mbsf. Below this depth, sample selection was guided by cold anomalies observed in infrare d camera images that suggested the potential for gas hydrate occurrence. Additional samples were taken away from the cold anomalie s to establish the in situ background chloride concentrations. Dissolved chloride measurements indicate the presence of discrete ga s hydrate occurrences between ${\sim}135$ and 165 mbsf, with hydrate saturation $(S_{\mathrm{h}})$ values ranging from $2\%$ to $68\%$ . This distribution is consistent with inferences on gas hydrate saturation based on resistivit y data obtained by LWD. When it was possible to isolate thin, dark, coarse silt layers from the background fine clay matrix, we analyze d each lithology separately. In these separated samples, the thi n coarse layers within the whole-round host gas hydrate at saturation s ranging from $5\%$ to $50\%$ , whereas gas hydrate in the fine clay immediately in contact with the gas hydrate–bearing, coarse-graine d layers ranged from nondetectable to $2\%$ . This illustrates the preferential occurrence of gas hydrate in the coarse-grained material.  

Pore fluid composition reflects the combined effects of microbially mediated organic matter degradation coupled to carbonat e and silica diagenetic changes. The sulfate–methane transitio n (SMT) is well defined at 17 mbsf by depletion of dissolved sulfat e and a marked increase in methane concentration in headspace samples. Alkalinity, calcium, and magnesium show distributions tha t are typical for reactions occurring at the SMT. Pore water profiles i n the methanogenic zone suggest a combination of reactions that ma y include silicate weathering and formation of authigenic mineral s that modify the iron, manganese, calcium, and potassium pore water profiles.  

Below the SMT, methane concentrations rapidly increase to a s much as $1\%$ , indicating ongoing methanogenesis. The measure d methane concentrations below the SMT are close to or above por e water saturation at ambient conditions. These values are qualitativ e estimates only because they reflect the amount of gas remaining i n the sediment after core recovery and handling rather than the original values. Ethane was not detected in gas samples from the headspace nor from voids shallower than 146 mbsf, but it was repeatedl y measured at very low concentrations of 1–2 parts per million b y volume (ppmv) between 146 and 166 mbsf, a depth range that coincides with the inferred presence of gas hydrate. No other higher-order hydrocarbons were detected.  

Solid-phase analyses yielded $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ contents ranging from 4.6 3 to $8.99~\mathrm{wt\%}$ $(\mathrm{mean}\,=\,6.52\,\pm\,1.13~\mathrm{wt}\%)$ . Total organic carbon contents are generally $<\!1\mathrm{\wt\%}$ , with slightly higher concentrations i n  

Lithostratigraphic Unit IV $(\mathrm{mean}=0.71\pm0.16\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ organic carbo n within this unit) and a few measurements that reached $1.68\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ i n Unit V. The C/N ratios ranged from 3.78 to 31.34 (mean $=9.46~\pm$ 3.52), with variations that suggest higher heterogeneity of the organic matter in Units II and V.  

Based on infrared anomalies, 13 whole rounds that likely contained gas hydrates were removed from the core at the catwalk. These samples were immediately stored in liquid nitrogen for shipment to the GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (Germany), Qingda o Institute of Marine Geology (China), and British Geological Survey, where shore-based gas hydrate studies will be conducted.  

# Physical properties  

Physical properties were characterized through a set of measurements on whole cores, split cores, and discrete samples. Th e magnetic susceptibility profile generally corresponds to the lithostratigraphic units, with sequences of sand and mud showing mor e variable magnetic susceptibility than laminated clay and silt or massive silty clay. Moisture and density (MAD) measurements on discrete samples from cores indicate relatively low porosity $\left({\sim}0.44\right)$ starting a few meters below the seafloor (Figure F6). A porosity shif t occurs at 66 mbsf, with values increasing to ${\sim}0.48$ . $P_{\|}$ -wave velocit y and strength measurements on cores were compromised or prevented by expansion caused by gas disturbance deeper than 2 0 mbsf. Thermal conductivity measurements yield values averagin g $1.2\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K})$ in the cored section. Fluctuations in thermal conductivity are small and appear inversely related to porosity, which is expected based on the higher thermal conductivity of solids.  

# Downhole measurements  

The APCT-3 was deployed seven times in Hole U1517C. Fou r successful deployments between 81 and 132 mbsf define a linea r temperature-depth profile with a gradient of $39.8^{\circ}C/\mathrm{km}$ . This gradient, combined with the average thermal conductivity measured o n cores, yields an estimate of vertical conductive heat flow of 4 9 $\mathrm{{mW/m^{2}}}$ .  

Four attempts were made to measure in situ formation pressur e and temperature in Hole U1517D. The T2P was deployed at 80 an d $120\;\mathrm{mbsf}.$ . The first deployment returned a good formation pressur e measurement. The second deployment may have collected goo d data, but it could not be retrieved because the electronics flooded. The SETP was deployed at 130 and 168.7 mbsf. Tool deploymen t and recovery went smoothly; however, the data file of the first measurement was erased from the memory card and the data file of th e second measurement was corrupted. Post-expedition efforts to recover these data were unsuccessful.  

# Logging while drilling  

LWD tools collected data in Hole U1517A to the target depth o f 205 mbsf (Table T1). Five LWD tools were deployed on the bottomhole assembly (BHA): geoVISION, SonicScope, NeoScope, TeleScope, and proVISION. These provided data in real time and recorded modes through the TLC, across and below the décollement, and through the BSR. Based on the LWD measurements, five mai n logging units were identified that closely correspond to the lithostratigraphic units defined for Hole U1517C (Figure F6). Severa l significant features were interpreted from the logs, such as the compacted base of the debris flow from 54 to 60 mbsf and natural ga s hydrate occurring in $10{-}30~\mathrm{cm}$ thick turbidite sands from 110 t o 150 mbsf. Both conductive and resistive fractures were also identified throughout the hole, with a higher fracture density within th e landslide complex. Gas hydrate occurrences were predicted base d on resistivity anomalies between 113.0 and 145.5 mbsf.  

# Core-log integration  

By integrating LWD data from Hole U1517A and core-derive d information from Hole U1517C, we compared LWD data wit h physical property measurements on core (natural gamma radiatio n [NGR], sonic $P$ -wave velocity, porosity, and bulk density). Wholeround NGR measurements are in agreement with those take n through LWD. Additionally, core sample–derived MAD porositie s agree well with measured LWD nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR ) porosities, but MAD measurements are consistently lower than th e LWD neutron porosity measurements (Figure F6). Furthermore, the depths at which significant changes in measurement response s occur appear slightly mismatched: in the shallow section above 7 0 mbsf, excursions from baseline values appear approximately $5\,\textrm{m}$ lower in core data than LWD data. This observation is consisten t across both the NGR and porosity measurements. This mismatch i s less pronounced deeper in the holes.  

Hydrate saturation was estimated using LWD-based method s and core geochemistry analysis. These techniques agree in their assessment of the most probable areas of hydrate occurrence, although they disagree in their predictions of hydrate saturatio n magnitude, which is likely due to differences in sampling resolutio n and formation heterogeneity.  

# Log-seismic integration  

LWD logs were tied to the In-line 1778 profile of the Tuaheni 3- D seismic volume through a set of synthetic seismograms (Figur e F6). Two sets of synthetics were constructed. One set edited th e LWD density and velocity logs to create acoustic impedance log s that were convolved with a wavelet derived from the seafloor reflection in the seismic data. The other set used a log-lithologic model o f the main lithostratigraphic units and physical properties. Washout s caused by silty/sandy lithologies led to relatively poor quality of th e density and velocity logs in these intervals. Therefore, the syntheti c seismograms did not match the seismic reflection data well. Nevertheless, we were able to tie the main lithostratigraphic and loggin g units to the seismic units.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment Tuaheni Landslide Complex  

The primary drilling goal for the TLC was to understand th e mechanisms behind the slow deformation of the landslides an d their proposed links to gas hydrates by logging and samplin g through the landslide mass and the gas hydrate stability zone.  

Operationally, we originally planned to conduct LWD surveys a t three sites: the main Site U1517 in the extensional, creeping part o f the TLC, a site in the compressional part of the TLC above th e BGHS pinch-out (planned primary Site TLC-02C), and a referenc e site outside the slide mass (planned primary Site TLC-03B). W e planned to core Site U1517 with the APC/HLAPC system and deploy the T2P/SETP to measure pore pressure and temperature an d the pressure core sampler (PCS) to collect sediment cores unde r pressure for calibration of gas hydrate saturation and for gas hydrat e composition. This plan would allow a comprehensive study of th e creeping part of the TLC and comparison with both its compressional part and gas hydrates in the vicinity but outside the slid e mass. Because of significant downtime because of poor weather an d a delayed departure from Fremantle, Australia, we focused all ou r operations on the main site (U1517), conducting LWD, coring, an d a reduced number of T2P/SETP stations, skipping the other tw o sites. This compromise aimed to minimize the impact of reduce d operational time on addressing our scientific goals.  

# Meeting the objectives of the expedition: Tuaheni Landslide Complex  

We consider the TLC program overall successful in terms of allowing us to test our hypotheses and antitheses despite the significant downtime we experienced. Importantly, we were able t o complete almost the entire planned program at the main sit e (U1517). We were not, however, able to log either the site in th e compressional part of the slides (proposed Site TLC-02C) or th e reference site outside the slide mass (proposed Site TLC-03B). Results from gas hydrate occurrences in the deeper preslide mass interval at Site U1517, combined with the detection of gas hydrates a t Site U1519 (Barnes et al., 2019), should allow us to interpret result s from Site U1517 without a reference site. Extension of results fro m Site U1517 based on recently acquired long-offset 2-D seismic dat a should also alleviate the lack of LWD in the compressional part o f the slide. We were fortunate to still be able to deploy the T2P an d SETP in a very limited time window at the end of the expedition. One of the two T2P deployments successfully provided a reading o f formation pressure. Unfortunately, SETP data could not be recovered. We could not deploy the PCS because of time constraints. Pressure coring would have improved constraints on gas hydrat e saturation and composition. We are confident that we were able t o get accurate and continuous profiles of gas hydrate saturation because of the high quality of the LWD data. The recovered gas hydrate  samples  should  provide  information  on  gas  hydrat e composition.  

We have largely achieved the following scientific objectives:  

1. Obtain lithologic information within the creeping slides, in particular across the proposed décollement of creeping. We had ${>}90\%$ core recovery, with the only major gaps occurring below the BGHS, probably due to gas expansion.   
2. Collect samples for shore-based laboratory studies. This objective relates to gas hydrate studies. In addition to the gas hydrate–bearing samples, we collected a number of whole rounds and sediment samples for laboratory studies involving artificial gas hydrate formation followed by geomechanical measurements.   
3. Constrain in situ gas hydrate saturation and composition. Because of the generally high quality of logs and good core recovery, including retrieval of gas hydrate samples, we are confident this objective has been achieved for Site U1517.   
4. Obtain pore pressure and temperature profiles. We were able to measure the temperature gradient above the BGHS. We successfully measured formation pressure at a critical depth near the base of the landslide debris. We were not able to retrieve data from a second T2P deployment nor any information from the SETP. Nevertheless, the successful measurements significantly enhance our constraints on pressure and temperature profiles.   
5. Search for evidence of fracturing. Resistivity images from LWD will allow us to detect fracturing at Site U1517. Although we will not be able to compare fracture patterns with those in the compressional region of the slides, we may still be able to gain some information on changes in any fracture patterns from the seismic data and core computed tomography (CT) imagery.  

6. Calibrate seismic data. The logs should provide full calibration of the short-streamer 3-D seismic site survey at Site U1517. Canceling two additional holes in the 3-D cube will increase uncertainties in inversion approaches away from Site U1517, but this effect is partly alleviated by the acquisition of a longstreamer seismic line across Site U1517 by Marcus G. Langseth in November and December 2017, which will enhance constraints away from the borehole.  

Furthermore, by industry standards, the LWD data were collected in relatively shallow sediments. Post-expedition researc h subsequently includes development of LWD validation, characterization, and methodology in these settings.  

In terms of studying the processes behind active deformation i n the TLC, LWD- and laboratory-based physical properties indicat e consistent variation between the landslide debris mass and underlying sediment. Disequilibrium profiles from geochemical result s through the TLC reflect temporal elements of the depositional structure of the system. Core lithologies are dominated by grade d fine sandy beds and clayey silts, including many turbidites. Thes e results, combined with core-log and seismic integration that provides petrophysical properties within the slide mass and surrounding lithologies, provide an exceptional framework for analyzin g active landslide processes.  

In a broader sense, the nearly full recovery of cores through th e landslide and the gas hydrate zone provides us with a good record o f sedimentology, lithology, physical properties, and geochemistry. The LWD data are generally of high quality, providing importan t structural and geophysical information, as well as calibration for th e various seismic data sets covering the TLC. We are thus confiden t that post-expedition analyses will allow us to unravel the processe s leading to “creeping” of the TLC—the primary aim for Site U1517.
