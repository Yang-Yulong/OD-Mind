# Abstract  

The North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans are unquestionably major players in the climatic evolutio n of the Northern Hemisphere and in the history of the meridional overturning circulation of th e Atlantic Ocean. The establishment of the modern North Atlantic Water (NAW) transporting heat, salt, and moisture to the Northern Hemisphere has been indicated as one of the main forcin g mechanisms for the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation. NAW controls the extent an d dynamics of circum-Arctic and circum-North Atlantic ice sheets and sea ice in addition to dee p water and brine production. How the ocean system and cryosphere worked during past warme r intervals of high insulation and/or high atmospheric $C O_{2}$ content is still largely unknown an d debated. The required information can only be attained by offshore scientific drilling in highresolution continuous expanded sedimentary sequences identified on the western continenta l margin of Svalbard (and eastern side of the Fram Strait) along the main pathway and norther n penetration of the NAW flowing into the Arctic Ocean. The area around Svalbard is very sensitiv e to climatic variability and can be considered a sentinel of climate change. Furthermore, the reconstruction of the dynamic history of the marine-based paleo-Svalbard–Barents Sea Ice Sheet i s important because it is considered the best available analog to the modern, marine-based Wes t Antarctic Ice Sheet, for which the loss of stability is presently the major uncertainty in projectin g future global sea level rise in response to the present global climate warming.  

# Plain language summary  

The Fram Strait is an important gateway for ocean currents to flow between the North Atlanti c and Arctic Oceans. The northward-flowing current system plays critical roles in regional an d global climate change because of the heat, salt, and moisture it brings to the Arctic region, whic h influence the formation and melting of ice sheets and sea ice, as well as the overturning circulatio n of the ocean itself. Thick deposits of ocean sediments (sediment drifts) have accumulated ove r millions of years under the effect of the warm current flowing along the seafloor in the easter n Fram Strait. Shaped by the bottom current and fed by the input of marine biological activity an d sediments delivered by advancing and retreating glaciers on the nearby continental margin, sediment drifts contain the record of the past (paleo) oceanographic and climatic changes tha t occurred over millions of years. The dynamic history of ocean-ice interactions during global climate transitions, such as the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation, and past periods of rapi d warming and higher $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ levels than today, can be reconstructed from the detailed record contained in these sediment drifts. These paleoclimate data are valuable for groundtruthing climat e models of projected future $C O_{2},$ temperature, and ice sheet stability.  

# 1. Introduction  

The Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans are unquestionably major players in the climatic evolutio n of the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., Overland et al., 2011, Mahajan et al., 2011). Many uncertaintie s remain about the establishment, evolution, and role of the northern North Atlantic–Arctic Ocea n circulation in relation to the opening of the Fram Strait and its impact on Earth’s global climat e during the major climatic transitions that occurred since the late Miocene. Further, the linkag e among changes in insolation, atmospheric ${\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ levels, ocean dynamics, and the cryosphere in th e past and in the future remains unclear. A present major concern is the impact that meltwate r release from Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets under the ongoing global climate warming wil l have at regional to global scales. The Arctic is currently experiencing temperature changes that ar e two to four times faster than the global average (Stocker et al., 2013; Rantanen et al., 2022). Numerical simulations of past and current Greenland ice sheet melting have indicated the meltwaters’ potential to slow the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) (Rahmstorf e t al., 2015; Turney et al., 2020). The weakening of the AMOC was shown to induce a bipolar seesa w by transferring the heat to Southern high latitudes, accelerating the demise of the West Antarcti c Ice Sheet (WAIS) during the last interglacial (Turney et al., 2020). Antarctic ice sheet meltin g could then cause a cooling and a drying in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes due to a reduction of Antarctic Bottom Water formation as one of major drivers of the AMOC (Golledge et al., 2019). Reconstructing the dynamic history of ocean and ice sheet interactions along the wester n margin of Svalbard and eastern side of the Fram Strait at the gateway to the Arctic is key to understanding the linkage among insolation, atmospheric $C O_{2}$ concentration, ocean circulation, and ic e sheet dynamics.

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 403 (Figure F1) was motivated by th e necessity of retrieving continuous, high-resolution, and datable depositional sequences containin g the record of the paleoceanographic characteristics and cryosphere evolution during past ke y climatic transitions that followed the opening of the Fram Strait. Such data are greatly needed t o generate a frame of information to better constrain global climate connections, forcing mechanisms, and climate models.  

# 2. Background  

# 2.1. Modern oceanography and climate  

The Fram Strait is the only deepwater ${\sqrt{\sim\!2600\ {\mathrm{m}}\,}}$ passage between the Arctic and the subpola r oceans, and it is crossed by two opposite oceanic currents (Figure F2). North Atlantic Wate r (NAW) flows into the Arctic via the West Spitsbergen Current (WSC), which is the northernmos t branch of the North Atlantic Current, delivering heat, salt, and moisture to the Arctic Ocean (Teigen et al., 2010; Agarwal and Worster, 2017). The heat from the WSC is the primary control on ai r temperature over Svalbard and is the primary control enabling nearly sea ice–free conditions i n the winter months in the eastern Fram Strait (western Svalbard margin). In contrast, cold, lowsalinity water masses are brought southward along the western side of the Fram Strait by the Eas t Greenland Current (EGC), which is responsible for the sea ice coverage along East Greenland an d contributes to the stability of the Greenland Ice Sheet.  

The WSC is a bathymetrically controlled boundary current that hugs the continental slope o f western Svalbard, flowing at an average rate of $30~\mathrm{cm/s}$ approximately along the $1000\;\mathrm{m}$ isobat h (Beszczynska‐Möller et al., 2012; Bensi et al., 2019). The current transports to the north bot h NAW, which is a subsurface water mass located between 300–400 and $800{-}1000\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth, and the Norwegian Sea Deep Water (NSDW), located below $1200\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth. The NAW is  a saline ( ${\sim}35.5$ ppt; MOSJ, 2023) and warm water mass, $2^{\circ}{-}6^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in the summer and $2^{\circ}{-}4^{\circ}C$ in th e winter (von Appen et al., 2016; Beszczynska-Möller et al., 2012). It is estimated that the shallo w core of the WSC composed of NAW loses $300\;\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ in the summer and $1000\;\mathrm{W/m^{2}}$ in the winter, having a strong impact on the Arctic Ocean heat balance (Saloranta and Haugan, 2004). In addition to seasonal differences in temperature and heat loss, the WSC also exhibits seasonal cycles o f stratification, velocity, and stability. Wintertime cooling and stronger winds lead to weaker stratification (greater convection), stronger flow (at times overshooting $40~\mathrm{{cm/s}}$ in the shallow area; Bensi et al., 2019), and more vertical shear. These factors create more instability in the current an d increase the formation of eddies, as compared to summer conditions (von Appen et al., 2016; Hattermann et al., 2016).  

The colder (less than $-0.9^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ ) and slightly less saline ( $/{\sim}34.91\$ ppt; MOSJ, 2023) NSDW fills th e deep marine environment below $1200\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth underlying the NAW (Aagaard et al., 1985; Rudels et al., 2000; Langehaug and Falck, 2012). At this depth, the WSC is slower $\left'5{-}10\ \mathrm{cm/s};$ Bensi et al., 2019) but still steering northward. Although the high-energy shallow core of WS C causes erosion of the upper slope and outer part of the shelf, the slower, deeper core moving withi n the NSDW allows for greater deposition, contributing to the growth of sediment drifts along th e seabed (Figure F3). Source water for the NSDW comes from the mixing of Greenland Sea Dee p Water and Eurasian Basin Deep Water in the Fram Strait (Bensi et al., 2019) and is modified locall y by turbulent mixing along the Barents Sea slope (Swift and Koltermann, 1988).  

The proximity of the WSC to the continental shelf of western Svalbard sets up additional interactions that modify physical properties of the water as well as nutrient availability. Cold freshwater s from the Svalbard coast and fjords that mix with the warmer, salty NAW contribute to cooling an d freshening of the WSC as it flows north (Koenig et al., 2018). Dense water formation from hea t loss to the atmosphere, sea ice formation, and related brine rejection can overflow the shelf edg e (Quadfasel et al., 1988, 1992; Schauer, 1995; Bensi et al., 2019). Some of this overflow include s sediment-rich gravity plumes (sensu Fohrmann et al., 1998), which cascades downslope, transporting terrigenous sediment, oxygen, and nutrients offshore. Conversely, WSC warm waters ca n intrude into the shelf waters and in fjords (some at a $200{-}400\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth; Nilsen et al., 2016). The shoreward propagation of Atlantic waters from the WSC occurs both from wind-drive n upwelling and from seasonal storms (Koenig et al., 2018). The addition of oceanic heat ca n increase the melt rate of ocean-terminated glaciers (especially ice shelves) and has been identifie d as a contributing mechanism leading to accelerating ice flow, thinning, and retreat (Nilsen et al., 2016, and references therein).

ESC $=$ East Spitsbergen Current, $\mathsf{Y P=}$ Yermak Plateau, $\mathsf{F S}=$ Fram Strait (Bathymetr y IBCAO v. 3; Jakobsson et al., 2012).  

Decades of oceanographic monitoring indicate that core temperatures of the WSC are rising. Fo r example, the decadal average temperatures of the WSC between 20 and $200\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth ros e from $4.4^{\circ}C$ in 1963 to $5.3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in 2021 at monitoring stations at ${\sim}79^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ (Norwegian Polar Institute, 2022). The influx of warm North Atlantic waters to the Arctic via the WSC flow through the Fra m Strait is a primary contributor to modern Arctic sea ice loss. This “Atlantification” of the Nordi c Seas and Arctic (Årthun et al., 2012; Tsubouchi et al., 2018; Tesi et al., 2021), in turn, furthers hea t transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere, as well as reduces regional albedo, resulting in disproportionate air and surface warming of the Arctic region (an “Arctic amplification”), such that th e Arctic has warmed two to four times faster than the global average since 1979 (Rantanen et al., 2022) and may be transitioning to a new climate state.  

As the WSC flows north of Svalbard, it splits into two currents (Figure F2). One branch (the Nort h Spitsbergen Current) flows northeast along the Eurasian continental margin, ultimately contributing to the counterclockwise current system that encircles the entire Arctic basin and returns to th e Nordic Sea via the EGC. The other branch (the Yermak Slope Current) flows more directly nort h at intermediate depths along the western margin of the Yermak Plateau, transporting relativel y warm North Atlantic waters into the Arctic Ocean interior.  

Additionally, branches of the WSC recirculate west within the Fram Strait (Figure F2) (Bourke e t al., 1988; Carmack et al., 2015). It is estimated that approximately half of the North Atlantic water s transported in the WSC recirculate westward between $76^{\circ}$ and $81\mathrm{{}^{\circ}N}$ (Marnela et al., 2013), feedin g the southward flowing EGC and thereby ultimately contributing to the AMOC (Hattermann et al., 2016, and references therein). However, changes in the proportion transported north to the Arcti c or west (recirculating) are influenced by seasonal climatic and hydrographic cycles (von Appen e t al., 2016), as well as longer term regional and global changes, such as the dynamics of the Nort h

Velocity profile o f WSC presents two cores: a strong shallow core of WSC transporting warm NAW $(30{-}40~\mathsf{c m/s})$ causes sediment erosio n and/or bypass in the upper continental slope and shelf, whereas a low-velocity deep core $(\sim\!1500\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth; 5–1 0 $\mathsf{c m}/\mathsf{s},$ ) transporting NSDW promotes deposition with growth of the Isfjorden drift.

Atlantic Oscillation (Weijer et al., 2022), weakening of the Atlantic subpolar gyre associated wit h freshening of waters south of Greenland (Tesi et al., 2021), and anthropogenic global warming. Thus, the WSC is part of a complex oceanographic system that influences and is influenced b y atmospheric, sea ice, and shelf water interactions; its connections to regional gyres; and globa l ocean thermohaline circulation. Therefore, it is important to understand the behavior of the WS C under a range of climate states, transitions, and timescales.  

# 2.2. Geologic setting  

The timing and modality of the opening of the Fram Strait are still largely debated (e.g., Thiede an d Myhre, 1996; Jokat et al., 2008; Knies and Gaina, 2008; Backman and Moran, 2009; Poirier an d Hillaire-Marcel, 2011; Ehlers and Jokat, 2013). Strike-slip movement and oblique ultraslo w spreading in this region linked the active ocean ridge systems in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea (t o the south) and the Arctic Eurasian Basin (to the north) (Gruetzer et al., 2022). The continenta l areas were separated by the early Miocene, but subsidence histories of different parts of the strai t are poorly known. However, much evidence indicates a deep ocean circulation was establishe d between the Norwegian-Greenland Sea and the Arctic Ocean since about 6 Ma, during the Lat e Miocene (Jakobsson et al., 2007; Mattingsdal et al., 2014; Knies et al., 2014; Stärz et al., 2017).  

The bathymetry of the eastern Fram Strait is related to its tectonic history as well as its depositional history. Eiken and Hinz (1993) describe several bathymetric regions in this area, three o f which are most relevant to the Expedition 403 sites (Figure F1):  

• The region north of the Molloy Transform Fault (MTF) between the active spreading Molloy Ridge and the western Svalbard continental slope. The northernmost Expedition 403 Sites U1618 and U1619 are in this region at the east and west ends of an elongate sediment drift deposit that overlies relatively young oceanic crust $\left(<19\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ .   
• The region south of the MTF between the Hovgaard Ridge and the northernmost extension of the Knipovich Ridge. The Hovgaard Ridge is an aseismic (i.e., nonspreading) ridge of uncertain origin (Myhre et al., 1982; Engen et al., 2008; Gruetzer et al., 2022). Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 151 Site 908 is located on that ridge, and Site 909 is in the Molloy Basin just north of it. Expedition 403 Site U1620 is located on a sediment drift deposit that extends off the western flank of the Knipovich Ridge and overlies very young $\left(<10\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ oceanic crust.   
• The region between the active spreading Knipovich Ridge and the western Svalbard continental slope. ODP Site 986 (Leg 162) and the southernmost Expedition 403 sites are in this region. The Expedition 403 Sites U1621–U1624 are situated on plastered sediment drifts deposited along the continental slope.  

The depositional history along the eastern Fram Strait is influenced by changes in strength of th e WSC, as well as the onshore geology, including postbreakup regional tectonic uplift, and the dynamics of the paleo-Svalbard–Barents Sea Ice Sheet (SBSIS) complex. The archipelago of Svalbar d is the northwest emergent part of the Barents Sea shelf. Western Svalbard is a mountainous terrai n of faulted and folded Devonian to Paleogene sedimentary units partially overlying older crystallin e basement rocks. Additionally, Quaternary volcanic units occur in the northwest. Western Svalbard experienced multiple episodes of uplift and erosion that occurred both pre- and postriftin g (Lasabuda et al., 2021). Uplift events are associated with a range of tectonic (e.g., rift flank uplift, crustal flexure, and transpressive movement), mantle, and glacio-isostatic processes (Minakov, 2018; Lasabuda et al., 2021). The creation of elevated topography may have been one of the necessary preconditions for glaciation at the Miocene–Pliocene transition and for the growth of ic e sheets in Svalbard and across the broader Barents Sea shelf in the late Pliocene and Pleistocen e (Knies et al., 2014; Gruetzner et al., 2022).  

The Barents Sea covers one of Earth’s most extensive continental shelves. It is characterized by  a complex morphology of shallow banks $^{7}50{-}100\ \mathrm{m}$ water depth) and deep troughs $?200{-}400\ \mathrm{m}$ water depth) cutting across the shelf (Nilsen et al., 2016), and it was shaped by multiple advancements and retreats of the paleo-SBSIS in the Pliocene–Pleistocene (Alexandropoulou et al., 2021). Similar to the Antarctic margins, the ice sheet basal ablation and ice mass weight caused deepening of the substrate and differential isostatic subsidence generating retrograde profiles along th e main glacial troughs (e.g., Bjørnøyrenna, Storfjorden Trough). In the Pleistocene, the paleo-SBSI S complex became marine based (Laberg et al., 2010; Alexandropoulou et al., 2021; Zieba et al., 2017), and this change potentially subjected the paleo-SBSIS to marine ice sheet instabilities unde r warm oceanic conditions like in the modern WAIS, as outlined by Petrini et al. (2018, 2020). T o these extents, the paleomarine-based SBSIS can be considered the best analog to the moder n marine-based WAIS, for which the loss of stability is a major concern for future global sea leve l projections in response to the present global warming. The record of the paleo-SBSIS is more easily accessible compared to Antarctica, making it an ideal laboratory to further investigate th e effects of ice-atmosphere-ocean interactions under fast warm climatic oscillations, as well as th e Late Miocene and Pliocene–Quaternary transitions that remain poorly constrained.  

Recent bathymetric analysis of submarine glacial landforms in the Norwegian Sea provides furthe r evidence that Nordic paleo–ice sheet records can inform scientific understanding about moder n WAIS processes and future risks. Batchelor et al. (2023) identified submarine grounding line s along the mid-Norwegian shelf that indicate rapid $^{7}55\mathrm{-}610~\mathrm{m/day},$ ) buoyancy-driven ice shee t retreat during the late Pleistocene deglaciation. These values exceed previously reported rates o f glacial retreat from modern (satellite) and paleo (marine-geologic) records and suggest the possibility for rapid retreat of currently vulnerable glaciers, including those of the WAIS.  

# 2.3. Depositional setting and processes  

The sedimentary records that are the focus of Expedition 403 are contained within the contourit e drifts that were built and shaped by the WSC flowing along the western margin of Svalbard int o the Arctic Ocean (Figures F3, F4). Contourite drifts are mounded depocenters generated by persistent (over My) bottom currents that transport and deposit sediments delivered to the depositional system through other processes such as marine biological activity, downslope movin g turbidity currents, and glaciogenic processes. They cover large areas of the European North Atlantic margin, including the Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, and western Svalbard along the eastern sid e of the Fram Strait (Laberg et al., 2005). Their development has been related to tectonically influenced intensification of the paleocirculation system transporting warm NAW to the North Atlantic and Nordic Seas. These influences include the closing of the Central American Seaway in th e Pliocene (Coates and Obando, 1996; O’Dea et al., 2016), the subsidence of the Greenland-Scotlan d Ridge during the middle Miocene (Bohrmann et al., 1990; Wright, 1998), and the opening of th e Fram Strait sometime between the late Eocene and late Miocene (20 and 5 Ma) (e.g., Jakobsson e t al., 2007; Jokat et al., 2008; Knies and Gaina, 2008; Zachos et al., 2008; Geissler et al., 2011; Thompson et al., 2012; Hegewald and Jokat, 2013; Stärz et al., 2017; Stevenson et al., 2015; Tripati an d Darby, 2018).  

During times of glacial ice expansion and retreat, terrigenous sediment has been delivered to th e western Svalbard continental slope through two main glaciogenic processes (Figure F4): (1) mas s transport deposition, indicating shelf edge glaciations, forming several tens of meters thick deposits of highly consolidated glaciogenic diamicton (upper slope) and normally consolidated glaciogenic debris flows (middle and low slope) (Solheim et al., 1996; Vorren and Laberg, 1997; Butt e t al., 2000; Vanneste et al., 2007), and (2) sediment-laden meltwater plumes associated with ice shee t melting and retreat during glacial terminations and responsible for the deposition of plumite s (sensu Hesse et al., 1997), which have an aerial distribution confined within a few tens of kilometers from the source area (Lucchi et al., 2002, 2013; Shackleton et al., 2020). The thickness o f plumites can vary from a few centimeters to several meters in the area proximal to the efflux point. Ice-rafted debris (IRD) can be associated with meltwater deposition (ice sheet decay) and with  a highly dynamic growing ice sheet (high calving rates). All these sediment types provide direc t information on the ice sheet dynamics that is complementary to the paleoceanographic information and contribute to the reconstruction of the climate history of the area.  

During warm interglacials, the sedimentation is dominated by bottom currents (Figure F4), generating condensed sequences in the upper slope where the current speed is higher and expande d sequences in the lower slope where drifts of fine-grained and strongly bioturbated sediment s build. Presently, and possibly during past interglacials, sediment input from nearshore settings i s delivered by downslope cascading of brine-enriched shelf water (BSW), which forms during winter through persistent freezing and brine rejection (Quadfasel et al., 1988; Schauer, 1995; Skogset h et al., 2005). Dense BSW, moving across the shelf, resuspends seafloor sediments that are transported to the shelf break and delivered to the deeper environments entering the NSDW and transported northward or deposited in sediment drifts. This process is thought to be the presen t principal mechanism responsible for initiation of slope convection in the Arctic Ocean contributing significantly to the overall heat and salt balance of the deep Arctic Ocean basins and thus providing ventilation to the deeper environments (Fer et al., 2003; Schauer et al., 2004).  

Given these sediment input processes, contourites provide records of marine biogenic an d terrestrial/cryospheric variability through time, as well as changes in current intensity. Contourit e drifts on the slope close to the outlet troughs of marine ice sheets can contain detailed informatio n on ice sheet dynamics through time. Additionally, contourite drifts that develop on the slop e between trough mouth fan (TMF) systems can be especially useful for paleoceanographic reconstructions, as these interfan-slope depocenters are mainly under the influence of along-slope currents and hemipelagic deposition but are less directly in the path of debris flows. These setting s are characterized by relatively high and continuous accumulation rates. Additionally, because o f the continuous supply of oxygen and nutrients through bottom currents, these areas are suitabl e environments to support the benthic biological community. The high sedimentation rates als o result in fast burial of the biological remains (Laberg and Vorren, 2004; Knutz, 2008; Rørvik et al., 2010; Rebesco et al., 2014a). The depositional sequences of the contourite drifts that develope d along the western margin of Svalbard and eastern side of the Fram Strait, therefore, preserved  a high-resolution, mostly continuous sedimentary record since the Late Miocene (Eiken and Hinz, 1993; Howe et al., 2008; Rebesco et al., 2013; Waghorn et al., 2018), with regionally consistent paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic records at least since 1.6–1.3 Ma (Butt et al., 2000; Rebesco et al., 2014b).

# 2.4. Paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic context  

The establishment of the modern NAW circulation has been indicated as one of the main forcin g mechanisms for the late Pliocene–Pleistocene onset of the Northern Hemisphere glaciatio n (NHG) (Haug et al., 2005; Schmidt, 2007; Lunt et al., 2008), in contrast to the warming effects o f the mid-late Pliocene high concentration of atmospheric $C O_{2}$ . The NAW flux and propertie s (salinity and temperature) exerted a strong control on the extent and dynamics of circum-Arcti c and circum-North Atlantic ice sheets, sea ice formation and distribution, modulating brine production, deep water mass characteristics, and hence climate.  

Expedition 403 was designed to target the continuous and expanded $(>\!300\ m/\mathrm{Ma})$ paleoceanographic records preserved in the contourite drifts developed on the western margin of Svalbar d and eastern side of the Fram Strait (Bellsund and Isfjorden drifts and Svyatogor and Vestnes a Ridges; Figure F1) since the onset of the NAW circulation in the northern Atlantic and Arcti c Ocean (Howe et al., 2008; Rebesco et al., 2013; Waghorn et al., 2018). The regional record of th e following key paleoclimatic transitions and events are expected to be present in the Expeditio n 403 cored sedimentary sequence.  

# 2.4.1. Late Miocene–Early Pliocene transition  

The Late Miocene–Early Pliocene transition $^{7-3.6\mathrm{\,Ma}}$ ; Holbourn et al., 2018) marked the transition between the Late Miocene cooling (LMC; $7{-}5.5\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , the end of a period of gradual temperature decrease initiated at around 13 My after the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum $(17{-}14.8\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ), and the Early Pliocene $^{\left(5.5-3.6\mathrm{\;Ma}\right)}$ ), characterized by temperatures warmer than today. The LM C was characterized by a substantial drop in atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ${\sqrt{\le}}300\,\mathrm{\,ppm}_{\mathrm{}}$ ; Zhang et al., 2013; Mejí a et al., 2017). Proxy-based global sea surface temperature reconstructions showed that a sustaine d cooling occurred synchronously in both hemispheres, culminating with ocean surface temperatures dipping to near-modern values and a steepening of the pole-to-equator gradient betwee n about 7 and $5.4\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Herbert et al., 2016). The period of maximum cooling coincides with evidenc e for transient glaciations in southern Greenland (Wolf and Thiede, 1991; Jansen and Sjøholm, 1991; Larsen et al., 1994; Wolf-Welling et al., 1995; Bierman et al., 2016; St. John and Krissek, 2002), th e Arctic (St. John, 2008), and southern Alaska (Krissek et al., 1995). The Early Pliocene period i s instead characterized by an increase in atmospheric ${\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ $({>}400~\mathrm{ppm};$ Seki et al., 2010), a globa l mean temperature $2^{\circ}{-}3^{\circ}C$ higher relative to present with a culminating warmth at around $4.4\,M{\bf a}$ (Fedorov et al., 2013), and a weaker meridional temperature gradient compared to present (Ford e t al., 2015). Episodic seasonal Arctic sea ice was found through the Late Miocene (Stein et al., 2016 ) and was also recorded during the Early Pliocene on the Yermak Plateau at ${\sim}4.5$ Ma with a substantial expansion observed from ${\sim}4\mathrm{~Ma}$ (Clotten et al., 2019). A hypothesis relates this expansion t o an increased northward transport of heat and moisture to the North Atlantic, likely leading to  a fresher Arctic Ocean favoring sea ice formation (Clotten et al., 2019). The paucity of field information on this transition hampered the constraint of the possible forcing mechanisms.  

# 2.4.2. Mid-Pliocene warm period  

Many scientists look at the mid-Pliocene warm period $\mathrm{(mPWP;3.3{-}3.0\ M a)}$ as the best analog t o modern climatic conditions, and studying it can give important information to predict future scenarios. The Pliocene was characterized by a progressive rise of atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ $(>450\ \mathrm{ppm})$ an d temperatures, with values compatible with modern ones at about $4\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . This trend was suddenl y interrupted at the beginning of the mPWP by a short cold period: the M2 glaciation (3.312–3.26 4 Ma) (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005), which is of particular interest because of its short duration $(50\,\mathrm{ky}$ only) compared to the Pleistocene glaciations, its global character ( $\mathrm{20{-}60~m}$ of global sea leve l drop), and its sharp termination (De Schepper et al., 2014) with a particularly intense interglacia l (Warm Isotopic Stage KM5c) reaching temperature comparable to present day in a similar-topresent orbital context (Haywood et al., 2016). It is not yet understood what triggered the M 2 glaciation (e.g., Tan et al., 2017) and what caused the following KM5c warm conditions; however, such climatic events appear approximately coeval with transitory tectonic shallowing and deepening of the Central American Seaway preceding its final close (Schmidt, 2007).  

The final closure of the Central American Seaway with the formation of the Panama Isthmus a t ${\sim}2.8\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Coates and Obando, 1996; Burton et al., 1997; O’Dea et al., 2016) is postulated for th e onset of the modern NAW configuration, and intensification of NHG occurred since ${\sim}2.7~\mathrm{Ma}$ . This also marks the first large-scale glaciation of western Svalbard $({\sim}2.7\,\mathrm{Ma})$ prograding onto th e southernmost Yermak Plateau (Mattingsdal et al., 2014). Uncertainties remain about the timing o f the Central American Seaway closure (Montes et al., 2015; Bacon et al., 2015), and numerical studies estimated that the heat provided by the strengthening of the NAW hindered hemispheric glaciations (e.g., Haug et al., 2005; Schmidt, 2007; Lunt et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2017), leaving th e identification of possible forcing mechanisms still unsolved.  

# 2.4.3. Onset of shelf edge glaciations  

Although based on poor age control, the paleo-SBSIS, mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT), MidBrunhes event (MBE), and millennial-scale oscillations are interpreted to have reached the shel f break at different ages along the western Barents Sea/Svalbard margin. According to Alexandropoulou et al. (2021), an early, transient phase of shelf edge glaciation occurred soon after 2.5 8 Ma and a second phase occurred between 1.95 and $1.78\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Widespread shelf edge glaciatio n started at only ${\sim}1.5\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , reaching the shelf edge at the mouth of Bjørnøyrenna (Andreassen et al., 2007) and subsequently $({\sim}1.2\,M\mathrm{a})$ on the Storfjorden/southern Spitsbergen margin (Rebesco et al., 2014b). The reasons for such diachronic onset, prograding from south to north under similar forcing mechanisms (Forsberg et al., 1999; Butt et al., 2000; Knies et al., 2009; Rebesco et al., 2014b), i s still unclear.  

There is a general lack of consensus on the forcing mechanisms to explain the MPT $(1.2–0.7\ \mathrm{Ma};$ Pisias and Moore, 1981), also known in the literature as the 100,000-year problem (Shackleton, 2000; Raymo and Nisancioglu, 2003; Clark et al., 2006; Rial et al., 2013; Nyman and Ditlevsen, 2019). Recent studies indicated the interplay between atmospheric $C O_{2}$ concentration, orbita l forcing, ocean circulation, and ice sheet dynamics to explain the shifts in glacial cyclicity from ${\sim}41$ to $100\ \mathrm{ka}$ during the Mid-Pleistocene (Holbourn et al., 2013; Levy et al., 2019), but robust constraints and definition of the main forcing mechanism are still missing.  

The causes of the MBE $(\sim\!400\,\mathrm{ka})$ , which marked the transition from cooler to warmer interglacial s (Tzedakis et al., 2009; Cronin et al., 2017) characterized by larger amplitude stable oxygen isotop e and ${\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ cycles, with $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ overshooting $300~\mathrm{ppm}$ (Tzedakis et al., 2009), and marked sea leve l highstands sometimes above present-day global mean sea level (e.g., Dutton et al., 2015), remai n largely unclear.  

The millennial-scale isotopic oscillations that occurred during the last $100\,\mathrm{ky}$ are the most simila r past events to forecast future rapid climatic transition due to ice sheets melting. Those events wer e observed in ice core and sediment records, and they are referred to as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O ) oscillations (warming abrupt event; Dansgaard et al., 1993) and Heinrich events (cooling event s during cold stadials). In particular, 25 D-O oscillations (each from around 2000 y to a few centurie s in length) have been identified in the North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) ice core recor d over the last $125\,\mathrm{ky}$ (NGRIP Members, 2004), and at least six Heinrich events (marked IRD layers ) have been found in the North Atlantic sediment records (Bond et al., 1992), likely caused by massive iceberg discharge due to Laurentide ice sheet instabilities (Broecker et al., 1992). D-O an d Heinrich events are not unrelated, and their alternation could be caused by the bipolar seesa w (Stocker and Johnsen, 2003), in other words, oceanic heat and salt transfer from one hemispher e to another to balance freshwater incomes. This concept is also supported by the numerical simulations conducted by Golledge et al. (2019) and Turney et al. (2020), which clearly indicate th e close tie existing between the antipode polar areas.  

# 3. Scientific objectives  

# 3.1. Scientific goal, objectives, and hypotheses  

Expedition 403 was primarily a paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic expedition. The overarchin g scientific goal was to recover a sedimentary record that could be used to reconstruct the WSC (i.e., NAW influx) variability; its influence on climate changes, particularly during key climate transitions (late Miocene–Pliocene transition, late Pliocene–Pleistocene Transition, MPT, Mid-Brunhe s  

Transition, and suborbital Heinrich-like events); and its impact on the Arctic glaciations, ic e shelves development and stability, and sea ice distribution.  

The primary objectives to meet the overarching paleoceanographic/paleoclimatic goal included:  

1. The development of a high-resolution, Late Miocene–Quaternary chronostratigraphic record based on a suite of independent chronostratigraphic methods to temporally constrain paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic events and the paleo-SBSIS dynamics.   
2. The generation of multiproxy data sets to better constrain the potential concurrent forcing mechanisms responsible for Late Miocene to Quaternary climatic transitions.   
3. The identification of orbital, suborbital, millennial-scale climate variations such as Heinrich events and possible associated prominent meltwater events (i.e., pulses of water discharge from ice sheet margins).   
4. The evaluation of the impact of past prominent sediment-laden meltwater events on the paleoceanography, paleoenvironment, and paleoclimate.   
5. The reconstruction of the paleo-SBSIS dynamic history in relation to changes in the WSC pathways and characteristics as mechanisms inducing ice sheet instability and fast retreat.  

In meeting these primary objectives with good sediment recovery, the following hypotheses ar e testable.  

Hypothesis 1: the onset of the WSC, transporting NAW, was the main forcing mechanism for th e intensification of NHG and was a main forcing mechanism for climatic variability in the Norther n Hemisphere through the supply of heat and salt modulating the growth and decay of the Arctic ic e sheets and sea ice.  

The establishment of the modern NAW has been indicated as one of the main forcing mechanism s for the intensification of NHG (e.g., Haug et al., 2005; Schmidt, 2007; Lunt et al., 2008). Nort h Atlantic water flux and properties (salinity and temperature) control the extent and dynamics o f circum-Arctic and circum-North Atlantic ice sheets, sea ice formation and distribution modulating brine production, deepwater mass characteristics, and hence, climate. How the ocean syste m worked during past warmer intervals of high insulation and/or high atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content i s still unknown and debated. Another critical issue is the timing and evolution of the transitions int o such warm intervals as gradual transition or punctuated by tipping points (e.g., Lenton et al., 2019).  

Hypothesis 2: Quaternary variations in sea ice cover in the central Arctic Ocean were influence d by changes in the properties of the WSC, which in turn were affected by hemispheric or globa l climate shifts.  

Only a few studies exist that directly target the role of sea ice during Pleistocene glacial–interglacia l cycles. Gildor and Tziperman (2001) used a simple box model of the ocean–atmosphere–sea ice– land ice climate system to propose the so-called sea ice climate switch to explain Pleistocene transitions from ice sheet advance into ice sheet retreat phases. The mechanism is based on the impac t of sea ice on both the evaporation from high-latitude ocean areas and atmospheric moisture transport, which are pivotal for the continental ice sheet dynamics.  

Massive discharge of Arctic sea ice through the Fram Strait during the Younger Dryas is increasingly suggested to have caused the weakening of the AMOC, resulting in a significant cooling a t the end of the last deglaciation, and highlights the importance of nonterrestrial freshwater source s (as opposed to glacial meltwater) for abrupt climate shifts (e.g., Bradley and England, 2008; Condron et al., 2020; Müller and Stein, 2014; Not and Hillaire-Marcel, 2012). Extended sea ice cover i n the subpolar North Atlantic since 1 Ma has further been linked to lower primary productivity an d elevated input of IRD during glacials (Stein and Fahl, 2013), but highly resolved records have bee n missing to better constrain the role of sea ice during climate transitions.  

Hypothesis 3: during the Quaternary, the variations of WSC pathway and characteristics triggered past SBSIS instabilities.  

Reconstructions of the Barents Sea paleobathymetry suggest an evolution similar to that of Wes t Antarctica. The Barents Sea was much shallower and partly emerged until the Late Pliocene (But t et al., 2002; Laberg et al., 2012; Zieba et al., 2017) and gradually deepened due to substrate erosio n during past glaciations until most of the paleo-SBSIS became marine based with alternation o f glaciations (Laberg et al., 2010). In analogy with West Antarctica during the Miocene (Colleoni e t al., 2018), the paleo-SBSIS could have become more vulnerable to WSC intrusion on the continental shallow shelf.  

We hypothesized that at some point in the Pleistocene, the paleo-SBSIS became subject to mor e frequent instabilities of its grounding line, with rapid inland retreat and large IRD delivery an d freshwater discharges along the Svalbard margin during warm intervals (e.g., interglacials, D- O events, and meltwater pulses). Those instabilities, combined with those of the Laurentide Ic e Sheet, could have paced and shaped the glacial–interglacial cycles and their evolution throughou t the Pleistocene (e.g., Clark et al., 1999).  

In addition to the primary paleoceanographic/paleoclimatic objectives, two secondary objective s have tectonic and microbiological foci:  

1. Constraining the spatial location of the Miocene–Pliocene transition $({\sim}5.3\,\mathrm{Ma})$ north and south of the MTF, at the Vestnesa Ridge and the Svyatogor Ridge, respectively, thus reducing the existing uncertainties about the spreading rate of the Molloy and north Knipovich Ridges inferred from magnetic anomalies Chron 2A $\left(2.8\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ and Chron 5 $\left(9.8\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ (e.g., Engen et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2015). In addition, geomechanical and petrophysical data from these key regions will help constrain spatial variations in the effect of glacial and tectonic stresses on subseabed sediment deformation and carbon transport associated with paleoclimatic changes. 2. Investigating the influence of the WSC variability, ice coverage, and climate on the microbial populations through time and to what extent these interactions still affect contemporary geochemical fluxes.  

In support of these secondary objectives, the following hypotheses may be testable:  

• Hypothesis 4: glacial rebound has imposed significant forcing to the already complex tectonic stress field since the opening of the Fram Strait, enhancing sediment fracturing, fault reactivation, and associated carbon transport during key glacial–interglacial transitions.   
• Hypothesis 5: differences in organic carbon input between glacial versus interglacial periods will affect microbial community abundance, diversity, and activity.   
• Hypothesis 6: microbial communities will have changed in response to freshwater input during glacial termination events.  

It is anticipated that glacial deposits will be enriched in microbial groups specialized in degradin g organic matter of terrestrial origin and reflect in a higher frequency in metabolic pathways facilitating the degradation of more recalcitrant carbon, as observed in the equatorial Atlantic an d Baltic Sea (Freitas et al., 2020).  

The sedimentary deep biosphere extends thousands of meters below the surface and hosts a vas t and ecologically significant microbial population that continues to be active even after millions o f years of burial (Røy et al., 2012; Orsi, 2018; Zhao et al., 2019; Morono et al., 2020). Through thei r activity, they regulate the fluxes of dissolved geochemical species in and out of the seafloor an d exert primary control on the long-term fate of sequestered organic carbon (Hoehler and Jørgensen, 2013). To this end, the microbial activity and population size are tightly coupled to th e input of organic carbon to the seafloor (Kallmeyer et al., 2012). This in turn is a function of severa l parameters where key variables, such as primary productivity, are strongly influenced by ocea n currents and sea ice coverage. However, our understanding to what extent past ocean circulatio n patterns and sea ice cover is preserved in the contemporary sedimentary microbial population i n the form of abundances, diversity, and activity and if this continues to influence modern geochemical fluxes is still unclear and the investigation is limited by the absence of suitable records especially for the older depositional units (Orsi et al., 2017).  

The expedition drill sites are located in an area where profound changes in Earth’s climate histor y are stored in the sedimentary record. Sampling of these relevant sedimentary sequences coupl e the effect of changing climate, including changes in sea ice cover, to potential variability in microbial populations. The possibility to sample identical climatic periods at different geographica l locations along the main path of the WSC provides an exceptional opportunity to study whethe r specific oceanographic/climatic periods translate into specific microbial communities or regiona l variables are more important. By extension, such information allows more precise prediction o f potential future scenarios caused by changing climate.  

# 3.2. Relationships to the 2013–2023 IODP Science Plan and the 2050 Science Framework  

Expedition 403 operated under the guidance of the 2013–2023 IODP Science Plan (Bickle et al., 2011). Specifically, the expedition science addresses challenges (i.e., program-wide guiding questions) posed by three IODP Science Plan research themes:  

• Climate and Ocean Change, Challenges 1 and 2: How does Earth’s climate system respond to elevated levels of atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ? How do ice sheets and sea level respond to a warming climate?   
• Biosphere Frontiers, Challenge 7: How sensitive are ecosystems and biodiversity to environmental change?   
• Earth in Motion, Challenge 13: What properties and processes govern the flow and storage of carbon in the subseafloor?  

The science objectives of Expedition 403 are also convergent with several areas of scientific inquiry described in the 2050 Science Framework (Koppers and Coggon, 2020). In particular, th e Expedition 403 primary objective directly supports 2050 Science Framework Strategic Objective  3 (Earth’s Climate System) to examine variations in ice sheets, ocean and atmospheric dynamics, and sea level. Understanding the interconnections among the ocean, atmosphere, cryosphere, an d marine biosphere in the eastern Fram Strait is an overarching Expedition 403 goal. In addition, th e Expedition 403 secondary objectives focus on tectonic and deep biosphere scientific inquiries. These foci directly support 2050 Science Framework Strategic Objective 2 (The Oceanic Life Cycle of Tectonic Plates), which aims to investigate the genesis, aging, motion, and destruction o f oceanic lithosphere, and 2050 Science Framework Strategic Objective 1 (Habitability and Life o n Earth), which aims to define the conditions for and the role of life in the marine realm. Becaus e Expedition 403 strived to obtain high-resolution paleoarchive records of Late Miocene to Pleistocene climate system events and transitions (including rapid warming events and paleo–ice shee t destabilizations), 2050 Science Framework Objective 5 (Tipping Points in Earth’s History), whic h aims to use Earth’s geologic past to illuminate future environmental change, is also of direct relevance. Finally, the scientific outcomes of Expedition 403 are expected to contribute data that ca n enable more robust modeling of direct and indirect cause and effect relationships in the Eart h system under a range of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ conditions, both similar to today and at levels projected for the nea r future. Therefore, the expedition science also contributes to 2050 Science Framework Flagshi p Initiative 1 (Ground Truthing Future Climate Change).  

# 3.3. Connection to other expeditions  

Expedition 403 builds upon the success of ODP Legs 151 and 162 and Integrated Ocean Drillin g Program Expedition 302 in the Fram Strait and Arctic Ocean. The primary objectives of ODP Leg s 151 and 162 were reconstructing the paleoceanography of the Fram Strait and glacial evolution i n the circum-Nordic Seas during the Neogene (Jansen and Raymo, 1996; Thiede and Myhre, 1996). Expedition 302 (Arctic Coring Expedition [ACEX]) focused on the long-term Cenozoic paleoenvironmental history of the central Arctic Ocean (Backman and Moran, 2009). These previous expeditions mainly focused on recovery of condensed sequences, having the aim to reach the olde r units to reconstruct the dynamic history of the Arctic and Subarctic oceans. In contrast, Expedition 403 specifically focused on recovery of expanded sequences to increase the resolution o f paleoclimatic reconstruction and complex feedback among the atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere. The objectives of Expedition 403 are also complementary to IODP Expedition 400 (NW Greenland Glaciated Margin; Knutz et al., 2024) by working to understand pan-Arctic ice sheet/ocea n dynamics and to IODP Expedition 401 (Mediterranean–Atlantic Gateway Exchange; Flecker et al., 2024) by providing a wider picture of the evolution of North Atlantic ocean circulation, includin g heat and salt exchange.  

Given that the Arctic is so sensitive to climate and ocean change now and in the geologic past, there is an ongoing need for expanded subseafloor sampling at targeted pan-Arctic locations. Th e paleoperspectives that only scientific ocean drilling can provide are essential for informing predictive models of future climate and ocean change. Although the landscape of scientific ocean drillin g is changing with the ending of IODP, the need to obtain high-resolution and long-time series subseafloor samples and data sets remains. Prioritization of pan-Arctic subseafloor sampling is necessary to provide a more complete reconstruction of pan-Arctic paleocirculation, related glacial an d sea ice histories, and the characterizations of paleoanalog times of rapid change, as well as period s of globally warm climate states.  

# 4. Site summaries  

In this report, unless otherwise stated, subseafloor depths are reported as meters below seafloo r (mbsf). The mbsf scale is equivalent to meters core depth below seafloor, Method A (CSF-A), which is the depth scale that will be used in the expedition site chapters. In total, seven site s (U1618–U1624) were drilled during Expedition 403 (Table T1; Figure F5). Summaries of key shipboard results are described below.  

# 4.1. Site U1618  

# 4.1.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1618 is located in the Fram Strait near the western continental margin of Svalbard a t $78^{\circ}56.91^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $7^{\circ}28.39^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a $1196\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Table T1; Figure F5). Site U1618 is the first of tw o sites drilled on the Vestnesa Ridge, a prominent bathymetric feature north of and nearly parallel t o the MTF. The evolution of the Vestnesa Ridge is linked to the tectonic, sedimentary, and climati c history of the region, making it a focal point for multidisciplinary scientific research. The $100\;\mathrm{km}$ long ridge is a sediment drift generated by persistent bottom currents associated with the WS C (Eiken and Hinz, 1993) that developed over oceanic crust since the Fram Strait opening $({\sim}19\,\mathrm{My})$ (Engen et al., 2008). It has been hypothesized that the main axis of the Vestnesa Ridge ha s migrated orientation from north–south to east–west over time due to the westward motion of th e plate north of the MTF (Johnson et al., 2015), forcing a lateral displacement of the main path of th e WSC to follow the bathymetric contour around the ridge.

Figure F5. Drilling operations, Expedition 403. Sites and holes are organized (left to right) in order of operation, except fo r Holes U1623D–U1623G, which were drilled upon return to the site following operations at Site U1624.  

Although the chronology of the Vestnesa Ridge sediment record deposited since the last glacial i s well established (e.g., Rasmussen and Nielsen, 2024, and references therein) and regionally correlatable (Lucchi et al., 2023), the chronology prior to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 has been limited to extrapolations made through seismic correlations to previously drilled sites on the Yerma k Plateau (ODP Site 912) and the Molloy Basin (south of the MTF; ODP Site 909) (Eiken and Hinz, 1993; Knies et al., 2014; Mattingsdal et al., 2014; Alexandropoulou et al., 2021).  

During the Pliocene–Pleistocene, marine sedimentation in this region was heavily influenced b y the intensification of NHG, ice sheet growth and decay over Svalbard and the Barents Sea, an d variations in Arctic sea ice extent (Jakobsson et al., 2014). Shallow sediment records from pisto n and gravity cores along the western Svalbard continental margin document depositional facie s representing a range of glaciogenic processes since MIS 3. These include ice rafting events, downslope sediment mass transport, and subglacial meltwater plumes, which alternated with bioturbated, bottom current–driven sediments that settled during warmer periods (e.g., Rasmusse n et al., 2007; Jessen et al., 2010; Lucchi et al., 2013, 2015; Caricchi et al., 2019). Concurrent stratigraphic intervals from the Vestnesa Ridge are consistent with these depositional patterns (Schneider et al., 2018; Sztybor and Rasmussen, 2017a; Plaza-Faverola et al., 2023; Rasmussen an d Nielsen, 2024); therefore, we anticipated that this depositional framework could be applied to  a much longer stratigraphic sequence drilled at Site U1618.

The geologic setting of the Vestnesa Ridge is additionally influenced by the presence of ga s hydrates and associated fluid migration, which both complicates the paleoclimatic sedimentar y record and creates additional research opportunities. The east Vestnesa Ridge is characterized b y large pockmarks connected to chimneys with ongoing seepage of methane and other hydrocarbons along its narrow crest $\cdot\mathord{\sim}3\ \mathrm{km}$ wide) (Plaza-Faverola et al., 2015; Sztybor and Rasmussen, 2017b; Schneider et al., 2018). Seismic surveys also reveal a regional gas hydrate–related botto m simulating reflector (BSR) and thus the presence of gas hydrate and free gas at depth. Previou s studies indicate that the hydrate stability zone is several hundred meters thick and can extend t o the seafloor (Himmler et al., 2019; Pape et al., 2020; Plaza-Faverola et al., 2023; Rasmussen an d Nielsen, 2024).  

The drilling location for Site U1618 (proposed Site VRE-03A; Lucchi et al., 2023) was chosen fo r its proximity to the continental margin and outer reaches of the northwestern area of the paleoSBSIS, making this site well suited to reconstruct the ice sheet dynamics. Seismic Reflectors R1– R8 were drilling targets, with a total depth target of 738 mbsf. For safety, and to maximize recover y toward the primary paleoclimatic science objectives, Site U1618 was positioned away from th e regional BSR.  

At Site U1618, the main initial objective was to recover a complete stratigraphy from Seismi c Reflector R8 ${\sim}5.8\,\mathrm{Ma})$ to present. Such recovery would support the following research goals:  

• Reconstruction of a high-resolution sediment stratigraphy since the Late Miocene–Early Pliocene transition;   
• Study of ocean-cryosphere interactions and forcing mechanisms on the paleo-SBSIS dynamics;   
• Definition of the effect of glacial and tectonic stresses on subseafloor sediment deformation and carbon transport; and   
• Investigation of the influence of the WSC variability, ice coverage, and climate on the microbial populations through time and to what extent this is still affecting contemporary geochemical fluxes.  

Additionally, this location offers the opportunity to explore possible relationships (including feedbacks and tipping points) among paleo–ice sheets, gas hydrate stability, and tectonic stress.  

# 4.1.2. Operations  

We arrived at Site U1618 on 14 June 2024 after transiting from Amsterdam (The Netherlands). I n total, we spent 9 days on site, drilled three holes along Seismic Line CAGE20-5-HH-02-2D (Figur e F6), and logged one hole (Figure F5; Table T1). Hole U1618A was located $3.8\,\mathrm{km}$ from a gas chimney and $1.1\,\mathrm{km}$ from a fault, which may be a conduit for fluid migration (Figure F6). Holes U1618 B and U1618C were located farther from these features, 50 and $25\textrm{m}$ northeast of Hole U1618A, respectively. All three holes had intervals in which the sediments significantly expanded due to th e presence of gas, resulting in recoveries often exceeding $100\%$ . Additional borehole temperatur e measurements were made at Site U1618 to determine the geothermal gradient, which was necessary data for hydrocarbon safety monitoring. Each hole had to be terminated prematurely fo r anomalous methane/ethane $\left({C_{1}}/{C_{2}}\right)$ ratios (Figure F7) and/or for increased presence of highe r (e.g., $C_{5},\,C_{6})$ hydrocarbons. Coring reached a maximum depth of 414.3 mbsf, several hundre d meters shy of our target depth. Nevertheless, a combined cored interval of $1102.3\;\mathrm{m}$ resulted in  a recovered length of $1078.45\;\mathrm{m}$ . Because formation characteristics (e.g., gas content and sedimen t stiffness) changed at each hole, deployment of the advanced piston corer (APC) system shifted t o the half-length APC (HLAPC) system and then to the extended core barrel (XCB) drilling system, at different downhole depths. At Site U1618, there were 152 cores in total: 40 APC $(26.3\%)$ , 1 7 HLAPC $(11.2\%)$ , and 95 XCB $(62.5\%)$ . To minimize magnetic overprinting on the cored sediment, the nonmagnetic collars and core barrels were used for all APC and HLAPC coring. Shattered cor e liners posed a challenge at each hole. To mitigate the impact of sediment expansion and potentia l core disturbance and to release the overpressure, holes were drilled into the liners both by the dril l crew on the rig floor and the technical staff on the core receiving platform.  

Hole U1618A was started on 14 June. Cores 1H–37X penetrated from the seafloor to 276.9 mbs f with a recovery of $91\%$ . In situ temperature measurements were taken on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, an d

The relationship between $\mathsf{C}_{1}/\mathsf{C}_{2}$ ratios and downhole (i.e., sediment) temperature is one criterion to evaluate the nature of hydrocarbon occurrence. Anomalously low $\mathsf{C}_{1}/\mathsf{C}_{2}$ ratios suggest the presence of migrated thermogenic hydrocarbons (Pimmel and Claypool, 2001; JOIDES Pollution Prevention and Safety Panel, 1992).

Hole U1618B was spudded on 16 June. Its location was offset $50\,\mathrm{m}$ from Hole U1618A at a bearin g of $139^{\circ}$ . A total of 54 cores (Cores 1H–54X) were taken in Hole U1618B over a $414.3~\mathrm{m}$ interva l with $375.24\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered $(90.57\%)$ . The SET2 temperature probe was used to get the two deepes t in situ temperature measurements after coring Cores 403-U1618B-42X and 52X at 324.8 an d 401.5 mbsf, respectively. Coring was terminated on 19 June. Because Hole U1618B was deepe r than Hole U1618A, and another possible coring success in Hole U1618C was uncertain, Hol e U1618B was selected for wireline logging. The triple combination (triple combo) logging too l string and Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic logging tool were successfully deployed and collected geophysical borehole data; however, the Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI) tool was inoperabl e after a power surge caused a failure in the electronics. Logging operations ended on 20 June. I n total, we spent $93.0\,\mathrm{{h}}$ (3.9 days) on Hole U1618B (Table T1).  

Hole U1618C was offset $25~\mathrm{m}$ northwest at a bearing of $319^{\circ}$ from Hole U1618B, halfway towar d Hole U1618A. Coring commenced on 20 June. A total of 61 cores were taken in Hole U1618C, an d a $2~\mathrm{m}$ interval (Core 161) was drilled without recovery to address a correlation offset. Cores 1H– 62X penetrated from the seafloor to 413.1 mbsf; the cored interval was $411.1\mathrm{~m~}$ long, and th e recovery was $450.59\:\mathrm{m}$ $(109.61\%)$ (Table T1). After 3.24 days on this hole, preparations were mad e to get underway to Site U1619.  

# 4.1.3. Principal results  

# 4.1.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The Quaternary sediment record recovered at Site U1618 is primarily siliciclastic, mainly composed of dark gray to greenish black silty clay, with interbedded coarser intervals ranging fro m clayey silt to diamicton. Detrital clasts are present throughout most of the record in varyin g abundances. Although sedimentary structures were often not visible on the split core surfaces (i.e., described as structureless), laminated and bioturbated intervals were distinguishable on th e X-radiographs (Figure F8A). Preliminary comparisons between patterns of sedimentary facie s observed on the Site U1618 X-radiographs and well-established lithofacies from shallow pisto n cores of the western margin of Svalbard (i.e., Lucchi et al., 2013, 2023) suggest that the sedimentary record at Site U1618 can be used to identify evidence of past shelf edge glaciation, ice-calvin g and paleomeltwater events.  

Diagenetic overprinting of the primary depositional record becomes increasingly common downcore, especially below $\mathord{\sim}150$ mbsf, which corresponds to Seismic Reflector R5. The postdepositional alteration is evident by the presence of authigenic carbonate and Fe-sulfide (pyrite and/o r greigite) minerals, sometimes occurring as concretions or burrow infillings (Figure F8B). Ga s escape features, including voids and fractures, are common, especially between $\mathord{\sim}150$ and 19 0 mbsf.  

The base of the Site U1618 record is Pliocene in age (Figure F9). It is marked by the presence o f prominent laminations in dark gray to black silty clay, an increase in the relative abundance o f smectite, and the absence of diamictons.  

# 4.1.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

No microfossil group is consistently present in the Site U1618 sediment record, and several intervals are barren. This was not unexpected given the high-latitude setting. During ODP Leg 151, similar challenges were experienced in the Fram Strait, with limited diversity and abundance in th e Quaternary to early Pliocene sediments (Myhre et al., 1995; Thiede and Myhre, 1996). Additionally, postdepositional interstitial water (IW) reactions in the Vestnesa Ridge gas hydrate–bearin g sedimentary system may have influenced the preservation of biogenic carbonate and biogenic silica (Si). At Site U1618, diatoms are present at the very top (Holocene), with limited occurrences o f mostly fragments downcore. Foraminifera are present in the upper part but disappear downcore. Calcareous nannofossils are generally present, but the lower part of the record is mainly barren. Dinocysts are present throughout the sediment column but are absent occasionally.  

An initial paleoenvironmental assessment based on the four microfossil groups generally indicate s Arctic to polar surface waters and seasonal sea ice conditions throughout most of the Quaternary. Polar surface waters are colder and slightly less saline than Arctic water masses that are defined a s a mixture of Polar and Atlantic water masses following definitions of water masses in the Fra m Strait today (e.g., Hopkins, 1991). Exceptions are the cold–temperate conditions and Atlanti c water incursion during or near the (tentatively identified) Jaramillo Subchron and occasiona l incursions of temperate waters in the Early Pleistocene. Some reworking of pre-Neogene deposit s is evident in all microfossil groups. Input of reworked microfossils is consistent with processes o f glacial erosion of sedimentary outcrops on Svalbard, remobilization of deposits in fjords and o n the shelf, and delivery to the ocean through glaciomarine depositional processes (Figure F4).  

Barren intervals notwithstanding, age-diagnostic microfossils are present from the seafloor to th e base of Site U1618, with calcareous nannofossils and dinoflagellate cysts providing most of th e initial microfossil-based age-depth markers (Figure F10). MISs 1, 3–5, and 11–13 and older ar e identifiable by age-diagnostic markers. Dinoflagellate cyst biostratigraphy indicates hints of Pliocene flora (older than ${\sim}2.7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ) near the base of the record $(>\!390{\mathrm{~m}})$ . This finding is supported b y intermittent intervals of diatom fragments, which indicate ages of at least $2.58\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Figure F9).  

# 4.1.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Site U1618 sediments have a wide range of magnetic properties that likely reflect contributio n from detrital and authigenic sources. Stratigraphically below the first reversed direction (at ${\sim}90$ mbsf), many intervals appear to have been remagnetized. These data are consistent with the formation of authigenic greigite (Figure F8B), which would acquire a chemical remanent magnetization that is younger than the detrital remanent magnetization of the surrounding sediment. Nevertheless, intervals dominated by detrital sources provided suitable paleomagnetic records t o determine an initial magnetic stratigraphy. There is great potential to refine the magnetic stratigraphy at Site U1618 with higher resolution paleomagnetic investigation to characterize the natura l remanent magnetization (NRM) in the context of detailed rock magnetic investigations and t o characterize magnetic mineral assemblages (Figure F11).

# 4.1.3.4. Age model  

Although determination of magnetic polarity zones was complicated by the potential for chemica l remanent magnetizations hosted by the authigenic mineral greigite, three major polarity zone s were confidently interpreted to reflect Chrons C1n (Brunhes; $0{-}0.773\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ), C1r–C2r (Matuyama; 0.773–2.595 Ma), and C2An (Gauss; 2.595–3.596 Ma). These interpretations are in good agreement with the shipboard biostratigraphy. No hiatuses are identified at this early stage, althoug h there are some conflicting initial age assignments between 0.90 and 1.07 mbsf. The preliminar y age model indicates an average sedimentation rate of $147~\mathrm{m/My}$ between ${\sim}2.6$ and ${\sim}1\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Figur e F12). A high sedimentation rate is expected given the proximity of Site U1618 to the paleo-SBSIS, which was documented to have first reached the shelf edge concurrent with the expansion of NH G at $2.7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Alexandropoulou et al., 2021). A decrease in sedimentation rate to $104\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{My}$ since ${\sim}1.0$ Ma is consistent in timing with decreased sedimentation at ODP Site 908 (Hovgaard Ridge), OD P Site 909 (Molloy Basin), and ODP Site 911 (Yermak Plateau) (Myhre et al., 1995; Thiede an d Myhre, 1996). Such a regional change in sedimentation rate may reflect changes in the depositional environment, perhaps related to the position or strength of the WSC, which is a bathymetrically controlled current and therefore may also be related to climate-induced relative sea leve l changes. Alternatively, or additionally, these sedimentation rate changes may be related to chang e in ice sheet dynamics as glacial cyclicity shifted from 41 to $100\;\mathrm{ky}$ cycles during the MPT $(\mathord{\sim}0.9-$ $1.0\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ).  

# 4.1.3.5. Physical properties  

Results from physical property measurements for Site U1618 show relationships to both lithologi c and paleomagnetic findings and appear to be influenced by glaciogenic deposition and postdepositional processes. Magnetic susceptibility (MS) covaries with natural gamma radiation (NGR) an d gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density above $\mathord{\sim}150$ mbsf, and NGR and GRA density show  a positive linear correlation over this interval. Based on initial comparison to shallow sedimen t records from piston cores on the Svalbard margin, these physical property data show potential fo r identifying different glaciogenic lithofacies, such as meltwater events and mass transport deposition related to shelf edge glaciation, which are important for reconstructing paleo–ice shee t dynamics. Below ${\sim}150~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , irregularly spaced, large peaks in MS become prevalent and appea r to correlate with the occurrence of authigenic Fe-sulfide minerals.

Botto m right: black-yellow-brown laminations and selective enrichment (black laminae) and authigenic carbonates (yellow laminae) in an overall quartz and clay mineral–rich bulk sedimentation (brown sediments).  

In addition to the standard suite of physical property measurements, anelastic strain recover y (ASR) experiments were conducted on three whole-round samples using strain gauges connecte d to the sample. Preliminary results show that after temperature equilibrium, strain released logarithmically, but some gauges showed shrinking of the sediments. Additional processing postexpedition will aim to determine the principal stress azimuths; such information contributes to th e tectonics objectives of the expedition.

Stratigraphic correlation between holes was primarily accomplished using MS in the uppermos t $150\,\textrm{m}$ and red-green-blue color space (RGB)-red and NGR for constructing the deeper splic e because the MS signal was influenced by postdepositional alteration. The best recovered stratigraphic interval of Hole U1618C was used as the backbone of the splice. Because of gas expansion, a growth factor of 1.1 was applied to cores below $294.2\;\mathrm{m}$ core composite depth below seafloo r (CCSF). Calculation of mass accumulation rates based on the CCSF scale should account for th e expansion by dividing apparent depth intervals by the appropriate growth factor.

# 4.1.3.7. Geochemistry  

Headspace gas measurement and IW analyses suggest anaerobic conditions below ${\sim}20$ mbsf. Th e sulfate–methane transition zone (SMTZ), characterized by sulfate depletion and methan e increase, occurs between ${\sim}12$ and 20 mbsf. These and other (e.g., calcium [Ca] and iron [Fe]) I W chemistry findings document fluid migration in the sediments. The effects of fluid migration ma y explain the diachronous formation of Fe-sulfide minerals. Documented methane seeps at the surface of the east Vestnesa Ridge (Bünz et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2014; Plaza-Faverola et al., 2015; Panieri et al., 2023) are also likely related to fluid migration. Additionally, highly alkaline IW likel y contributed to the poor preservation of diatoms in the sediment record.

A co-related linear decrease of chloride (Cl), sodium $\left(\mathrm{Na}\right)$ , and salinity downcore indicates freshening of the IWs, suggesting a diffusion of fluids deeper than $406.26\:\mathrm{m}$ and possibly indicating tha t gas hydrate dissociation occurred deeper than core recovery.  

Total organic carbon (TOC) at Site U1618 ranges between $0\%$ and $2\%$ and generally increases wit h depth. TOC/total nitrogen (TN) ratios, which are commonly used to identify sources of sedimentary organic matter, indicate contributions from both continental (e.g., ice sheet derived) an d marine sources of organic matter. Low-resolution shipboard sampling also suggests that increase d TOC/TN ratios generally correlate to coarse-grained lithologies, consistent with a terrestrial origin of the organic carbon at those horizons.  

In addition to standard shipboard geochemistry measurements, samples for sedimentary ancien t DNA (sedaDNA) were taken in contamination-controlled conditions. Although analyses of th e sedaDNA samples will occur postexpedition, the analysis of control samples indicated that corin g with the APC systems (i.e., APC and HLAPC) resulted in lower drill fluid contamination of th e sedaDNA control samples $(15\%)$ than occurred when coring with the XCB system $(57\%)$ . The contamination difference is likely due to the increased core disturbance (e.g., fracturing or biscuiting ) produced by the XCB system. Nevertheless, these findings also indicate that it is possible to obtai n uncontaminated sedaDNA samples with both types of coring approaches, extending the potentia l for sedaDNA studies in a wider range of drilling conditions than previously documented in marin e sediments.

# 4.1.3.8. Downhole logging  

Downhole logging measurements of natural gamma ray, GRA density, and MS showed simila r trends as shipboard scanning data, including apparent cyclic changes in amplitude of natura l gamma ray and GRA density. FMS imaging of the borehole was limited because the FMS caliper s were not able to maintain contact with the borehole walls. Although the absolute values of th e porosity data are anomalously high due to poor borehole conditions, the relative changes in porosity show correlation with density and electrical resistivity across several intervals. At ${\sim}190{-}200$ mbsf, low electrical resistivity values were observed, which correspond to a logged interval of lo w density and high porosity material, pointing to the possibility of higher water content. These conditions are tentatively hypothesized to mark the base of the gas hydrate stability zone. In marin e sedimentary sequences, the gas hydrate stability zone can be estimated from pressure (i.e., depth ) and downhole temperature data (Kvenvolden and Barnard, 1983). Linear regression of the in sit u formation temperature measurements made during coring indicates a typical geothermal gradien t at Site U1618. Based on this geothermal gradient, the base of the gas hydrate stability zone at Sit e U1618 is estimated to be at $\mathord{\sim}200$ mbsf, coinciding with the anomalous zone of higher water content.  

Below 25 mbsf, fractures and voids in the recovered sediment cores caused strong attenuation o f the acoustic signal and resulted in erratic shipboard $P$ -wave measurement. This $P_{-}$ -wave behavio r was observed at all Expedition 403 sites and will not be reported further. At Site U1618, downhol e logging Dipole Sonic Imager (DSI) measurements of acoustics waves are also muted. These observations appear consistent with the presence of gas hydrate or free gas in the sediment. However, postprocessing of the DSI data provided meaningful $P.$ -wave velocities at depth, with the mos t prominent variability below ${\sim}230$ mbsf. These data seem to support the hypothesis that the ga s hydrate stability zone is above this depth.  

# 4.2. Site U1619  

# 4.2.1. Background and objectives  

Like Site U1618, Site U1619 is located on the Vestnesa Ridge but was sited at the west terminatio n (Figure F1), representing a distal glaciogenic depositional reach and a potentially better location t o record the WSC variability. The Vestnesa Ridge is a roughly east–west-oriented prominent bathymetric feature situated in the Fram Strait on the western continental margin of Svalbard. Its evolution is linked to the tectonic, sedimentary, and climatic history of the region, making it a foca l point for multidisciplinary scientific research. The $100\,\mathrm{km}$ long ridge is a sediment drift generate d by persistent bottom currents associated with the WSC (Eiken and Hinz, 1993) that develope d over oceanic crust since the Fram Strait opening $({\sim}19\,\,\mathrm{My})$ (Engen et al., 2008). Although th e chronology of the Vestnesa Ridge sediment record deposited since the last glacial is well established and regionally correlatable (Lucchi et al., 2023), the chronology prior to MISs 3 and 4 i s limited to extrapolation made through seismic from previously drilled sites on the Yermak Platea u (ODP Site 912) and south of the MTF (ODP Site 909) (Eiken and Hinz, 1993; Knies et al., 2014; Mattingsdal et al., 2014).  

The sedimentation and geological development in this area has been heavily influenced by th e Pliocene–Pleistocene glaciations, especially the ice sheet extent over Svalbard and the Barents Sea, as well as the Arctic Ocean sea ice extent (Jakobsson et al., 2014). Depositional facies representin g a range of glaciogenic and bottom current depositional processes are well documented in th e recent sedimentary record along the western Svalbard continental margin (e.g., Jessen et al., 2010; Lucchi et al., 2013, 2015; Caricchi et al., 2019) and the Vestnesa Ridge (Schneider et al., 2018; Sztybor and Rasmussen, 2017a; Plaza-Faverola et al., 2023). The presence of gas hydrates and associated fluid migration are additional controls on the sedimentary record of the Vestnesa Ridge, although they have more effect in the central and eastern areas of the ridge than in the wester n extension.  

The west termination of the Vestnesa Ridge is characterized by a larger $_{>10\;\mathrm{km}}$ wide) crest tha n exists in the east; it contains small, apparently inactive pockmarks, although multidisciplinar y investigations point to the presence of methane in the subseafloor (e.g., Consolaro et al., 2015; Plaza-Faverola et al., 2015; Sultan et al., 2020).  

Site U1619 (proposed Site VRW-03A; Lucchi et al., 2023) on the Vestnesa Ridge west terminatio n was chosen as the northernmost site of Expedition 403. The site is well situated to provide a recor d of both high-resolution variability and long-term changes in the northward penetration of Nort h Atlantic waters transported by the WSC across the gateway to the Arctic (Fram Strait). The mor e distal setting of Site U1619 compared to Site U1618 also provides the opportunity to laterally trac e glaciogenic deposits originating from the paleo-SBSIS, as well as examine the history of Arctic se a ice extent into the Fram Strait. For these reasons, sediment drift Site U1619 is ideal for paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic studies that can complement the research from prior scientific ocea n drilling sites farther north (e.g., ODP Sites 910 and 912 [Yermak Plateau]) and to the south (e.g., ODP Sites 908 [Hovgaard Ridge] and 909 [Molloy Basin]) (Myhre et al., 1995; Thiede and Myhre, 1996). Seismic Reflectors R1–R8 were drilling targets for Site U1619, with a total depth target o f 696 mbsf (Figure F13). No gas hydrate–related BSR was detected close to Site U1619.  

At Site U1619, the main initial objective was to recover a complete stratigraphy from Seismi c Reflector R8 ${\sim}5.8\,\mathrm{Ma})$ to present. Such recovery would support the following research goals:  

• Definition of a high-resolution sediment stratigraphy since the Late Miocene–Early Pliocene transition;   
• Reconstruction of the variability of the WSC transporting warm Atlantic Water to the Arctic;   
• Definition of the effect of glacial and tectonic stresses on subseafloor sediment deformation and carbon transport; and   
• Investigation of the influence of the WSC variability, ice coverage, and climate on the microbial populations through time and to what extent this is still affecting contemporary geochemical fluxes.

# 4.2.2. Operations  

Site U1619 comprises a single hole (U1619A) drilled at a $1676\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth and reaching a subseafloor penetration of 628 mbsf (Figure F5; Table T1). Hole U1619A is positioned at the cros s point of two seismic lines: CAGE20-5-HH-11-2D and CAGE20-5-HH-10-2D (Figure F13). Th e hole was spudded on 23 June 2024. Because the Vestnesa Ridge is known to contain gas hydrate s and free gas, methane and other hydrocarbon gases were monitored with headspace gas measurements on each core and select void gas sample (VAC) sampling. Although gas expansion affecte d core recovery and handling, the $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratios remained inside the safety zone for drilling operation s (Figure F7). To relieve gas overpressure, holes were drilled into liners both by the drill crew on th e rig floor and the technical staff on the core receiving platform. Shattered liners were an occasiona l challenge. As formation characteristics changed, deployment of the APC system shifted to th e HLAPC system and later to the XCB drilling system at depth. Most XCB cores were advanced b y $_{6-8\textrm{m}}$ to allow for gas expansion of the sediments in the liners. Gas expansion resulted in cor e recoveries typically between $104\%$ and $120\%$ . To minimize magnetic overprinting on the core d sediment, the nonmagnetic collars and core barrels were used for all APC and HLAPC coring.  A total of 85 cores were drilled: 11 APC $(13\%)$ , 11 HLAPC $(13\%)$ , and 63 XPC $(74\%)$ . The cored interval of $627.9\;\mathrm{m}$ resulted in a recovered length of $728.35~\mathrm{m}$ . Formation temperature measurement s were taken with the APCT-3 and SET2 tools.  

Ice navigation was essential for this site. When the marginal sea ice zone had moved to within  3 nmi of the vessel, the bridge determined that it was necessary to move off location. Hole U1619 A was terminated on 28 June before sea ice began to move into the area. At that point, a drillin g depth of $629.9\;\mathrm{m}$ had been reached. A free-fall funnel was deployed in hopes that the ship coul d reoccupy the hole to reach the target depth $(738\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ ); however, ongoing unfavorable sea ice conditions prevented a return to this location. A total of 5.2 days were spent on Hole U1619A, whic h provided the longest cored sequence of the expedition.  

# 4.2.3. Principal results  

# 4.2.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The Site U1619 sediments are primarily siliciclastic, composed of gray to dark greenish-gray silt y clay, clayey silt, clay, and sandy mud. Sediments are commonly bioturbated from the base of th e record to ${\sim}175$ mbsf, with occasionally laminated intervals occurring from the base of the recor d to $\mathord{\sim}268$ mbsf (Figure F9). These depositional characteristics suggest the older sequence at Sit e U1619 contains a long duration contouritic deposition settled under variable-strength and welloxygenated bottom currents. Detrital clasts are present throughout the hole (Figure F8A), with  a stepwise, uphole increasing frequency of clast abundance between ${\sim}530$ and 268 mbsf. The timin g closely matches the initial, regular appearance of dark patches on the split core surface and likel y marks the expansion of NHG. High clast abundance continues to $\mathord{\sim}175\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , and above this dept h the abundance becomes more variable, possibly in response to global climate cycles, sea ice variability, and the dynamics of the paleo-SBSIS.  

Similar to Site U1618, diagenetic overprinting of the primary depositional record at Site U1619 i s documented by the presence of authigenic carbonate in the form of layers, laminations, granula r crystals, and Fe-sulfide (pyrite and/or greigite) minerals, which typically occur as burrow infilling s and concretions (Figure F8B). Authigenic mineral occurrences are most common below $\mathord{\sim}150$ mbsf. The Fe-sulfide intervals typically corresponded to very high MS values and were often associated with high-density materials in X-ray images (Figure F8B).  

# 4.2.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

No microfossil group (Figure F10) is consistently present in the Site U1619 sediment record, an d several intervals were barren. Calcareous nannofossil concentrations range from rare to common, and assemblages with moderate to good preservation appear intermittently across the entire core d sequence. Some intervals of reworked nannofossils were also intermittently noted. Diatom assemblages are primarily present at the core top, although some intervals at depth contain traces o f poor assemblages formed by highly silicified diatoms. Dinocysts are present throughout the sediment record, with the number of taxa decreasing downhole. Small acritarchs were also recorded, especially at depth. Moderately preserved foraminifera are present with rare to frequent occurrences in the upper part of Site U1619 and are present intermittently downcore. Below ${\sim}400$ mbsf, samples are barren of foraminifera.  

Paleoenvironmental information based on the latest Pleistocene microfossil assemblages indicate s Arctic-polar water with seasonal sea ice, with occasional influence of warm Atlantic waters. Give n the many barren intervals and limited assemblage counts, any environmental conclusions for th e older Site U1619 sediments are premature.  

The combined information yields of all microfossil groups contributed to an initial biostratigraph y for Site U1619, with calcareous nannofossil zones and dinocyst/acritarch age markers providin g the backbone of the record (Figure F10). An acritarch with a Late Miocene–Pliocene age range i s present near the base of the sampled record. Collectively, the suite of age-diagnostic microfossil s indicates a highly expanded Pliocene to early Pleistocene record at Site U1619. Late Pleistocen e interglacial MISs, including 5 and 7–13, are confirmed by multiple biostratigraphic age markers.  

# 4.2.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Site U1619 had similar magnetic properties to Site U1618. Anhysteretic remanent magnetizatio n (ARM) coercivity, tracked by the $\mathrm{ARM}_{30\mathrm{mT}}/\mathrm{ARM}$ ratio, shows a wide range of values and has  a bimodal distribution (Figure F11), which is likely indicative of the sediments containing a mi x of detrital and authigenic (e.g., greigite) mineral sources. Further work using temperaturedependent, in-field, mineralogical, and scanning electron microscope (SEM)/energy dispersiv e spectrometry (EDS) methods will be needed to gain a more complete understanding of the magnetic minerals present at both Vestnesa Ridge sites.  

Based on shipboard rock magnetic investigations, low MS intervals were identified as having  a greater potential to record high-fidelity remanent magnetization. Therefore, discrete cube samples from undisturbed low MS intervals were used to refine the magnetic stratigraphy derive d from the archive section half NRM and alternating field demagnetization data. A number of polarity reversals were identified using this process, with depth uncertainties ranging from ${<}1{-}40\mathrm{~m~}$ . Postexpedition analyses of cube samples will aim to reduce these and other difficult to quantif y uncertainties. The Site U1619 magnetic stratigraphy indicates that the recovered sequenc e captures the entire Pliocene and Pleistocene record, which is particularly expanded during th e Pliocene and early Pleistocene in agreement with biostratigraphic interpretations. The base o f recovery contains sediments deposited in the latest Miocene during Chron C3r (lower Gilbert), younger than $6\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

# 4.2.3.4. Age model  

The preliminary age model based on the combined magnetic stratigraphy and biostratigraph y indicates linear sedimentation rates of approximately $110\;\mathrm{m/My}$ from the base of the record unti l ${\sim}3.8$ Ma (Figure F12). Between 3.8 and $2.0\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , sedimentation rates were approximately 16 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{M}\mathbf{y}$ , indicating continuous high rates of deposition during both the warm mid-Pliocene and th e transition to widespread NHG. After $2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , sedimentation rates decrease drastically: first decreasing to ${\sim}70\mathrm{\;m/My}$ between about 2 and 1 Ma and then decreasing to approximately $30\;\mathrm{m/My}$ sinc e $1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . This later change in sedimentation rates coincides with the MPT, and it is also observed a t the Eastern Vestnesa Ridge (Site U1618). Site U1619 is well suited to examine if more extensive se a ice cover (e.g., Stein and Fahl, 2013) may have a role in changing depositional patterns and thu s sedimentation rates in the Fram Strait region.  

# 4.2.3.5. Physical properties  

Like Site U1618, the measured physical property data for Site U1619 show relationships to bot h lithologic and paleomagnetic findings. MS peaks orders of magnitude higher than the backgroun d appear below $\mathord{\sim}150$ mbsf and become more prominent downcore. These MS maxima are likel y associated with the formation of authigenic Fe-sulfide minerals like greigite. There is a positiv e linear correlation between NGR and GRA bulk density; both generally show high-amplitude variability in the uppermost ${\sim}270\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , and the mean values of both parameters increase downhole. Both parameters have modes that differ between the clast-rich silty clays present in the upper par t of the record and the bioturbated, clast-poor silty clays present in the lower part of the record. Tw o different MS modes are observed within the lower lithostratigraphic unit (below ${\sim}268~\mathrm{m}$ ): broa d stratigraphic intervals of low MS $^{<50\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}}_{\phantom{}}$ ) alternating with shorter stratigraphic intervals o f large MS peaks. Higher NGR and GRA bulk density combined with both low and high MS mode s may suggest that clay-rich (high NGR), compacted sediments (high GRA bulk density) are les s likely to accommodate fluid movement, leading to greater retention of a primary magnetizatio n (low MS) flanked by horizons associated with the formation of authigenic Fe-sulfide mineral s (high MS). This hypothesis can be explored further with postexpedition analyses.  

In addition to standard shipboard physical property data collection, Site U1619 included on e whole-round sample that relates to the tectonic objectives of the expedition. Initial results sho w that after temperature equilibrium, strain released logarithmically. Initial results also show som e shrinking, which is hypothesized to be related to pore pressure changes from degassing.  

# 4.2.3.6. Stratigraphic correlation  

Because only a single hole was drilled at Site U1619, there was no need for stratigraphic correlation. Very good recovery with minimal coring gaps provides a good record for long-term reconstructions. The CCSF scale takes into account core expansion and has a growth factor of ${\sim}1.18$ . Calculation of mass accumulation rates based on the CCSF scale should account for the expansio n by dividing apparent depth intervals by the appropriate growth factor.  

# 4.2.3.7. Geochemistry  

Shipboard sulfate measurements of the Site U1619 IW and headspace gas measurements indicat e that the SMTZ is likely between ${\sim}7$ and 18 mbsf. The geochemical profiles above and within th e SMTZ show decreases in salinity, Ca, magnesium $\left(\mathrm{Mg}\right)$ , strontium (Sr), Fe, manganese (Mn), an d sulfate $(\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-})$ and increases in barium (Ba), phosphate $\mathrm{(PO_{4}^{3-})}$ , alkalinity, and ammonium $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}\right)$ . Below the SMTZ, $\mathrm{Mg}$ concentrations and alkalinity continue to decrease, whereas Ca, Sr, Ba, lithium (Li), and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ concentrations increase. Reducing conditions and diagenetic processes associated with free gas and possible gas hydrate are likely important controlling processes on several o f the IW profiles, as well as on methane and other hydrocarbon abundances at Site U1619. In addition, sediment geochemistry results showing highly variable calcium carbonate $\left(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\right)$ abundances that peak at ${\sim}480$ mbsf likely point to authigenic mineral formation during diagenesi s (Figure F8B).  

Other geochemical results appear to be driven by paleoceanographic and/or paleoclimatic processes. Dissolved Si shows considerable stratigraphic variability. The maximum Si in IW appear s at ${\sim}280~\mathrm{mbsf_{\mathrm{:}}}$ , which, given the initial age model, may correspond to mPWP. The TOC/TN rati o shows stratigraphic variations as well. After an increase in mean TOC/TN ratios from the base o f the record to $\mathord{\sim}380$ mbsf, the TOC/TN ratio decreases to its lowest level at ${\sim}280\,\mathrm{mbsf_{\mathrm{:}}}$ , indicating  a strong marine organic carbon signal at that time. A second stepwise increase in the TOC/TN rati o immediately follows and peaks at $\mathord{\sim}150$ mbsf. This timing suggests increased organic matter fro m continental sources during the intensification of NHG.  

In addition, microbiological sampling of the sediment at ${\sim}400$ mbsf was done to test (postexpedition) for the oldest recoverable sedaDNA.  

# 4.2.3.8. Downhole measurements  

Borehole measurements made while coring Hole U1619A show that formation temperature at th e western Vestnesa Ridge increases almost linearly with depth and has a geothermal gradient typica l for oceanic sediments when compared with the statistical data set (Kolawole and Evenick, 2023).  

# 4.3. Site U1620  

# 4.3.1. Background and objectives  

The Svyatogor Ridge is a northwest–southeast elongated contouritic sediment drift lying o n young $(<\!10\mathrm{\Ma})$ oceanic crust. This sediment drift has a length of $46~\mathrm{km}$ and a width of $5~\mathrm{km}$ (Johnson et al., 2015; Waghorn et al., 2018) and is located ${\sim}130~\mathrm{km}$ from the western margin o f Svalbard on the northwestern flank of the ultraslow-spreading Knipovich Ridge, south of the MT F (Figure F1). The sediment record at Svyatogor has been influenced by multiple factors, includin g the locally complex tectonic history, the evolution of the WSC, the development of regional ic e sheets, and the presence and migration of methane gas with likely biotic and abiotic sources (Waghorn et al., 2020).  

According to Eiken and Hinz (1993), three main stratigraphic units provide the chronological constraints on the northwestern margin of Svalbard. Unit YP-1 is the oldest, and it is composed o f syn- and postrift sediments lying directly on the oceanic crust after the opening of the Fram Strai t during the early Miocene $\mathbf{\omega^{\sim17}\,M a_{\scriptscriptstyle\mathrm{,}}}$ ; Jakobsson et al., 2007; Ehlers and Jokat, 2013), creating an environment favorable for the onset of contour currents (Eiken and Hinz, 1993; Gebhardt et al., 2014). Seismic Stratigraphic Unit YP-2 contains the sedimentation associated with contour curren t deposition having a basal age between 11 and $14.6\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , whereas Unit YP-3 comprises the deposition associated with the onset of glacially transported sediments like glaciomarine deposits an d glacial debris flows. Correlation with the cores drilled during ODP Leg 151 indicates a boundar y age between Units YP-2 and YP-3 of ${\sim}2.7~\mathrm{Ma}$ , corresponding to the intensification of the NH G (Geissler et al., 2011; Mattingsdal et al., 2014). Based on the supposition that the Svyatogor Ridg e experienced its initial growth as a southern extension of the Vestnesa Ridge across the MTF a t ${\sim}2.7$ Ma (Johnson et al., 2015), Unit YP-3 and potentially the upper portion of Unit YP-2 shoul d also be present on the Svyatogor Ridge.  

Besides this general stratigraphic information for the area, the chronostratigraphy at the Svyatogo r site is largely unknown because exploration has mostly been limited to geophysical survey s focused on characterizing the unique fluid flow system of this ridge. Because of the underlyin g young crust and the proximity to the ultraslow-spreading Knipovich Ridge, the Svyatogor sediment drift likely contains a unique combination of biogenic-derived methane and abioticall y derived gas generated from the serpentinization of exhumed mantle rocks; this complex syste m contributes to an extensive occurrence of free gas, gas hydrate, and fluid flow systems in th e region, with gas chimney and faults acting as a major pathway for fluid migration (Johnson et al., 2015; Waghorn et al., 2020).  

Site U1620 on the Svyatogor Ridge was chosen for its distal location from the western margin o f Svalbard; therefore it has a reduced (yet discernible) continental impact on the sedimentation an d an enhanced paleoceanographic signal that is mainly driven by the oceanic current. The relationships between sediment drift development, bathymetry, and tectonic motion are additional factor s unique to this location that can be examined. Furthermore, because this is an almost unexplore d area, the documented presence of a young oceanic crust and active seepage system can drive unexpected new findings in relation to fluid flow, diagenesis, and the subsurface microbial community.  

At Site U1620, the main initial objective was to recover a complete stratigraphy from Seismi c Reflector R7 $\left(2.7\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ to present. Such a recovery would support the following research goals:  

• Definition of a high-resolution sediment stratigraphy since the Late Pliocene intensification of the NHG;   
• Reconstruction of the variability of the WSC transporting warm Atlantic water to the Arctic;   
• Definition of the effect of glacial and tectonic stresses on subseafloor sediment deformation and carbon transport; and   
• Investigation of the influence of the WSC variability, ice coverage, climate, and the active seepage system on the microbial populations through time and to what extent this is still affecting contemporary geochemical fluxes.  

Additionally, because the drilled stratigraphic sequence at Site U1620 is the first recovered recor d of the Svyatogor Ridge that extends hundreds of meters deeper than any previous coring work i n this area, there is a unique opportunity to groundtruth hypotheses concerning gas-charged sediment drifts that overlie young (i.e., warm) oceanic crust.  

# 4.3.2. Operations  

We arrived at Site U1620 (proposed Site SVR-03A; Lucchi et al., 2023) on 29 June 2024 after transiting from Site U1619. During the approximately 8 days on site, four holes were drilled along Seismic Line Svyatogor2014_3D-XL222 (Figure F14) and one hole was logged (Table T1; Figure F5). The holes are between 1589 and 1609 mbsl. Careful attention was given to the location of hole s because of the tectonic setting and subseafloor gas hydrate system. Hole U1620A is located ${\sim}0.75$ km northeast of a fault, which on seismic profile (Figure F14) appeared to be a conduit leading t o a gas chimney. Holes U1620B–U1620D are located within $200\;\mathrm{m}$ northeast of Hole U1620A, awa y from these subsurface features. The mudline was poorly recovered in Hole U1620B, and therefor e Hole U1620C was spudded immediately adjacent to it. Hole U1620D is located approximatel y halfway between Holes U1620A and U1620B/U1620C and is the deepest hole, meeting the targe t depth of 616 mbsf; therefore, it was selected for logging. The combined cored interval from al l four holes was $1026.2\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

The presence of subsurface gas was a challenge at each hole. Methane and other hydrocarbo n gases were monitored with headspace gas measurements on each core and select VAC sampling. Although $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratios consistently plotted in or near the anomalous zone for the uppermost $255\;\mathrm{m}$ in all holes (Figure F7), the methane was deemed biogenically sourced and coring was approved t o continue. When $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratios remained low in several consecutive cores and higher hydrocarbon s (e.g., $C_{5}$ and $C_{6},$ were also present, the holes were terminated. For gas safety when handling th e cores and to minimize core expansion, holes were drilled into the liner on the rig floor and on th e core receiving platform and Kevlar blankets were used as shields during the initial core handling. Shattered or broken liners were common. Core expansion resulted in core recovery often exceeding $100\%$ , with a total recovered length of $1132.2\;\mathrm{m}\;(110\%)$ . Knowing that the Site U1620 sedimen t sequence overlies young (i.e., warm) oceanic crust and that the geothermal gradient factors int o the gas safety evaluation, additional borehole temperature measurements were made. These measurements ceased when the borehole SET2 tool approached the instrumental limit $(50^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . As formation characteristics changed at each hole, deployment of the APC system shifted to the XC B drilling system at different depths with advances by $_{6-8\textrm{m}}$ to allow for gas expansion of the sediments in the core liner. At Site U1620, a total of 126 cores were retrieved: 38 APC $(30\%)$ and 8 8 XCB $(70\%)$ . To minimize magnetic overprinting on the cored sediment, the nonmagnetic collar s and core barrels were used for all APC coring.  

Hole U1620A was started on 29 June. Cores 1H–31X penetrated from the seafloor to 239.9 mbs f with a recovery of $116\%$ . Formation temperature measurements were taken on core runs for Core s 4H, 7H, 10H, and 13H using the APCT-3 tool. Two additional temperature measurements wer e taken using the SET2 probe after Cores 18X (48 mbsf) and 31X (239.9 mbsf). In total, we spent 1. 7 days on Hole U1620A.  

Hole U1620B was offset $200\,\mathrm{m}$ from Hole U1620A at a bearing of $63.9^{\circ}$ . It was spudded on 30 June, but after two attempts at a mudline core and a recovery of only $0.34\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , the hole was terminated. Hole U1620C was promptly spudded at the same location and retrieved a good mudline core.  A total of 21 cores (1H–21X) were taken in Hole U1620C over a $169.9\,\mathrm{m}$ interval with $186.9\,\mathrm{m}$ recovered $(109.99\%)$ . The APCT-3 tool was deployed on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, and 13H for in situ temperature measurement. Coring was terminated on 1 July.

Interpreted location of th e underlying basement, multiple faults, and free gas are also shown.  

Hole U1620D was offset $100\mathrm{~m~}$ southeast of Hole U1620C at a bearing of $244^{\circ}$ , halfway towar d Hole U1620A. The first core was spudded on 2 July. A total of 73 cores were taken in Hol e U1620D. The cored interval spanning Cores 1H–73X was $616\;\mathrm{m}$ long, and the recovery was 667.8 9 m $(108.42\%)$ ). The SET2 tool was used to take the two deepest borehole temperature measurements for the site: one after Core 38X (298 mbsf) and one after Core 44X $(346.8~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ). Becaus e Hole U1620D was the deepest hole, it was selected for wireline logging. The triple combo loggin g tool string was successfully deployed and collected geophysical borehole data; however, due t o poor hole stability, the planned logging run of the FMS-sonic tool was canceled and operation s were terminated on 6 July. In total, we spent 4.8 days on Hole U1620D and 7.7 days at Site U1620.  

# 4.3.3. Principal results  

# 4.3.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The entire record at Site U1620 is siliciclastic dominated, composed primarily of gray/dark gray t o greenish gray silty clay, with coarser intervals of clayey silt, sandy clay, sandy mud, and uncommonly diamicton (Figures F8A, F9). The stratigraphically deepest part of the record tends to b e more clay rich overall; coarser intervals become more common above ${\sim}321$ mbsf. Dispersed t o abundant detrital clasts are present throughout, with stepwise increases in abundance from th e same depth of ${\sim}334$ mbsf, likely corresponding to the expansion of NHG, and at ${\sim}220\,\mathrm{mbsf_{\mathrm{:}}}$ , possibly corresponding to a second-phase expansion of the paleo-SBSIS. Toward the top of th e sequence, above ${\sim}30{-}50~\mathrm{mbsf},$ silty lithologies are more common and the sediment is more consistently moderately bioturbation, whereas clast abundance is more variable by hole. This lithologic transition appears to occur during the MPT $({\sim}0.9{-}1.0\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . Throughout the record, heavil y bioturbated intervals tend to contain fewer large clasts. Laminated intervals are infrequent an d contain varying amounts (none to abundant) of clasts.  

Secondary minerals, including authigenic carbonate (e.g., calcite and siderite) and Fe-sulfides (e.g., pyrite and/or greigite) are evidence of postdepositional alteration likely caused by elementa l exchanges between the sediment and IW as fluids migrate in this gas- and gas hydrate–enriche d sediment drift. Authigenic carbonate occurs in many forms, including as selective lamination s (Figure F8B), granules, and nodules, as well as intergranular cement, lithifying sand-rich layer s over $10~\mathrm{cm}$ thick. These minerals appear below ${\sim}116$ mbsf and are most abundant below ${\sim}345$ mbsf. Authigenic Fe-sulfide minerals often appear as granular layers and as burrow infillings; the y begin to appear at ${\sim}50$ mbsf and are most prevalent below ${\sim}125$ mbsf.  

# 4.3.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

Preliminary shipboard analyses indicate that the presence of microfossil groups (Figure F10) a t Site U1620 ranges from abundant to barren. Calcareous nannofossils appear intermittently; whe n present, the diversity is low but the concentration of specimens ranges between common an d abundant with moderate to good preservation. Planktonic foraminifera are low in diversity an d appear more preservationally challenged than the calcareous nannofossils, showing deterioratio n at 39 mbsf, and are generally absent below 40 mbsf. Rare encrusted and/or partially dissolve d planktonic foraminifera reappear near the base of the record. Samples are also almost barren o f diatoms, except at the top of the record (Holocene), which shows well-preserved, high-diversit y assemblages, and in some intermittent intervals downhole in Holes U1620A–U1620D. Dinocys t assemblages are also low in diversity but present throughout the Site U1620 record with fe w exceptions. The dinocysts show good to excellent preservation in the upper part of the record an d medium to good preservation in the lower part of the record. Reworking of all microfossils is frequently observed, likely related to transport and redeposition of glacially eroded old stratigraphi c units from the Svalbard margin. Reworked palynomorphs include large amounts of terrestria l plant material.  

Initial paleoenvironmental assessment based on the microfossil assemblage suggests a Pleistocen e paleoenvironment dominated by Arctic to polar surface waters with (seasonal) sea ice, as well a s times with cool-temperate conditions, increased presence of Atlantic water, and seasonal sea ice. During the late Pliocene, sea ice was reduced and surface waters were temperate.  

Shipboard biostratigraphic data show that the Site U1620 stratigraphy ranges in age from at leas t the Late Pliocene to Pleistocene, with Holocene at the very top of the record. Age-diagnosti c markers for intervals containing MISs 1–5 and 7–13 and older warm interglacial periods (e.g., MI S 31) are present, as well as taxa that place the deeper samples firmly in narrow age brackets withi n the middle and early Pleistocene, and the Late Pliocene.  

# 4.3.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

The sediment magnetic properties at Site U1620 are similar to those observed at Sites U1618 an d U1619, reflecting contributions from both detrital and authigenic sources. Additional shipboar d analyses were done to evaluate the magnetic overprinting from authigenic Fe-sulfide (e.g., greigite; Figure F11) formation that produces anomalously high MS peaks and chemical remanent magnetization that is younger than the detrital remanent magnetization of the surrounding sediment.  A magnetic polarity pattern emerged by filtering the archive-half NRM data for intervals with lowe r MS and by augmenting routine NRM analyses with additional discrete cube samples from low M S intervals, avoiding sampling of greigite-rich layers. Magnetic chrons from the top of Chro n C2An.1n (Gauss/Matuyama Boundary; $2.6\,\mathrm{Ma}_{\ast}$ ) through the C2An.2r Subchron (Mammoth; 3.21– $3.33\,\mathrm{Ma}_{\star}^{\phantom{\dagger}}$ ) were identified.  

# 4.3.3.4. Age model  

Biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy are the basis for the preliminary age-depth model fo r Site U1620 (Figure F12). These data are in good agreement for the uppermost ${\sim}115\;\mathrm{m}$ and belo w ${\sim}420$ mbsf, but some age discrepancies exist between these horizons; additional sampling an d postexpedition analyses are needed to better constrain ages. The preliminary age model indicate s a very high sedimentation rate of approximately $325\;\mathrm{m/My}$ between ${\sim}3.33$ and ${\sim}2\,M\mathbf{a}$ . In contrast, between 2 and 1 Ma, average sedimentation rates were probably closer to $75\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{My},$ , and since 1 M a they have been approximately $50\;\mathrm{m/My}.$  

# 4.3.3.5. Physical properties  

Physical property measurements of NGR and GRA bulk density display robust and correlative patterns suggestive of cyclicities throughout the Site U1620 sediment record. MS also correlates wit h these data down to the depth of Fe-sulfide appearance (consistent from ${\sim}125$ mbsf), causing authigenic magnetic overprinting. Color reflectance $\left(\mathbb{L}^{*}\right)$ of the split core surfaces also shows pattern s suggestive of orbital cyclicity throughout the record and additionally displays prominent longterm $(30{-}90\mathrm{~m~}$ thick) packages of lighter versus darker sediment that occur below ${\sim}125$ mbs f (Hole U1620D); this depth coincides with the four-fold change in sedimentation rates at ${\sim}2\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . The physical property measurements included an ASR experiment to study tectonic stress. Simila r to Sites U1618 and U1619, initial findings show strain released logarithmically, but some strai n gauges showed shrinking. Information on principal stress azimuths will be determined after postexpedition data processing.  

# 4.3.3.6. Stratigraphic correlation  

Stratigraphic correlation for holes at Site U1620 was primarily accomplished using MS. The bes t recovered stratigraphy of Hole U1620D was used as the backbone of the splice. Because cor e recovery was generally good, most coring gaps could be covered using data from Holes U1620A, U1620C, and U1620D down to ${\sim}190\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF, and from Holes U1620A and U1620D betwee n $\mathord{\sim}191$ and $271\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF}$ . Only Hole U1620D extends below $271\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF}$ . Gas expansion below $\mathord{\sim}134$ mbsf resulted in growth factors of $15\%{-}30\%$ , which was consistent among all three holes. Calculation of mass accumulation rates based on the CCSF scale should therefore account for the expansion by dividing apparent depth intervals by the appropriate growth factor.  

# 4.3.3.7. Geochemistry  

The IW geochemistry, bulk sediment geochemistry, and headspace gas primarily reflect the influence of deep fluid flow migration at Site U1620. The IW profiles of salinity, Cl, and Na are reflective of (bio)geochemical impacts of a gas hydrate system on IW chemistry at the Svyatogor Ridge. Elemental analysis of bulk sediment samples revealed overall high concentrations of carbon an d nitrogen across most intervals, with variations being related to the lithologic changes. Th e TOC/TN ratios, an indicator of the relative contribution of marine and terrestrial sources of carbon, show inflection points and trends that appear to coincide with some global-scale changes i n climate and ocean conditions. Peaks in $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ abundance correlate to high total carbon (TC) an d are likely indicators of authigenic carbonate minerals in the sediment. TOC ranges between 0. 5 and $1.5\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ and generally shows an inverse relationship to the alkalinity of the IW, suggesting tha t the changes in TOC may be closely related to methanogenesis accompanied by the decompositio n of organic matter. The SMTZ at Site U1620 is near the sediment/water interface, which i s expected given the high methane supply in the sediment (generally above $5000\,\mathrm{ppm})$ ). Immediatel y below the SMTZ, the methane profile peaks $\langle{\sim}20~\mathrm{mbsf}\rangle$ ) and then decreases $({\sim}80~\mathrm{mbsf})$ an d remains relatively stable before increasing again from 516 mbsf to the bottom of the record. Th e extrapolated temperature of the sediment at this depth implies that the elevated methane levels a t depth are not from an active biological process of methanogenesis, given the thermal limitation s of methanogenic microbes (Katayama et al., 2022). The additional presence of heavier $C_{2}..C_{6}$ hydrocarbons at depth suggests either a thermogenic source (i.e., heating of buried organic matter) or an abiotic source, with the most likely candidate being the serpentinization of ultramafi c basement rocks (Johnson et al., 2015).  

At Site U1620, microbiological sampling for sedaDNA followed the procedures used at Sit e U1618. Low-resolution sampling spanned the Holocene to early Pleistocene. High-resolutio n sampling focused on two intervals tentatively identified by biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, and physical property patterns as interglacials MISs 5e through 11 and 31. In addition, an exploratory sample to test for preservation of the oldest sedaDNA was taken deeper in the core record.  

# 4.3.3.8. Downhole logging  

Borehole logging data suffered from noises caused by alternately swelling and washed-out formations, especially in the uppermost $260~\mathrm{m}$ . The logging natural gamma ray values are lower tha n those from shipboard scanning but show almost the same trends, and core and log depth scale s can be readily correlated. Downhole logging (Hostile Environment Litho-Density Sonde [HLDS] ) density measurements are very similar to densities derived from shipboard GRA core scans an d discrete moisture and density measurements within the intervals with good borehole condition. Accelerator Porosity Sonde (APS) porosity data are extremely limited and show unclear and unstable trends in the available data. No significant downcore trend was observed in electrical resistivity measurements. Borehole temperature measurements made in Holes U1620A, U1620C, an d U1620D show formation temperature at the Svyatogor Ridge increased almost linearly with depth, and the slope of linear regression provides a higher geothermal gradient than typical oceanic sediments compared to the statistical data set (Kolawole and Evenick, 2023).  

# 4.4. Sites U1621–U1623  

# 4.4.1. Background and objectives  

The Bellsund drift drilling sites (Figure F1) are located on a plastered sediment drift that developed along the lower continental slope $1700{-}1800\,\mathrm{m}$ water depth) of the western margin of Svalbard under the influence of the northward-flowing WSC (Rebesco et al., 2013). The Bellsund drif t has built up over millions of years since the opening of the Fram Strait $(17{-}10\,\mathrm{Ma};$ ; Jakobsson et al., 2007; Engen et al., 2008; Ehlers and Jokat, 2013) that determined the onset of the contour curren t circulation system in the area (Eiken and Hinz, 1993; Gebhardt et al., 2014), with development o f sediment drifts covering large areas of the European North Atlantic margin including the Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, western margin of Svalbard, and eastern side of the Fram Strait (Laberg e t al., 2005). The Bellsund drift recorded the continental input associated with the expansion an d retreat of the paleo-SBSIS during the past glacial and interglacial cycles (glacial debris flows an d sediment-laden meltwater plumes) and the variability of the warm WSC through its effect on th e marine biological productivity in the water column (Lucchi et al., 2018; Caricchi et al., 2019; Torricella et al., 2022; Gamboa Sojo et al., 2024). Its location between the Storfjorden TMF to th e south and the Bellsund TMF to the north provided some protection from direct glaciogenic inpu t from the paleo-SBSIS during the past glaciations while still capturing a record of the ice shee t dynamics.  

Piston core work in this area demonstrates that the Bellsund drift is an excellent setting to recove r continuous, expanded, and datable sedimentary sequences for detailed paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic analyses. The 2014 Eurofleets2 PREPARED project (Lucchi et al., 2014) recovere d a long Calypso piston core from the Bellsund drift that contains a continuous, very expande d paleoclimatic record spanning the last $40~\mathrm{ky}$ with up to subcentennial resolution. A robust ag e model was defined through paleomagnetic and biostratigraphic analyses, the identification o f tephras, and radiocarbon dating of the abundant biogenic carbonate fraction (Caricchi et al., 2019, 2020). The sedimentological analyses indicated the consistent presence of contouritic depositio n and the existence of short-lived, abrupt depositional events associated with prominent meltwate r events, including the MWP-1A (Lucchi et al., 2013, 2015), the MWP-19ka (Caricchi et al., 2019), and Heinrich-like events indicating a highly dynamic paleo-SBSIS during the last 60 ky (Lucchi e t al., 2018; Caricchi et al., 2019).  

The drill sites on the Bellsund drift are designed to recover an expanded sedimentary sequence t o specifically examine suborbital oscillations of the last $100\;\mathrm{ky},$ , the MBE $(\sim\!400\,\mathrm{ka})$ , the MPT $({\sim}1.2-$ $0.7\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ), and the primary establishment of shelf edge glaciation in this area at about $1.3\,\mathrm{Ma}$ corresponding to Seismic Reflector R4A (Rebesco et al., 2014b). Site U1621 (proposed Site BED-01A; Lucchi et al., 2023) was chosen because seismic profiles indicate a highly expanded sedimen t record down to Seismic Reflector R3 $({\sim}0.75\mathrm{\Ma};$ Figure F15A), with sedimentation rates potentially exceeding $300~\mathrm{m/My}$ . Three holes were drilled at Site U1621 down to Seismic Reflector R 3 $({\sim}225~\mathrm{mbsf})$ . Due to a discrepancy in coordinates transcription, Site U1622 was drilled into th e Storfjorden TMF (Figure F15B) ${\sim}8~\mathrm{km}$ from the intended location. Site U1623 (proposed Sit e BED-02B; Lucchi et al., 2023) was located ${\sim}4.4~\mathrm{km}$ downslope from Site U1621 to drill a longe r record down to Seismic Reflector R4A $_{\sim1.3\,\mathrm{Ma}}$ ; $\mathord{\sim}347$ mbsf; Figure F15A). Seven holes (U1623A– U1623G) were drilled at Site U1623 (Figure F5) with a maximum drill depth of 370 mbsf. Wate r depths at all three sites were between 1647 and $1708\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

At Sites U1621 and U1623, the main initial objectives were to recover complete and overlappin g stratigraphic sequences extending from the present down to Seismic Reflectors R3 $({\sim}0.75\,\mathrm{Ma})$ an d R4A $({\sim}1.3\,\mathrm{Ma})$ , respectively. Such a recovery would support the following research goals:  

• Reconstruction of a high-resolution sediment stratigraphy since the onset of Pleistocene shelf edge glaciation;   
• Study of ocean–cryosphere interactions and forcing mechanisms on the paleo–ice sheet dynamics; and   
• Investigation of the influence of the WSC variability through time on the ice coverage, climate, and microbial populations and to what extent this is still affecting contemporary geochemical fluxes.  

In addition, Site U1622 offers a unique opportunity for research on a sedimentary package recovered directly from the nearby TMF.  

# 4.4.2. Operations  

Operations for coring the Bellsund drift sites occurred over two time windows. Sites U1621 an d U1622 and Holes U1623A–U1623C were drilled between 12 and 17 July 2024 (Table T1; Figur e F5). Later, after completion of coring at Isfjorden drift (Site U1624), we returned to Site U1623 an d drilled Holes U1623D–U1623G. This second period of Bellsund drift coring operations took plac e between 21 and 25 July. Fortunately, $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratios consistently plotted in (or near) the normal rang e at all three sites (Figure F7). Gas expansion still occurred while coring some intervals, and it wa s standard practice to relieve gas pressure by drilling holes in the core liner when voids wer e observed. As formation characteristics changed at Sites U1621 and U1623, deployment of th e APC and HLAPC systems shifted to the XCB drilling system, with advances by $_{6-8\textrm{m}}$ to allow fo r gas expansion of the sediments in the core liner. To minimize magnetic overprinting on the core d sediment, the nonmagnetic collars and core barrels were used for all APC/HLAPC operations a t all three sites.  

Three holes (U1621A–U1621C) were drilled at Site U1621 over 4 days; these are ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{~m~}$ apar t along Seismic Line SV15-04. Although approved to drill to 397 mbsf, the highest priority was t o recover an expanded late Pleistocene sequence, which would be accomplished by reaching Seismi c Reflector R3, a suspected gravelly formation. This goal was met at all three holes, penetrating to  a maximum depth of 216.1 mbsf and providing a combined cored interval of $517.3\,\mathrm{m}$ . At Site U1621, a total of 89 cores were retrieved: 40 APC $(45\%)$ , 21 HLAPC $(24\%)$ , and $28\;\mathrm{XCB}$ $(31\%)$ . In Hol e U1621A, Cores 1H–28X penetrated from the seafloor to 215.3 mbsf with a recovery of $84\%$ . Formation temperatures were measured using the APCT-3 tool on Cores 4H, 7H, and 10H. In Hol e U1621B, Cores 1H–33X penetrated from the seafloor to 216.1 mbsf with a recovery of $94\%$ . In Hole U1621C, Cores 1H–28X penetrated from the seafloor to 207.9 mbsf with a recovery of $94\%$ .  

Site U1622 is a single hole (U1622A) that was drilled in half a day. During coring operations, it wa s discovered that the coordinates provided in the Scientific Prospectus (Lucchi et al., 2023) were no t the location of the approved shotpoint for proposed Site BED-02B. Upon discovery of the mismatch of shotpoint and coordinates, coring was terminated, with a maximum penetration of 46. 5 mbsf $99\%$ recovery). The correct shotpoint coordinates were calculated, and we moved to tha t location, which was sufficiently distant from Site U1622 to deem it a new site (U1623). At Sit e U1622, a total of seven cores were retrieved: six APC $(86\%)$ and one HLAPC $(14\%)$ .

B. Seismic profile along northwest–southeast Seismic Line CAGE21-1HH-0 3 showing the projected locations of Sites U1623 and U1622 (penetration $=46.5$ mbsf).  

Seven holes (U1623A–U1623G) were drilled at Site U1623 over 10 nonconsecutive days. Hol e U1623A is located on Seismic Line CAGE21-1-HH-05 (Figure F15), and all other holes are locate d within a $30\times60\:\mathrm{m}$ area to the northeast. The target depth of ${\sim}370$ mbsf (below Seismic Reflecto r R4A) was met in Holes U1623A, U1623C, and U1623D. Holes U1623B and U1623E were poo r mudlines and were abandoned after one core each. Hole U1623F reached a maximum penetratio n of 162.2 mbsf; however, the deepest ${\sim}71\mathrm{~m~}$ (Cores 11H–22F) are suspect because evidence fro m coring operations (no weight on bit), observations from physical properties (extremely low GR A density), visual observation of the sediments through the plastic liner (mousse-like sediments i n absence of gas pressure), and gas analyses (normal gas composition) strongly suggested that th e drilling bit sidetracked into a nearby hole. When the cores from this interval were later split, the y displayed mousse-like core disturbance, which supports this conclusion. Hole U1623G was drille d during the remaining time available. Overall, at Site U1623 a total of 205 cores were retrieved: 5 8 APC $(29\%)$ , 62 HLAPC $(30\%)$ , and 85 XCB $(41\%)$ . The combined cored interval of all Site U162 3 holes (U1623A–U1623G) was $1422.4\mathrm{~m~}$ . Summaries of Holes U1623A, U1623C, U1623D, an d U1623G, which were the most complete and undisturbed, are provided below.  

Hole U1623A (Cores 1H–51X) penetrated from the seafloor to 269.3 mbsf with a recovery of $90\%$ . Formation temperatures were taken on Cores 4H, 7H, and 10H using the APCT-3 tool. Hol e U1623C (Cores 1H–55X) penetrated from the seafloor to 369 mbsf with a recovery of $87\%$ . Following coring, logging was attempted in Hole U1623C; however, the tool string encountere d obstructions in the pipe and later the bit, and logging was terminated. Hole U1623D (Cores 1H– 56X) penetrated from the seafloor to 370 mbsf with a recovery of $95\%$ . Logging in Hole U1623 D was successful, with complete runs of the triple combo tool string and partial runs with the FMSsonic tool. Because of a technical issue, the APS was not deployed. Hole U1623G (Cores 1H–19F ) penetrated from the seafloor to 142.1 mbsf with a recovery of $108\%$ . With much gratitude to th e R/V JOIDES Resolution crew, and under the applause of all JOIDES Resolution Science Operato r staff and scientists, the final core of JOIDES Resolution under IODP was on deck at $1220\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 5 July 2024.  

# 4.4.3. Principal results  

Sites U1621 and U1623 are companion records from the Bellsund drift. Although the distanc e $({\sim}4.4~\mathrm{km})$ between these two site locations is sufficiently far to require designation as separat e IODP sites, their sedimentological, paleontological, paleomagnetic, and geochemical characteristics are very similar in their overlapping stratigraphic sequences, justifying their designation as  a set of sites. For this reason, their principal results are summarized together. Site U1622 is from  a different depositional setting because it was drilled into the nearby Storfjorden TMF and not int o a sediment drift, but its proximity $(\sim\!8\,\mathrm{km})$ to the two Bellsund drift sites, as well as its comparabl e lithology and time period, justifies its inclusion in this grouped summary.  

# 4.4.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Sediments at the two Bellsund drift sites are mainly siliciclastic and primarily composed of dar k gray to greenish gray silty clay, with coarser intervals containing reddish gray to dark reddish gra y sandy mud and diamictons (Figure F9). Clast abundance is variable but generally displays a n increase downhole, with diamictons more common below ${\sim}170$ mbsf at upslope Site U1621 an d below ${\sim}270$ mbsf at downslope Site U1623. In comparison to the northern sites (U1618–U1620), the Bellsund drift and TMF sites are uniquely characterized by the frequent occurrences of smal l patches of fine sand recovered along the entire sequence cored at Site U1621 and in the correlativ e upper unit of Site U1623 (above ${\sim}190~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ) (Figure F8A). These sandy patches are mostly lighte r in color and coarser-grained than the surrounding sediment and are likely to be iceberg-rafte d sediment pellets (Goldschmidt et al., 1992), although further investigation is warranted. Interval s containing light-colored silty or sandy laminations sometimes also occur within this stratigraphi c unit of both Bellsund drift sites, whereas heavily bioturbated sediment distinctly characterizes th e deeper stratigraphic sequence at Site U1623 between $\mathord{\sim}190$ and ${\sim}270$ mbsf. Below 270 mbsf, th e bioturbation is not apparent to slight and there is a greater occurrence of very large clasts (i.e., dropstones), consistent with the increased presence of diamictons at depth.  

Given that Site U1622 is located on the TMF, the lithology is somewhat different than the tw o Bellsund drift sites (U1621 and U1623). The uppermost $5\;\mathrm{m}$ of Site U1622 are primarily silty cla y and include a small interval of nannofossil ooze. Sandy mud with common clasts characterize th e Site U1622 sediments from 5 mbsf to the base of the drilled sequence (46 mbsf).  

# 4.4.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

The most continuous and abundant representation of all microfossil groups (Figure F10) for th e Expedition 403 sites was at Bellsund drift Sites U1621 and U1623. Shipboard sample analysi s mainly focused on core catchers, supposed warm water intervals based on lithologic and physica l properties. One or more microfossil groups were present at levels that enabled documentation o f glacial–interglacial variability for most of the records. Calcareous nannofossils are generally present with good to moderate preservation; they are low in diversity but have frequent to commo n abundances along the studied sequences and alternate with barren intervals (presumed glacia l conditions) and in the lowermost part of the record. A generally well preserved low-diversit y assemblage of planktonic foraminifera is found continuously in the upper part of both sites; foraminifera become more poorly preserved downhole to a point where samples are barren. Divers e and well-preserved diatoms assemblages are present in high abundance in the uppermost part o f the record and in some intervals of the lower record but are otherwise nearly barren at these site s too. Most samples, especially those from targeted interglacials, contain abundant dinocysts o f low-diversity assemblages, although barren intervals exist. Reworked microfossils from olde r stratigraphic levels are intermittently present in the sequences.  

Initial paleoenvironmental assessment based on the microfossil assemblages suggests a Pleistocene paleoenvironment dominated by nutrient-rich, cool Arctic to polar surface water condition s with seasonal sea ice cover, alternating with cool-temperate Atlantic surface water conditions wit h seasonal sea ice.  

Age-diagnostic markers are present for MISs 1, 5, and 7–13 and older warm interglacial periods. Shipboard biostratigraphic data indicate that the Site U1621 stratigraphy ranges in age from a t least ${\sim}0.5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ to the Holocene and that the Site U1623 stratigraphy above the basal diamicto n ranges in age from mid- to late Pleistocene to the Holocene. Calcareous nannofossil content in th e bioturbated silty clay sediments at the bottom of the section could indicate Pleistocene age moderately older than $1.14\,M{\bf a}$ . The diamicton-rich Site U1622 lithology does not favor biostratigraphi c investigation; however, calcareous nannofossils marking an interval younger than MIS 5 wer e present in the uppermost part of the record, and reworked planktonic foraminifera (ages ${<}1.7\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ) are also present in the record.  

# 4.4.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

The paleomagnetic records of sediments at Sites U1621 and U1623 are not as complicated b y authigenic mineral magnetic overprints as those at Sites U1618–U1620. The uppermost $90{-}100\,\mathrm{m}$ at the Bellsund drift sites have a magnetic mineral assemblage consistent with detrital magneti c mineral (Figure F11). Below this depth, Fe-sulfide precipitants were sometimes present, causin g higher MS intervals. This complication was managed by using the same effective methods fro m earlier drilled sites to filter the archive-half NRM data for intervals with lower MS and by augmenting routine NRM analyses with carefully selected discrete cube samples. The magnetic stratigraphy for Site U1621 indicates that the sediments were deposited during Chron C1n (Brunhes), with a maximum age limit of $0.773\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . At Site U1623, the base of Chron C1n and the top and bas e of Subchron C1r.1n (Jaramillo; $0.99–1.07\;\mathrm{Ma})$ were identified. The base of recovery at Site U162 3 is between 1070 and $1775\;\mathrm{ka}$ , younger than Subchron C2n (Olduvai). The well-resolved magnetizations, magnetic mineral assemblages, and success in coring multiple holes with limited corin g disturbance indicate great potential for generating a longer high-resolution paleomagnetic reconstruction at both Bellsund drift sites for at least the uppermost $90{-}100\mathrm{~m}$ . No paleomagneti c reversals were identified in the $46\;\mathrm{m}$ Site U1622 record, and it is assumed to be deposited durin g Chron C1n (Brunhes).  

# 4.4.3.4. Age model  

Because the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary is not identified at Site U1621 and the shipboard biostratigraphic age control markers are poorly constrained at depth, it is premature to report sedimentation rate estimates for the interval below $\mathord{\sim}74$ mbsf at Site U1621. However, sedimentatio n rates in the uppermost ${\sim}74~\mathrm{m}$ ${\sqrt{\sim0.3\;\mathrm{Ma})}}$ of Site U1621 are approximately $245\;\mathrm{m}$ /My (Figure F12).  

A more complete preliminary age model based on both biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraph y is available for Site U1623. Here, sedimentation rates are approximately $193\;\mathrm{m},$ /My over the sam e time interval, confirming the preexpedition interpretation based on seismic data that Site U162 1 contained a more expanded late Pleistocene record than Site U1623. Taking a longer view, sedimentation rates over the last $^{\sim1}$ My average approximately $201\;\mathrm{m/My}$ at Site U1623.  

Between the base of the record and ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , there are discrepancies in the different age contro l datums but the datums suggest sedimentation rates were high (somewhere between 264 and 92 4 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{M}\mathbf{y})$ . Though widely ranging, these data point to decreased sedimentation rates after ${\sim}1\,M\mathbf{a}$ , a n observation also made at Sites U1618–U1620 and regionally at several ODP sites (908, 909, an d 911; Myhre et al., 1995; Thiede and Myhre, 1996). As noted earlier, this timing is concurrent wit h the climate reorganization of the MPT.  

No age model was developed for Site U1622.  

# 4.4.3.5. Physical properties  

The physical property measurements at the two Bellsund drift sites display clear cyclic variabilitie s over the lengths of their records. Generally, NGR tracks GRA bulk density trends downcore, wit h some exceptions in the deeper portions of Hole U1621B, likely related to an increased occurrenc e of diamictons near the base of this hole, interpreted as Seismic Reflector R3. Higher overall NG R values at Site U1623 compared to Site U1621 may be associated with higher clay content farthe r from the shelf edge. Some high MS values are present in the Bellsund drift sediment records bu t are less pervasive than those observed at Sites U1618–U1620; this is consistent with fewer Fesulfide minerals observed at depth on the split core surfaces or in X-radiographs at the Bellsun d drift sites. Because the Bellsund drift sites are less affected by secondary alteration, there are mor e apparent similarities between MS and other physical properties (e.g., NGR), recording the detrita l input signals.  

Unlike the two Bellsund drift sites, GRA bulk density at Site U1622 displays a sharp increase at  5 mbsf that remains high to the base of the record. This observation is consistent with the clast-ric h sandy mud–dominated lithology. Higher NGR at Site U1622 compared to Sites U1621 and U162 3 likely results from the lithology of this glaciogenic sequence and its low porosity. Together, th e geographic setting, lithology, and physical property data suggest that Site U1622 is a sedimentar y package of debris flows and/or other glacial mass transport deposits (MTDs). Motivated by th e recovery of this MTD, an ASR experiment was set up using cores from nearby Site U1623 to stud y the stress that MTD emplaced at Site U1622 may have had on preexisting slope deposits at Sit e U1623. In addition, a new component to the ASR experiment was incorporated at Site U1623: headspace gas measurements of the ASR samples became part of the experimental protocol t o evaluate if sediment degassing is a plausible explanation for the shrinkage noted in the strain gaug e finding from experiments already underway for Sites U1618 and U1620.  

# 4.4.3.6. Stratigraphic correlation  

Stratigraphic correlation for Sites U1621 and U1623 was primarily accomplished using MS. Core s from all three Site U1621 holes were used to construct the splice, with Hole U1621B serving as th e backbone. Most coring gaps were covered with this approach, producing a splice from 0 to $\mathord{\sim}188\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF. The offset between CSF and CCSF depth scales is nearly linear; below 60 mbsf, the growt h factor is a little higher because of gas expansion. For U1623, both a primary and an alternativ e splice were generated. The primary splice for Site U1623 based on cores from Holes U1623A, U1623C, U1623D, and U1623F is complete for the entire $404~\mathrm{m}$ record, with only one small gap. The alternative splice is from 0 to $174\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF}.$ In construction of the alternative splice, cores fro m Hole U1623G were used as the backbone; gaps in the uppermost $90\textrm{m}$ were filled in with core s from Hole U1623F, and most gaps below this depth could be filled in with cores from Hole s U1623A, U1623D, and U1623G. The Site U1623 cores have similar, nearly linear growth rates, although differences exist between the holes and increase below $\mathord{\sim}150~\mathrm{mbsf}.$ . For all three splice s (one for Site U1621 and the primary and alternative splices for Site U1623), calculations of mas s accumulation rates based on their CCSF scales should account for the expansion by dividin g apparent depth intervals by the appropriate growth factor. No correlation or splice was require d for Site U1622, as it was a single hole to only 46 mbsf.  

# 4.4.3.7. Geochemistry  

Sediment organic geochemistry at the two Bellsund drift sites display cyclic variations in $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3},$ TOC, and TN over the uppermost ${\sim}190{-}200\ \mathrm{m}$ . Given the preliminary sedimentation rates an d the prevalence of microfossil groups in the Site U1621 and U1623 records, these results sugges t possible orbital pacing of marine productivity and/or their dilution by terrestrial input over th e last 1 My. Intervals of increased TOC/TN ratios generally correlate to low $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ abundances; these results tentatively point to TOC/TN ratios marking times of intense glaciogenic erosion an d transport to the marine environment. Below $\mathord{\sim}200$ mbsf, the overall $C a C O_{3}$ abundances decreas e and Ca in the IW increases; both are consistent with increases in barren intervals of calcareou s microfossils with depth. Site U1622 is low in $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ but high in TOC and has the highes t TOC/TN ratios of all Expedition 403 sites; these results all support the interpretation that Sit e U1622 is a record of MTDs in the form of clast-rich glaciogenic debris flows, which delivered ver y large amounts of terrigenous sediment, building up glacial TMF in the marine environment on th e continental margin.  

The headspace gas measurements at the Bellsund drift sites remained in the normal zone (a welcome change after drilling the Vestnesa and Svyatogor Ridge locations) (Figure F7). Althoug h methane concentrations increased moving below the seawater interface through a shallow SMT Z at Sites U1621 and U1623, they remained steady at ${\sim}10\small{,}000$ ppm to the base of the records. Ethan e $\mathrm{{{C}_{2}}}$ hydrocarbon gas) concentrations at Site U1623 showed some relationship to lithology, becoming more concentrated with depth, suggesting some lithologic influence on gas formation and/o r migration. Some elements in the Site U1623 IW, including Fe and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ as well as IW alkalinity, also display downcore changes in concentrations that show some relationship to lithology.  

At Sites U1621 and U1623, microbiological sampling for sedaDNA followed the procedure s described previously. These sites provided the best chronological control for high-resolution sampling during the expedition. Sampling focused on collecting sedaDNA records of targeted, expanded intervals at Site U1621, including the period of paleo-SBSIS advance and retreat fro m ${\sim}30$ ka to present day and interglacial stage MIS 5e. Interglacial MIS 11 was targeted for samplin g in the deeper record from Site U1623. Postexpedition sedaDNA analyses will primarily investigat e the polar marine ecosystem responses to past warming.  

# 4.4.3.8. Downhole logging  

Downhole logging was performed in Hole U1623D using the triple combo and FMS-sonic too l strings to obtain multiple in situ property measurements. The natural gamma ray and HLDS measurements show trends similar to shipboard scanning data with an average density of $1.84\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ i n the interval $105.1{-}239.0\;\mathrm{m}$ wireline log matched depth below seafloor (WMSF) (below the pipeline).  

Borehole diameter variations affect some of the logging results for Hole U1623. Nevertheless, natural gamma ray and density show almost the same trends observed in the shipboard scanning dat a between ${\sim}105$ and 239 mbsf, with some cyclic variability. Lower amplitude fluctuations of bot h parameters were observed between 105 and $\mathord{\sim}160$ mbsf, likely related to poor borehole condition s and potential gas presence. Electricity resistivity logs indicate some intervals that may have larg e pore spaces and high water content. $P$ -wave acoustic velocity data show cyclic changes mimickin g that observed in other logging data. This was one of only two sites (U1618 and U1623) for whic h borehole resistivity images were acquired. Borehole temperature measurements were made i n Holes U1621A and U1623A; these data show formation temperature in the Bellsund drift increasing almost linearly with depth. The slope of the linear regression provides geothermal gradient s typical for oceanic sediments (Kolawole and Evenick, 2023).  

# 4.5. Site U1624  

# 4.5.1. Background and objectives  

The Isfjorden drift drill site is located on the slope proximal area ${\sqrt{\frac{}{}{\sim}1320\mathrm{~m~}}}$ water depth; Figure s F1, F3) of a plastered sediment drift that developed along the western continental margin of Svalbard under the influence of the northward-flowing WSC (Rebesco et al., 2013). The Isfjorden drif t has built up over millions of years since the opening of the Fram Strait $(17{-}10\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) (Jakobsson e t al., 2007; Engen et al., 2008; Ehlers and Jokat, 2013). The opening determined the onset of th e contour current circulation system in the area (Eiken and Hinz, 1993; Gebhardt et al., 2014), wit h development of sediment drifts covering large areas of the European North Atlantic margin, including the Norwegian and Barents Seas, western margin of Svalbard, and eastern side of th e Fram Strait (Laberg et al., 2005). Sediment drifts are depocenters developing under persistent bottom currents that substantially rework the sediments delivered to the marine environmen t through terrestrial and marine processes (Stow et al., 2002; Rebesco, 2014a). In addition to sediments, the bottom currents transport oxygen and nutrients, generating ideal environmenta l conditions for the biological productivity with sediments rich in carbonate biogenic fraction i f postmortem diagenetic conditions allow for their preservation.  

A previous ODP Leg 162 drill site (986; Jansen and Raymo, 1996) was located in the deeper, dista l slope facing the Isfjorden drift to examine the onset of glaciation in the European Arctic and establish the history of the paleo-SBSIS. Site 986 recovered a sequence of ${\sim}2.4$ My primarily consistin g of fine- to coarse-grained siliciclastic sediments with varying amounts of gravel interpreted as IR D and considered to represent the depositional record after the onset of NHG. The sequence contains a main shift in the glacial style with an increased volume of debris flow sedimentation relate d with the onset of shelf edge glaciations in the western margin of Svalbard (Raymo et al., 1999 ) considered to correspond to Seismic Reflector R4A, dating ${\sim}1.3$ My (Rebesco et al., 2014b).  

The Isfjorden drift drill Site U1624 (proposed Site ISD-01C; Lucchi et al., 2023) was specificall y designed to recover an expanded sedimentary sequence in a slope proximal area to reconstruct th e dynamic of the paleo-SBSIS under past oceanographic and climatic forcing after the onset of shel f edge glaciations. Because of its close location to the continental shelf break and former ice shee t terminus during glacial maximum, the Isfjorden drift contains most of the meltwater events associated with the paleo–ice sheet decay deriving from ocean and climate forcing. Located betwee n the Bellsund TMF to the south and the Isfjorden TMF to the north, the Isfjorden drift was partiall y shielded from the massive glaciogenic input building TMFs, allowing also for a partial preservation of the interglacial contouritic sedimentation that can provide biostratigraphic and paleoceanographic constraints.  

Piston cores collected in this area demonstrate that in addition to the proximal location, th e Isfjorden drift is a good setting to recover continuous, relatively expanded, and datable sedimentary sequences. The 2014 Eurofleets2-PREPARED project (Lucchi et al., 2014) recovered a lon g Calypso piston core containing a continuous, submillennial paleoclimatic record spanning the las t $60\,\mathrm{\ky.}$ . A robust age model was defined through paleomagnetic and biostratigraphic analyse s together with radiocarbon dating of the biogenic carbonate fraction collected from the interglacia l intervals of contouritic sedimentation (Caricchi et al., 2019, 2020). The sedimentological analyse s indicated the presence of glacial debris flows, recording shelf edge glaciations and an extensiv e record of plumites, indicating ice sheet melting that appears well developed at the site (Caricchi e t al., 2019).  

Located close to the Bellsund drift, drilling at Isfjorden drift Site U1624 aimed to provide complementary information on the WSC characteristics and variability allowing discrimination betwee n climate-driven events related to local or regional effects. Site U1624 was drilled to a maximu m depth of 258 mbsf at a $1320\ \mathrm{m}$ water depth. Drilling targeted a stratigraphic sequence extendin g from the present down to Seismic Reflector R4A $({\sim}1.3\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . Such a recovery would support th e following research goals:  

• Stratigraphic reconstruction of the paleo-SBSIS dynamics since the onset of Pleistocene shelf edge glaciation;   
• Study of ocean–cryosphere interactions and forcing mechanisms on the paleo–ice sheet dynamics; and   
• Identification of tipping points between the late stages of glaciations and the onset of glacial terminations.  

# 4.5.2. Operations  

Operations commenced at Site U1624 on 18 July 2024. During the 3.23 days on site, three hole s were drilled (U1624A–U1624C), two of which had substantial core recovery (Figure F5; Table T1). Hole U1624A is located on Seismic Line CAGE20-5HH-13, and all three holes are located jus t southeast of Seismic Line EG-01A (Figure F16). The mudline was poorly recovered in Hol e U1624A; therefore, it was abandoned. Holes U1624B and U1624C both reached the target depth. The combined cored interval from all three holes was $517.3~\mathrm{m}$ . As the most proximal site of th e expedition to the Svalbard shelf edge, drilling encountered more coarse sediment deposits than a t other sites, hampering core recovery in some intervals. Thus, although some cores had ${>}100\%$ recovery due to gas expansion in mud-rich intervals, recovery was low for a few cores with coarse r sediments. Because formation characteristics changed at each hole, deployment of the APC system shifted to the HLAPC system and ultimately to the XCB drilling system at different depths. A t Site U1624, a total of 89 cores were recovered: 22 APC $(25\%)$ , 24 HLAPC $(27\%)$ , and 43 XCB $(48\%)$ . To minimize magnetic overprinting on the cored sediment, the nonmagnetic collars and core barrels were used for all APC and HLAPC coring. To mitigate for gas pressure and expansion, hole s were drilled into the liners and most XCB cores were advanced by $_{6-8\textrm{m}}$ .  

One $1.3\,\mathrm{m}$ long core was recovered from Hole U1624A; however, because it was extruded from th e liner by water pressure onto the rig floor, the mudline was uncertain and the hole was terminated. Hole U1624B was drilled $5~\mathrm{m}$ east at a $1320\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth. Cores 1H–45X penetrated from th e seafloor to 258 mbsf with a recovery of $86\%$ . Formation temperature measurements were taken o n Cores 4H, 7H, $10\mathrm{H}$ , and 14F using the APCT-3 tool. In total, we spent 1.5 days on Hole U1624B. Hole U1624C was located $20\;\mathrm{m}$ southwest of Hole U1624B. It was spudded on 20 July at a wate r depth of $1320\;\mathrm{m}$ . Cores 1H–43X penetrated from the seafloor to 258 mbsf with a recovery of $93\%$ . In total, we spent 1.5 days on Hole U1624C. Given the short drill depth, downhole logging was no t performed at Site U1624.  

# 4.5.3. Principal results  

# 4.5.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The Isfjorden sediment drift record at Site U1624 is siliciclastic and coarsens with depth. In Hole s U1624B and U1624C, the lithology in the uppermost ${\sim}86\mathrm{~m~}$ is primarily dark gray silty clays wit h occasional reddish gray sandy mud (Figures F8A, F9). Clast abundance is variable but generall y increases downcore, and below ${\sim}202$ mbsf the sediment is almost entirely diamicton, with a fe w interbedded intervals of sandy mud. In general, laminated intervals are occasionally present in th e uppermost ${\sim}120{-}150\ \mathrm{m}$ of Site U1624. Dark patches are most prevalent over this same dept h range, as are the occurrence of thin layers of sand and/or silt interbedded within the silty clay a s well as small light patches of fine quartz sand, which are hypothesized to be ice-rafted sedimen t pellets (Goldschmidt et al., 1992). In the uppermost ${\sim}202\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , long intervals with slight to moderat e bioturbation alternate with intervals showing no apparent bioturbation.

# 4.5.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossils, diatoms, dinocysts, and planktonic foraminifera are present in limite d amounts at Site U1624 (Figure F10); the highest abundances were generally observed in sample s from silty clay intervals in the upper portion of the cored sediment record. The representation o f calcareous nannofossils is scarce overall and barren toward the base of the record. When present, diversity is low and the concentration of calcareous nannofossil specimens ranges between rar e and common. With the exception of a few fragments observed in deeper samples, diatoms are onl y found at the very top of the record (Core 1H from both holes), where abundance is rare and preservation is moderate. Intervals with rare to abundant concentrations of dinocysts are present t o the base of the record but alternate with barren intervals. Often the dinocyst diversity is low, although some samples contain rich warm-water assemblages. Planktonic foraminifera are present in the upper part of the record, ranging from rare to abundant; their diversity is generally low. Preservation decreases with depth, and samples are barren of foraminifera below ${\sim}178$ mbsf. Reworked dinocysts and terrestrial palynomorphs are sometimes present in the Site U162 4 record. Interestingly, notwithstanding the proximal location of Site U1624 to the continental shelf, the presence of reworked nannofossils from older deposits is very limited in the sedimentar y sequence.  

Calcareous nannofossils and foraminifera provide five age-diagnostic Pleistocene biostratigraphi c markers for Site U1624. Additional age-diagnostic microfossils of MISs 5 and 7–13 and olde r interglacials were also identified. Initial paleoenvironmental assessment based on the microfossi l assemblage suggests Pleistocene Arctic to polar surface water conditions with seasonal sea ic e cover and intermittent intervals with a relatively warm Atlantic water influence.  

# 4.5.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

The magnetic mineral assemblage at Site U1624 is similar to that at the Bellsund drift sites (U162 1 and U1623). There were no high MS peaks, and the ARM coercivity was low (but still bimodal), suggesting the Site U1624 magnetic minerals contain a strong detrital signature (Figure F11). As  a result, demagnetization of the archive-half sections and vertically oriented discrete cube sample s was fairly straightforward. The bimodal distribution of the $\mathrm{ARM}_{30\mathrm{mT}}/\mathrm{ARM}$ ratio warrants furthe r investigation. The Site U1624 diamictons and other clast-rich intervals presented a different challenge for reconstructing the magnetic stratigraphy because these XCB-cored intervals likely d o not preserve their original sedimentary fabric and rarely recovered intact biscuits. Targeting discrete cube sampling of intact biscuits from fine-grained sediments interbedded with the diamictons shows some promise for refining the magnetic stratigraphy. X-ray image analysis is useful fo r identifying suitably intact biscuits. Based on the Site U1624 shipboard paleomagnetic work, th e onset of Chron C1n (the Matuyama/Brunhes boundary; $0.773\;\mathrm{Ma}_{\phantom{2}}$ ) must have occurred betwee n $\mathord{\sim}154$ and 174 mbsf, and the base of the recovered sediments must be older than $0.773\;\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

# 4.5.3.4. Age model  

The preliminary age model for Site U1624 is based on biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraph y (Figure F12). Linear sedimentation rates over the entire cored sequence are estimated to b e approximately $212~\mathrm{m/My},$ , which falls within the range of those estimated for the Bellsund drif t sites. Postexpedition research will refine the Site U1624 age model.  

# 4.5.3.5. Physical properties  

At Site U1624, NGR and GRA bulk density generally show a positive linear correlation, and th e mean values of both properties increase with depth. The MS values at Site U1624 are lower than a t previous sites, and the MS signal at Site U1624 appears largely driven by variations in detrita l input. The greatest amplitude variability of MS occurs in the uppermost ${\sim}90\ \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , which is rich i n silty clay. In contrast, below $\mathord{\sim}200$ mbsf, MS values are much lower and occur in association wit h high GRA bulk density; at these depths, diamictons are the dominant lithologies.  

# 4.5.3.6. Stratigraphic correlation  

Stratigraphic correlation for holes at Site U1624 was primarily accomplished using MS. The bes t recovered stratigraphy of Hole U1624C was used as the backbone of the splice. Hole U1624B wa s used to fill most coring gaps down to ${\sim}200\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF. Below this depth, more coring gaps exist, including several that occur in both holes, so the cores were appended based on a consisten t growth factor of 1.065. Gas expansion was greatest between $\mathord{\sim}150$ and 190 mbsf, resulting in large r cumulative offsets between the CSF-A and CCSF scales for this interval and variable growt h factors. Calculation of mass accumulation rates based on the CCSF scale should account for th e expansion by dividing apparent depth intervals by the appropriate growth factor.  

# 4.5.3.7. Geochemistry  

Shipboard geochemistry results from the Site U1624 IW and headspace gas measurements indicate that the SMTZ is likely between ${\sim}4$ and 18 mbsf. A maximum alkalinity value of ${\sim}22\ \mathrm{mM}$ i s likely an indication of bicarbonate production within the SMTZ, and decreased alkalinity wit h depth likely relates to ongoing microbial methanogenesis. A downhole increase of IW Ca and S r suggest that carbonate dissolution is occurring with depth; the increase of Ca in the IW is likely a t the expense of biogenic carbonate microfossils, which are generally barren below $\mathord{\sim}200$ mbsf. I n general, the IW Ca results show an opposite pattern to the sediment geochemistry results o f $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3},$ suggesting that biogenic carbonate variability is primarily controlling the downcor e $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ pattern. However, below $\mathord{\sim}200$ mbsf, both Ca and $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ increase, suggesting that som e authigenic carbonate is precipitating in the sediment at depth, consistent with sedimentologica l observations. Fe, Mn, and Si also all vary with depth, and Fe is completely consumed by ${\sim}93$ mbsf. Overall, Si decreases downhole but shows fluctuations that appear to relate to changes in lithology, with higher concentrations in silty clay and very low concentrations in the diamictons. Th e TOC/TN ratio indicates there were organic matter contributions from marine and terrestria l sources. The stratigraphic variations in the TOC/TN ratio warrant further investigation once  a more robust age model is available. Both ethane and propane showed notable increases belo w $\mathord{\sim}200$ mbsf, which is below the interval from which retrieved cores had the greatest gas expansion.  

# 4.5.3.8. Downhole measurements  

Borehole measurements made while coring Hole U1624B show formation temperature at th e Isfjorden drift increased almost linearly with depth, and the calculated geothermal gradient is typical for oceanic sediments when compared with the statistical data set (Kolawole and Evenick, 2023).  

# 5. Preliminary scientific assessment  

# 5.1. Operational considerations related to the science objectives  

The operational plan for Expedition 403 laid out in the Scientific Prospectus (Lucchi et al., 2023 ) was designed to optimize recovery of expanded depositional sequences from sediment drifts alon g the western margin of Svalbard; as such, we anticipated this would be a high recovery expedition. With $5343\;\mathrm{m}$ of total core and an average recovery of $95\%$ , this goal was met (Table T1). The AP C coring system was used as much as possible, producing cores with minimal drilling disturbance. Use of the HLAPC system and coring by advancement with the XCB system were also both helpfu l as a means of recovering the best-quality cores for the formation conditions, including sometime s getting through challenging glaciogenic gravel-rich layers.  

The operational goal of drilling each of the six primary sites identified in the Scientific Prospectu s was also accomplished. As a result, the recovered core records span the intended geographi c extent, including a south–north transect within the modern flow direction of the WSC and east– west transects that span proximal to distal settings relative to the Svalbard continental margi n (Figure F1). Planning also recognized the need for multiple, correlatable records, especially of th e younger time intervals, to meet expected high-resolution sampling demands. Except for one location (Site U1619), this goal was met by drilling at least two holes at each site (Figure F5). At the tw o Bellsund drift sites, this operational success was amplified by drilling three good recovery holes o f a highly expanded sequence at Site U1621 and five good recovery (and deeper) holes at nearby Sit e U1623. Additionally, planning aimed to drill at least one very deep hole at several sites to provid e long-time series records. This goal was largely met by obtaining ${>}600\ \mathrm{m}$ records from both th e western Vestnesa Ridge (Site U1619) and Svyatogor Ridge (Site U1620) drill sites.  

The operational challenges of the expedition primarily related to sea ice conditions and to th e presence of gas hydrates that occurred as disseminated small pockets in sandy intervals that wer e not detectable through the geophysical survey. Ice navigation proved essential for decision makin g on when to drill the most ice-vulnerable northernmost location, Site U1619. Rather than followin g the initial operational plan to drill sites from south to north (under the assumption that sea ic e conditions would improve later in the summer season), we took advantage of open water conditions in the north at the start of the expedition. Had we not made this adjustment, it is unlikel y coring would have been possible at Site U1619. As it was, we were only able to stay on site for 5. 2 days before the sea ice margin approached within $5\ \mathrm{nmi}$ , terminating Hole U1619A. Although  a free fall funnel was deployed in hopes of returning to continue coring to the target depth (73 8 mbsf) and drilling additional holes for coring and logging, the sea ice conditions never improved; the site remained either at the sea ice margin or within the consolidated sea ice zone for th e remaining time of the expedition.  

The presence of gas hydrates and related free gas was more of a challenge than expected at severa l sediment drift locations, especially Vestnesa Ridge East (Site U1618) and Svyatogor Ridge (Sit e U1620). Although Site U1618 was located in an attempt to avoid gas chimneys and faults that ca n serve as conduits for fluid migration and was at least $2~\mathrm{km}$ away from a regional gas hydrate– related BSR, chemical and physical evidence of gas (including apparent dissociated gas hydrates ) was present. Similar conditions also existed at Site U1620. As a consequence, coring operation s were often slower than planned and several holes did not reach their target depth. Vigilant safet y monitoring and mitigation were needed. Additional borehole temperatures were taken to determine the geothermal gradient, and hydrocarbon gas levels were continuously monitored. Operations frequently paused between each core run as we waited for results from the headspace ga s samples taken from the previous core, which informed decisions on whether coring could continue. Results indicated that coring operations were commonly occurring near or in the hydrocarbon anomalous zone at these two sites (Figure F7), and each hole had to be terminate d prematurely for anomalous $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratios and/or for increased presence of higher (e.g., $C_{5}$ and $C_{6}$ ) hydrocarbons. The gas hazards also posed risks to those handling core on the rig floor and on th e core receiving platform because gas pressure caused liners to shatter (and sometimes explode), necessitating that several mitigation steps were taken, including drilling holes in the core liner s and using Kevlar blankets when handling core. The scientific team is grateful to the drilling platform crew and technicians for working under these challenging conditions.  

Logging operations were affected by some technical challenges, in addition to the unpredictabl e nature of the borehole conditions. The primary challenges that affected logging-related progres s toward the scientific objectives was the inoperability of the VSI tool for the entire expedition an d the inability to use the FMS-sonic tool string at Site U1620. Data collection from the VSI tool wa s intended to provide groundtruthing data for regional seismic interpretations. Data from the FMSsonic tool was intended to support tectonic stress regime research. In addition, the logging pla n was originally designed to collect data at both Sites U1619 and U1620 to understand alternativ e stress regimes on either side of the MTF. However, because no logging operations took place a t Site U1619, logging data from Site U1618 will substitute and be used in comparison with thos e from Site U1620. Nevertheless, an important operational accomplishment was acquiring som e logging data for these sites, along with Site U1623; collectively, these provide a set of north–south and proximal–distal logs to complement the spatial coverage of the expedition core records.  

One unintended operational event occurred during the expedition, as well. Because of a discrepancy between the approved seismic shotpoint and the coordinates provided in the Scientific Prospectus (Lucchi et al., 2023), Site U1622 was the only expedition site that was not drilled into  a sediment drift. Although this was not part of the original plan, it provides a unique opportunity t o examine recent MTDs forming TMFs, which complements the nearby sediment drift records an d will allow collection of important information on TMF formation.  

# 5.2. Preliminary assessment of primary scientific objectives  

Expedition 403 was principally conceived as a paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic investigation. The overarching scientific goal was the reconstruction of WSC (North Atlantic Current) variability; its influence on climate changes, particularly during established key climate transitions occurring since the cold late Miocene/warm early Pliocene ${\sim}5.3\mathrm{\Ma})$ ; and its impact on the Arcti c glaciations, ice shelf development and stability, and sea ice distribution through heat transfer fro m low to north high latitudes and the Arctic Ocean. To meet the main research goal, five primar y paleoceanographic/paleoclimatic objectives were identified (Lucchi et al., 2023):  

• Development of a high-resolution, Late Miocene–Quaternary chronostratigraphic record;   
• Generation of multiproxy data sets to better constrain the potential concurrent forcing mechanisms responsible for Late Miocene–Quaternary climatic transitions;   
• Identification of orbital, suborbital, millennial-scale climate variations and prominent meltwater events accompanying the ice sheet demise;   
• Evaluation of the impact of past prominent meltwater events on the paleoceanography, paleoenvironment, and paleoclimate; and   
• Reconstruction of the paleo-SBSIS dynamic history in relation to changes in the WSC pathways and characteristics as mechanisms inducing ice sheet instability and fast retreat.  

The accomplishment of such objectives required the identification of expanded, continuous, an d temporally extended depositional sequences. Five primary drill sites were initially identified o n sedimentary depocenters (sediment drifts) that built since the Miocene along the western margi n of Svalbard (Bellsund and Isfjorden drifts) and the eastern side of the Fram Strait (Vestnesa an d Svyatogor Ridges) under the direct influence of the WSC receiving at times a considerable sediment input during the growth and decay of the paleo-SBSIS. Three sites located in the close vicinity of the continental margin along a south–north transect (namely, the sites on the Bellsund an d Isfjorden drifts and the site on the east termination of the Vestnesa Ridge) will work as sentinels t o depict the evolution and dynamic of the paleo-SBSIS, whereas the two sites located far from th e continental reaches (on the Svyatogor Ridge and the west termination of the Vestnesa Ridge) contain a better record of the WSC variability and can give a better idea of the regional glacial history, skimmed of possible local factors (Figure F1). The Bellsund drift, in the southernmost area, wa s considered particularly suitable for Pleistocene biostratigraphic, paleoenvironmental, and paleoclimatic reconstructions because it contains the most expanded depositional record of very war m Pleistocene interglacials (e.g., MISs 5, 7–13, and 31), and previous studies indicated the consisten t presence of biogenic fraction useful for environmental constraints through taxa paleoecology, biomarkers, and stable isotopes. Contextually, because of the close location to the paleo-SBSIS terminus, the Bellsund drift was considered an ideal drilling location for time constraints of ocean–ic e sheet interactions and mutual feedback. By accounting those aspects, drill sampling at th e Bellsund drift was divided into two sites (U1621 and U1623), with the site located on the uppe r reaches of the drift (Site U1621) containing the most expanded sequence recovered during Expedition 403 $({\sim}245\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{My})$ ). The two companion Bellsund sites, together with a third unforeseen sit e located on a nearby TMF depositional system, were treated as a set of sites. The shipboard investigation of the Bellsund drift sites confirmed our expectations of a very high resolution paleo record, and they will be the main targeted sites for shore-based investigations. On the other hand, the tw o sites recovered in the distal area (Site U1619 on the west termination of the Vestnesa Ridge an d Site U1620 on the Svyatogor Ridge) contain the longest time record and will allow for a bette r understanding of the warm Pliocene climate, the onset of the NHG, and the Late Miocene–Earl y Pliocene transition. Additionally, as the most distal site from the paleo-SBSIS, the lithology an d micropaleontology of Site U1620 (Svyatogor Ridge) will complement the more proximal sites (e.g., U1618 and U1621–U1624) by recording the regional ice-rafting history and the evolution of th e WSC, including the variability of water mass characteristics.  

Although most of the primary objectives of the paleoceanographic research will need extensiv e shore-based laboratory work to be accomplished (i.e., isotopic analyses, biomarkers, trace elements, etc.), some preliminary results were achieved during the expedition through onboard multidisciplinary investigation.  

# 5.2.1. High-resolution Late Miocene–Quaternary chronostratigraphy  

Expedition 403 successfully recovered highly promising sedimentary records, in total over $5300\;\mathrm{m}$ long, dating back to the Late Miocene $({\sim}5.3{-}6.0\ \mathrm{Ma})$ (Figure F9). A good preliminary age mode l was established by combining the magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy on the identificatio n of main paleomagnetic reversals and nannofossils biomarkers and biozones, in places corroborated by the occurrence at depth of typical age diatoms assemblages, foraminifera, and dinocyst s biomarkers (Figure F12). The preliminary age model confirmed the presence of expande d sequences suitable for high-resolution paleoceanographic reconstructions. In particular, Sit e U1619 on the west termination of the Vestnesa Ridge contains the most expanded full Pliocen e depositional record ever recovered on Arctic margins $(\sim\!350\!-\!360\,\mathrm{m})$ , and Site U1621 on the uppe r reaches of the Bellsund drift contains a very expanded Quaternary sequence, having an overal l sedimentation rate of ${\sim}245~\mathrm{m/My}$ . Preliminary biostratigraphic analyses on the recovered recor d allowed for the identification of main Pleistocene warm interglacials (e.g., MISs 5, 11–13, and 31 ) as well as warm events that occurred during the Pliocene time.  

The age model will be refined during shore-based analyses. In particular, the magnetostratigraphi c analyses were complicated by the frequent occurrence of the authigenic Fe-sulfide mineral greigite, contributing to a diagenetic overprint on the primary detrital magnetization of sediments. Th e mixture of detrital and authigenic (e.g., greigite) mineral sources is illustrated by bimodal distributions of the ARM coercivity (Figure F11). Further work using temperature-dependent, in-field, mineralogical, and SEM/EDS methods will be needed to gain a more complete understanding o f the magnetic minerals present, particularly at Sites U1618, U1619 (Vestnesa Ridge sites), an d U1620 (Svyatogor Ridge site). Magnetic data from late Quaternary sediments at Sites U1621, U1622 (Bellsund drift sites), and U1624 (Isfjorden drift site) suggest the detrital magnetic minera l assemblage was less altered by diagenesis and indicate potential for higher resolution magnetostratigraphic studies using paleosecular variation and relative paleointensity.  

Dinoflagellate cyst samples were prepared on board with a nonacid technique for safety reasons. Although this preparation worked well for Pleistocene sediments, it was more problematic fo r Pliocene and Miocene sediments. Palynological analyses on shore will benefit from a traditiona l acid-based preparation. Selected samples from the Pleistocene, Pliocene, and Miocene will be prepared and analyzed to improve the resolution of the ship-based dinocyst stratigraphy.  

# 5.2.2. Reconstruction of the paleo-SBSIS dynamic history and identification of cyclicity  

A preliminary assessment of the Pleistocene dynamics of the paleo-SBSIS was conducted using th e identification of the sediment lithologies and the depositional facies depicted in the X-radiographs. The sediment facies evidenced a marked change in the style of ice sheet dynamic, changing from  a less dynamic mode with low frequency delivering of large volume of glacigenic sediments durin g the early Pleistocene to a highly dynamic ice sheet with frequent, almost continuous input o f glacigenic products during the late Quaternary. This change in glacial dynamics is also evident i n most of the core scan analyses and in particular the NGR and the sediment color reflectance measurements (CIELAB) indexes that clearly depict a sharp shift from a low to high cyclicity mode. Interestingly, this shift in the glacial dynamic corresponds to a consistent decrease in the sedimentation rate that was observed in all the studied drilled sites, and it is coherent with the major findings observed in other previously drilled sites in the area, including the Hovgaard Ridge, Mollo y Basin, and Yermak Plateau (ODP Leg 151; Thiede and Myhre, 1996), and therefore reflects a mai n regional change in the depositional style. Promising information derived also from the shipboar d analysis of the clay mineral assemblage to determine the source area of the glacigenic input an d from the determination of the TOC/TN ratios to distinguish periods of continental organic matte r input (glacial stages and terminations) versus periods of dominant bottom current sedimentatio n with organic matter of marine origin (interglacials). Shore-based analyses will benefit the ver y large stratigraphic record collected in strategic areas for a better constraint of the paleo-SBSIS history.  

# 5.3. Preliminary assessment of secondary scientific objectives  

The secondary objectives fall into two categories: tectonic and microbiologic. Initial progress wa s made toward the secondary science objectives by the inclusion of special shipboard sampling an d experiment, as well as by standard coring and logging operations.  

One of the tectonic objectives of the expedition science was to acquire geomechanical and petrophysical data to better constrain the spatial variations of subseabed sediment deformation cause d by regional tectonic and glacial stresses. Very good progress was made shipboard by collectin g time-sensitive geomechanical data in a set of ASR experiments that focused on samples from site s north (U1618 and U1619) and south (U1620) of the MTF. Shipboard results were promising, an d postexpedition processing will be performed to determine the principal stress azimuths. Integration of headspace gas measurements in the experimental methods has also enabled research tha t can examine carbon transport (methane seepage) in relation to the stress regimes. Additionally,  a similar experiment was run for a sample from Site U1623, in this case to better understand th e stress that the likely glacially induced MTD emplaced at Site U1622 may have had on preexistin g slope deposits of Site U1623. The petrophysical data collection toward the tectonic objective wa s partially met by the logging at Sites U1620 and U1618 (including FMS-sonic imaging at Sit e U1618). Integrating the ASR experimental results, FMS imaging, and existing seismic data an d stress modeling will advance research on this objective.  

A second tectonic objective aimed at reducing uncertainties in the spreading rates of the Mollo y and Knipovich Ridges by identifying the spatial location of Miocene–Pliocene sediments nort h and south of the MTF, which connects these two spreading axes. Progress on this objective wa s made by recovery of the long $(>600\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ , temporally well constrained records at the Vestnes a Ridge, which at Site U1619 extend to the late Miocene $(\sim\!6\,M\mathbf{a})$ , and at the Svyatogor Ridge, whic h in Hole U1620D extend to at least the mid-Pliocene $\left({\sim}3.3\mathrm{\Ma}\right)$ . Core-seismic data will also b e important to map the spatial extent of the record observed in cores from these sites.  

The microbiologic objectives of the expedition aimed to investigate the influence of the WSC variability, ice coverage, and climate on the microbial populations through time and to what exten t this is still affecting contemporary geochemical fluxes. Although much of the progress toward thi s objective will occur postexpedition, the sampling protocols, the number of samples obtained, an d the shipboard control testing lay the foundation for a robust and relevant postexpedition microbiological research. A total of 897 samples (including controls) for sedaDNA were collected at al l sites except Site U1624 (Isfjorden drift). The sediments were collected at high resolution ( $\sim$ every  2 ky) at selected intervals identified through biostratigraphy, targeting the Last Glacial Maximu m through the Holocene and the warm interglacials MIS 5, MIS 11, and MIS 31. The samples wer e collected under strict contamination control during both drilling and sampling. The samples wer e stored on board the vessel in a temperature-controlled environment, and they will be analyzed a t home-based laboratories (Norway and Australia). Additional whole-round samples were also collected in the deep sequence of Sites U1619 and U1620 to investigate the oldest sedaDNA. I f sedaDNA is detected (deep sediment a $\mathrm{\pmb{g}e=\sim\!4\,M a})$ ), it would significantly advance research in thi s area because currently the oldest sedaDNA are from Greenland with an age of $2\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Kjær et al., 2022).  

# 5.4. Additional opportunities for cross-disciplinary scientific research  

Although the expedition science objectives did not directly focus on gas hydrate systems, the core s and shipboard data (e.g., geochemical, sedimentological, physical properties, and logging) offe r promising opportunities for cross-disciplinary research to better characterize gas hydrate system s and fluid flow in sediment drifts. Although much work has been done on these topics using geophysical surveys and short piston cores, especially on the Vestnesa Ridge, the core record s obtained during Expedition 403 open doors to much more extensive research. The drilled stratigraphic sequence of Svyatogor Ridge (Site U1620) is particularly special because it extends hundreds of meters deeper than any previous coring work in this unusual setting; thus, there is  a unique opportunity to groundtruth hypotheses about gas-charged sediment drifts that overli e young oceanic crust, including the nature of biotic and abiotic gas generation processes. We als o see good potential for gas hydrate studies that intersect with the primary objectives of Expeditio n 403, such as the possible relationships between gas hydrate stability and paleo–ice sheet stability.  

# 6. Outreach  

The Outreach and Education team for Expedition 403 was composed of three onboard outreac h officers (OOOs) from the United States. The primary goal of the OOO team is to produce a featurelength documentary film that includes significant footage from Expedition 403. In a slightl y unconventional manner, the three officers worked together on the same shift to accommodat e shooting a feature-length documentary on the subject of paleoclimate research, of which Expedition 403 will be a central focus. The three members worked a $12~\mathrm{{h}}$ shift, altering their schedul e throughout the expedition to cover subjects and events during both night and day shifts. The tea m shared written content, photography, video, and live broadcast responsibilities. As a team, the y communicated the science goals through written articles, blog posts, and social media content. The team focused on making compelling content that communicated both the excitement of th e science and the feeling of adventure of being at sea in the Arctic.  

# 6.1. Live broadcasts  

Going into the expedition, the OOO team knew that broadcasting would not be the primar y means of outreach because of the high recovery rate and the time allotted for filming. Emphasi s was placed on media that would live past the expedition. That being said, the team never turne d down a request that came in. The audiences ranged from undergraduate students, urban hig h schools, summer internship and graduate programs, and master’s level II students (Advance d Master in Sustainable Blue Economy). Notably, there were two broadcasts with IODP China, on e with an audience in the thousands and the second with a viewership of ${\sim}1.5$ million, as well as th e first JOIDES Resolution expedition broadcast to Sri Lanka. In an effort to tailor each tour to th e needs of the audience, the team would coordinate in advance with scientists who matched eac h audience’s needs; because of this, each broadcast was different. Broadly speaking, the tours woul d typically begin in the conference room, introducing the history of the program and a brief overview of the goals of the expedition, and then move up the stairwell into the bridge deck to spea k with the Co-Chief Scientists and Expedition Project Manager before looking out onto the rig floo r and moving into the core laboratory through the catwalk. Through the laboratory, the tour woul d typically follow the same steps as a core on deck, grabbing explanations from working scientist s and techs to help us understand each step along the way. Depending on the focus of the audience, longer discussions with scientists were arranged in advance. With legacy in mind, the tea m worked to capture the broadcasts in high-quality formats using a cinema camera and high-qualit y microphone in addition to the streaming device so that the broadcast could be edited, shared, an d utilized afterward. This became increasingly important when assisting members of the scienc e party led presentations for their home institutions because of the diversity of languages, rangin g from Italian to Japanese to Sinhalese. Each of these tours can be used in the future as an educational tool to inspire audiences that may not have been able to engage with the content otherwise.  

# 6.2. Expedition activities  

Two articles were published during expedition, with two more in discussion to be published jus t after the expedition. The first piece was published with Oceanographic, a marine lifestyle magazine focused on conservation, exploration, and adventure. This article covers the beginning o f Expedition 403 and the program at large and focuses on the scientific goals of Expedition 40 3 based on interviews with the two Co-Chief Scientists. It is written in a first-person point of vie w about the experience and life on board the ship. The second article was written for Mold, a foo d magazine, featuring the ship’s catering staff. Food served as a conduit to speak about the scientifi c goals of the expedition. Both publications were selected for their audience size, diversity, and lac k of exposure to IODP.  

Additionally, the OOO team maintained a regular social media presence, including one blog article that covered the Windows systems issue that crashed computers around the globe and halte d the ability to continue coring. The article documented the incredible work by the Marine Computer Specialist team on board to get the system back up and running so the ship could get back t o coring. The OOOs also created a number of custom animations for social media platforms and fo r long-form web content. Notably, it was an Instagram post celebrating international #showyourstripesday that featured a visual effects (VFX) animation of the ship decorated in the warmin g stripe graphics from Svalbard. The stripes are visual representations of the change in temperatur e as measured in each country, region, or city over the past $^{100+}$ y. They also created a web serie s showcasing the experience of the expedition, entitled “The Adventures of the ${\mathrm{J}}{{\mathrm{R}}},^{\prime\prime}$ which take s inspiration from the classic documentary style of early National Geographic films and the films o f  

Jacques Cousteau. Additionally, they have been creating a detailed $360^{\circ}$ tour of JOIDES Resolution, shooting extensive $360^{\circ}$ photos for the purpose of preserving the legacy of the ship in a digita l twin. The group recorded footage throughout the expedition, both in photo and video. Wit h archive in mind, they also shot portraits of everyone on board on $16~\mathrm{mm}$ film to match the loo k and feel of the early documentation of the very start of the program. Despite the refitting, much o f JOIDES Resolution looks very similar to how it did initially; by matching the film, it creates a visua l callback to the beginning of the program. Three goals were kept in mind throughout the outreac h of the expedition: legacy, new engagement, and celebrating the individuals who make this researc h possible. Celebrating the cooking staff, the Marine Computer Specialist team, and the drill floo r are all done in an effort to showcase the range of skills that are needed on an expedition. Most o f the posts, articles, and videos were made with the intent of reaching a new audience and fosterin g an interest that would lead them to the history of content created throughout the program.  

# 6.3. Social media  

The OOO team maintained the various social media accounts, with the largest engagement an d growth being on Instagram. The account saw growth past 5000 followers, with the organic reac h going up by $299.2\%$ . Twitter still saw over 400 shares across posts, and Facebook engaged the mos t with the video content. The content was tailored for each platform, using high-quality video an d photos to communicate the time on board. An ongoing series titled “Meet The Science Party ” showcased several researchers. The series featured photos from previous field work and response s to questions that demonstrate an investment in science and what a life practicing it looks like. Overall, the OOO team shared a total of 216 posts across platforms. Notably, outside of th e growth of new audiences, there was a large amount of engagement with the networks of scientist s on board. Posts, videos, and articles were being shared back home with excitement.  

# 6.4. Media and individual project  

Expedition 403 was featured across publications such as The Smithsonian magazine, the BBC , Oceanographic magazine, EOS, Corriere della Sera newspaper (Italy), Der Spiegel online magazin e (Germany), MOLD magazine, and the New York Times newspaper. One interview with the BBC’ s “Science in Action” podcast was conducted that discussed the goals and significance of the expedition. The outreach team assisted in writing, coordinating, and providing visual content for publication. The group shot a number of drone photos, one of which features JOIDES Resolution wit h Svalbard in the background, that have been shared for publication with two journals and multipl e articles. Much of the work on board went into the shooting of a feature-length documentary. Indepth interviews covered the science, logistics, and legacy of this expedition and program, as wel l as coverage of the process of drilling, processing, and archiving of the sediment cores. With legac y in mind, the shooting style was to get what was needed for the story but also cast a wide net t o capture all aspects of the ship and program that made it possible.
