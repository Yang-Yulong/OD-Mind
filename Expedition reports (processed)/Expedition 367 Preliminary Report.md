# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 367 is th e first of two consecutive cruises that form the South China Se a Rifted Margin program. Expeditions 367 and 368 share the common key objectives of testing scientific hypotheses of breakup of th e northern South China Sea (SCS) margin and comparing its riftin g style and history to other nonvolcanic or magma-poor rifted margins. Four primary sites were selected for the overall program: on e in the outer margin high (OMH) and three seaward of the OMH o n distinct, margin-parallel basement ridges. These ridges are informally labeled A, B, and C within the continent–ocean transitio n (COT) zone going from the OMH to the steady-state oceanic crus t of the SCS. The main scientific objectives include  

1. Determining the nature of the basement within critical crustal units across the COT of the SCS that are critical to constrain style of rifting,   
2. Constraining the time interval from initial crustal extension and plate rupture to the initial generation of igneous ocean crust,   
3. Constraining vertical crustal movements during breakup, and   
4. Examining the nature of igneous activity from rifting to seafloor spreading.  

In addition, sediment cores from the drill sites will provide information on the Cenozoic regional tectonic and environmental development of the Southeast Asia margin.  

Expedition 367 successfully completed operations at two of th e four primary sites (Site U1499 on Ridge A and Site U1500 on Ridg e B). At Site U1499, we cored to $1081.8\;\mathrm{m}$ in 22.1 days, with $52\%$ recovery, and then logged downhole data from 655 to $1020\ \mathrm{m}$ . In 3 1 days at Site U1500, we penetrated to $1529\,\mathrm{m}$ , cored a total of 1012. 8 m with $37\%$ recovery, and collected log data from 842 to $1133\;\mathrm{m}.$ . A t each site we drilled to reach the depth of the main seismic reflecto r (acoustic basement), which prior to the expedition had been interpreted to be crystalline basement. Our objective was to determin e which lithospheric layer constitutes the basement of the COT an d whether there was middle or lower continental crust or subcontinental lithospheric mantle exhumed in the COT before the fina l lithospheric breakup. At Site U1499, coring ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ into the acoustic basement sampled sedimentary rocks, including early Miocen e chalks underlain by pre-Miocene polymict breccias and poorly cemented gravels composed of sandstone pebbles and cobbles. Preliminary structural and lithologic analysis suggested that the gravel s might be early synrift to prerift sediment. At Site U1500, the mai n seismic reflector corresponds to the top of a basalt sequence a t ${\sim}1379.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . We cored $149.90\;\mathrm{m}$ into this volcanic package, recovering $114.92\:\mathrm{m}\:(77\%)$ of sparsely to moderately plagioclase-phyric basalt comprising numerous lava flows including pillow lavas wit h glass, chilled margins, altered veins, hyaloclastites, and minor sediment. Preliminary geochemical analyses show that the basalt i s tholeiitic. We speculate that the basalt might belong to the ver y early stage of magmatism prior to steady-state seafloor spreadin g (known as an “embryonic ocean” regime).  

Sampling of the Pleistocene to lower Miocene sedimentary section at Sites U1499 and U1500 was not continuous for two reasons. First, there was extremely poor recovery within substantial interval s interpreted to be poorly lithified sands. Second, we chose to dril l down without coring in some sections at Site U1500 to ensure sufficient time to achieve this site’s high-priority deep objectives. Nevertheless,  the  upper  Miocene  basin  sequence,  consisting  o f interbedded claystone, siltstone, and sandstone, is continuous o n seismic reflection profiles, and can be correlated between the tw o sites using both seismic reflectors and biostratigraphy. Togethe r with results from other holes previously drilled in the SCS, thes e samples will help to constrain changes in paleoceanographic conditions during the Miocene in this part of the SCS basin.  

# Introduction  

The South China Sea (SCS) margin (Figure F1) is an accessibl e and well-imaged location where drilling of synrift sediment and underlying basement will provide key constraints on the processes o f rifting and eventual rupturing of the continental lithosphere durin g breakup at a highly extended rifted margin. Expedition 367/368 wa s based on International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) drillin g Proposals 878-CPP, 878-Add, 878-Add2, and 878-Add3. This project was implemented as a single science program with 114 days o f drilling operations spread across two IODP expeditions as outline d in the Expedition 367/368 Scientific Prospectus (Sun et al., 2016b). Two expeditions were required to drill four deep-penetration site s in a transect across the margin. Three sites targeted acoustic basement in the continent–ocean transition (COT) and one site targete d late prerift to synrift sequences on the landward side of the transect.  

Although the primary focus of this drilling expedition is to discriminate between possible models for rifting and plate rupture, th e drilling, along with results from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Le g 184 and IODP Expedition 349, addresses a secondary objective o f providing much improved constraints on the Cenozoic development of the southeast Asian margin as recorded within the Sout h China Sea Basin. The strategy for Expedition 367/368, however, wa s entirely optimized to achieve the primary deep basement corin g and logging objectives.  

# Background  

# Global questions regarding formation of rifted margins  

The Ocean Drilling Program (1985–2003) made a major effor t along the rifted margins of the North Atlantic to understand th e processes of continental breakup (ODP Legs 103, 104, 149, 152, 163, 173, and 210). This has resulted in the recognition of two end-members of rifted margins (see summary of observations in Sun et al., 2016a, 2016b):  

Volcanic rifted margins: The examples are characterized b y massive igneous activity in a relatively short period of time $({\sim}1{-}3\$ million years) during breakup and initial seafloor spreading. Th e pair of conjugate margins of Greenland and northwest Europe is  a type example. In these locations, the asthenospheric mantle ma y have been anomalously hot (e.g., mantle plumes), leading to thermal weakening of the continental lithosphere followed by rapid plat e rupture.  

Magma-poor rifted margins: The examples that have bee n drilled so far show hyperextension of the continental crust, wit h tectonic extension eventually leading to exhumation and serpentinization of the subcontinental mantle lithosphere. The Newfoundland and Iberia conjugate margin, where serpentinite occupies  a broad zone within the COT zone, is an example of this type. Th e introduction of water into the subcontinental lithospheric mantle i s interpreted to have taken place through deep, crust-cutting faults. This caused serpentinization that profoundly weakens the mantl e lithosphere and facilitates plate rupture. The subsequent ultraslo w spreading led to formation of additional serpentinite on the seafloo r (e.g., Dick et al., 2003) until higher spreading rates allowed sufficien t magma production for normal oceanic crust to form.  

Other examples of highly extended rifted margins have bee n identified in seismic reflection data elsewhere (e.g., Brune et al., 2017; Doré and Lundin, 2015). However, it is not known if serpentinized mantle plays a critical role in all cases. Modeling b y Huismans and Beaumont (2008, 2011) suggests several scenarios fo r the formation of rifted margins in the absence of anomalously ho t asthenospheric mantle. One scenario (Type I of Huismans an d Beaumont, 2011) is the Iberia-Newfoundland–type margin described above. In this case, lithospheric thinning initially occurs i n the (upper) crust, with extensional faults profoundly thinning th e continental crust (hyperextension), eventually reaching the mantl e and causing serpentinization (Whitmarsh et al., 2001; Pérez-Gussinyé and Reston, 2001; Pérez-Gussinyé et al., 2006; Reston, 2009; Sutra and Manatschal, 2012). Alternative modeling scenarios suggest that final plate rupture can occur without exhumation of th e subcontinental  mantle  and  associated  serpentinization  durin g breakup (Figure F2).  

It is not easy to determine if tectonic exhumation reached th e subcontinental mantle using seismic data alone; drilling control i s needed. However, only one of the highly extended margins has bee n drilled (the conjugate Iberia-Newfoundland margins mentione d above). The highly extended northern margin of the SCS is an excellent location for drilling to constrain seismic interpretations of th e style of rifting.  

# Geological setting  

The SCS is a modestly sized young ocean basin that forme d along the eastern boundary of the Eurasian plate during mid- to lat e Cenozoic time (Figure F1). Expeditions 367 and 368 cored an d logged a transect of drill sites across the COT in the northern SCS. The seafloor in this region is thought to have first formed at ${\sim}32{-}30$ Ma with a later expansion of seafloor spreading into the southwes t SCS (Briais et al., 1993; Barckhausen and Roeser, 2004; Li et al., 2012a, 2012b; Franke et al., 2013).  

The continental crust that was rifted to form the SCS was accreted to the Asian margin during the Mesozoic (Zhou and Li, 2000; Zhou et al., 2008; Li et al., 2012a, 2012b). Within ${\sim}80$ million years, this relatively young continental lithosphere underwent extensiv e rifting during the Paleogene, most likely from the early Eocene ( $[{\sim}45\$ Ma). Seafloor spreading in the SCS started in the early Oligocene, with the oldest interpreted magnetic anomaly in the vicinity of th e drilling transect being Anomaly C11 $(\sim\!30\mathrm{\Ma})$ or C12n ${\bf\[\sim}31\mathrm{~Ma)}$ (Briais et al., 1993; Li et al., 2013, 2014; Franke et al., 2013). Thes e studies concluded that seafloor spreading ceased within the middl e Miocene. The initial half-spreading rate was ${\sim}3.6\;\mathrm{cm/y},$ which the n dropped to $1.2\,\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{y}$ and stopped by $15\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Li et al., 2014). The initial spreading rate in the SCS basin therefore provides for differen t geodynamic boundary conditions than the ultraslow spreading scenario of the Iberia-Newfoundland margin. Subduction of the eastern part of the SCS basin started at or before ${\sim}15$ Ma along th e Manila  Trench  (Li  et  al.,  2013).  However,  this  essentiall y postspreading subduction did not affect the northern SCS margin. For a more complete review of the regional setting and tectonic development of the SCS, see Shi and Li (2012), Li et al. (2013), Sun e t al. (2014), and Franke et al. (2013).  

The Expedition 367/368 drilling transect is located ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{km}$ wes t of IODP Site U1435 (Figures F1, F3, F4) (Li et al., 2015c) along th e northern SCS margin. The oldest seafloor spreading magneti c anomaly identified on this specific part of the northern SCS margi n is most likely no older than Anomaly C11 $\left({\sim}30\mathrm{~Ma}\right)$ (i.e., slightl y younger by ${\sim}1{-}2$ million years than further east along the norther n SCS margin where Anomaly C12 is interpreted to be present). Thi s segment of the SCS margin exhibits a broad zone $({\sim}150{-}200\,\mathrm{km})$ o f across-margin crustal stretching and extension prior to breakup. Within this zone, seismic data (Figures F3, F4, F5) exhibit three distinct ridges (A, B, and C) along the seaward margin of the COT a s well as an outer margin high (OMH), each of which was targeted b y this drilling transect (Figure F5).  

We define the COT as the broad $^{\left(100-150\,\mathrm{km}\right)}$ ) zone from moderately thinned continental crust ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{km}$ thick) to the thin $(\sim\!6\,\mathrm{km})$ crust below the ocean basin (Figure F5). We refer to the continent/ocean boundary (COB) as the much narrower zone in whic h the outermost, highly thinned continental lithosphere is replace d seawards by crust that formed within a narrow zone at a spreadin g ridge in a steady-state fashion. The latter can include continuou s tectonic exhumation of rising lithospheric mantle (e.g., Dick et al., 2003), accretion of normal igneous oceanic crust, or a mixture o f these two processes.  

Clear Mohorovicic seismic discontinuity (Moho) seismic reflections (Figure F5) show distinct thinning of the continental crus t across the COT with a thickness of ${\sim}6~\mathrm{km}$ around the interprete d COB. Separate layers hypothesized to be upper, middle, and lowe r crust are present within the landward part of these seismic profiles. The lower crust is acoustically transparent and can be as thin a s only ${\sim}6~\mathrm{km}$ . Lower crust with a similar thickness and seismic appearance is reported from the northeastern SCS margin (McIntos h et al., 2013, 2014; Lester et al., 2013). The seaward continuation o f this crustal layering into the COB zone is, however, ambiguous.  

The upper crust shows numerous extensional, low-angle detachment faults soling out at midcrustal level. This fault system generated a number of deep half-grabens filled with synrift sediment, subsequently covered by postrift sediment. The synrift sediment i s topped by a breakup unconformity (T70 in Figure F5). Industr y data (distant wells with only cuttings and log data) and Site U143 5 results suggest a break-up unconformity age of ${\sim}32\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , but thi s needed to be verified by coring data (Figure F5). This unconformit y is interpreted to reflect the end of the main crustal extension. However, the time of crustal extension is not necessarily synchronou s across the margin and could be younger toward the outer margin.  A younger, widely distributed unconformity (T60) is also shown i n Figure F5 and likely reflects the development of a shallower continental margin and a true, deep oceanic basin. The unconformit y may correspond to a hiatus at ${\sim}23\ \mathrm{Ma}$ found at ODP Site U114 8 (Wang, Prell, Blum, et al., 2000) and at site U1435; it is approximately synchronous with a southward jump of the SCS spreadin g axis (Briais et al., 1993).  

The distinct OMH of seismic Line 1555 is also well develope d on seismic Line 15ecLW8 (see figure F5 in Sun et al., 2016b). Thes e basement structures are quite reminiscent of the structure drilled a t Site U1435, but here they are located farther inland of the interpreted magnetic Anomaly C11 than at Site U1435 (Figure F3). Thi s would be consistent with an interpretation of a wider zone of significant crustal extension within this westerly margin segment compared to that of Site U1435 farther east.  

Seaward of the OMH, seismic data (e.g., Figures F4, F5) sho w the presence of the three basement Ridges A, B, and C within an d south of the COT, close to but landward of the interpreted boundary between continental and oceanic lithosphere (COB). The seismic images of these basement highs are different from those of th e OMH fault blocks. In particular, Ridge A is for the most part mor e dome-like, with neither normal faults nor clearly developed synrif t half-grabens on the landward-facing part of these structures (Sit e U1499 and proposed alternate sites). Note that magnetic Anomal y C11 is projected to almost overlap the seaward part of Ridge A. Excluding sediment, the crust below this outermost basement high i s only ${\sim}6.4–8~\mathrm{km}$ using ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) velocit y constraints of Yan et al. (2001), Wang et al. (2006), and Wei et al. (2011). Seaward of Ridge A, the crust has a fairly uniform thicknes s of $\sim\!6\,\mathrm{km}$ , which could be consistent with oceanic crust (Yan et al., 2001). However, the existence of highly thinned continental crust o r serpentinized mantle cannot be ruled out. The nature of the basement within these three ridges is key to constrain tectonic model s for the margin development.  

In the general summary of key structures (Figure F5; see als o Figure F6B in Sun et al., 2016b), the normal faults of the upper, brittle crust sole out within a main detachment zone located above o r within the middle crust. This suggests decoupling between uppe r and lower crustal extension. The lower crust within the COT ma y thicken oceanward (lower crustal flow?), but this is not well image d beneath the COB. Likewise, seismic imaging of the low-angle fault s and detachments within the landward part of the COT cannot wit h confidence be traced through the COB, leaving widely different interpretations of the nature of the COB possible.  

One possibility is that the main detachment zone itself becam e exhumed during final breakup. This would imply that the forme r position of the main detachment zone actually was above the outermost basement high (i.e., Site U1499 at Ridge A) and that eithe r lower crust or serpentinized mantle is present within Ridge A. Alternatively, if the main detachment underlies Ridge A, one woul d expect Ridge A to comprise upper crustal material.  

Alternatively, the “Moho” in this zone below the COT may be  a serpentinization front. Sampling of basement on Ridge A, such as a t site U1499, is therefore pivotal to constrain crustal structure an d critical aspects of the extension process.  

Both Ridges B and C consist of fault blocks rotated landwar d along seaward-dipping normal faults. Some of these faults may b e seismically traced to the base of the crust. Ridge B shows seismi c features along strike and within the uppermost crust that could b e consistent with a volcanic origin. However, these features could als o be consistent with a rotated fault block of upper continental crus t (i.e., a distal extensional rider of upper-plate origin), in which cas e there might be prerift sediment below the breakup unconformit y defining the top of acoustic basement at Ridge B. The possibility o f Ridge B representing exhumed lower crust or mantle is less likely. Ridge C in many ways is seismically similar to Ridge B. However, a n apparent reversed magnetic anomaly strongly suggests that thi s ridge represents igneous ocean crust.  

Sampling the basement at Ridges A, B, and C is therefore essential for Expeditions 367/368 to distinguish between different tectonic models for breakup along highly extended margins. Ridges  A and B help to constrain the style of rifting. In contrast, Ridge C i s assumed to represent the early igneous crust and will address another key objective of Expeditions 367 and 368: to constrain the nature of early oceanic crust formation. This includes determinin g how quickly after breakup a robust igneous system was established, what mantle source is involved (e.g., wet/dry, temperature), unde r what conditions mantle melting occurs (degree and depth of melting), and the contribution of continental crustal contamination.  

# Expedition objectives  

This two-expedition drilling transect across the SCS margi n (Figure F1) was implemented to understand the processes of rifting, eventual rupturing of the continental crust, and the onset of igneous oceanic crust at a highly extended rifted margin. Four primar y and sixteen alternate drill sites across a $150{-}200\ \mathrm{km}$ wide well-imaged COT zone were targeted as part of the overall program (se e Sun et al., 2016b). Expedition 367 set out to conduct operations a t two of the primary sites (U1499, U1500) (Figures F1, F2, F3, F4, an d F5).  

The most landward site (U1501), located on the OMH shown i n Figure F4, will target late prerift to synrift sediment within a rotate d fault-block overlain by postrift sediment. Data from the site will constrain the timing of rifting, rate of extension, and rifting environment, including subsidence prior to breakup. However, to constrain how deeply the continental crust was exhumed durin g breakup, we need to know the nature of the basement at Ridges  A and B. within the COT. Ridge C, at the seaward end of the COB, i s assumed to be the earliest igneous crust and will constrain the nature of the earliest oceanic crust formation.  

The postbreakup sedimentary sections from the developin g ocean basin will constrain the late synrift and postrift subsidenc e history of the margin. This sediment, when combined with previou s ODP and IODP cores, will provide a basis for documenting th e Neogene paleoclimate and environmental changes within the large r southeast Asian region.  

# Drilling, coring, and logging strategy  

Operations for this SCS rifted margin science program were distributed across Expeditions 367 and 368 and were designed to cor e and log through thick sediment sections and, significantly, into underlying basement. We intended that the overall operational approach at each site would be similar and consist of two holes per sit e (Figure F6).  

The first hole at each site was to be cored with the advanced piston corer (APC) and extended core barrel (XCB) systems to ${\sim}650\ \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , and then we would log the hole with the triple combo and Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic tool strings. This APC/XCB hol e was also to document borehole and formation conditions to hel p determine the length of casing to be drilled into the seafloor in th e second hole. All full APC cores were intended to be oriented an d formation temperature measurements made using the advance d piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3).  

The second hole at each site was designed to begin by drilling i n a seafloor reentry system with casing extending to ${\sim}650$ mbsf or t o the depth determined in the first hole. This was intended to enhance our chances of achieving our deep coring and logging objectives. Coring using the rotary core barrel (RCB) system would the n extend from the base of the casing, through the sediment, and int o the underlying basement. Multiple pipe trips to install new RCB bit s were to be made as required. Upon completion of the coring objectives, the RCB bit was to be dropped either in the bottom of the hol e or on the seafloor so that downhole wireline log data could be collected. For this deeper logging, we planned to use the triple comb o and FMS-sonic tool strings as well as the Versatile Seismic Image r (VSI) tool string to conduct check shots.  

During Expedition 367, we had to modify this general operational plan in response to borehole conditions and the need to focu s our operations time to achieve our highest priority basement objectives. The planned versus implemented operations are shown i n Figure F6.  

The pilot hole, U1499A, consisted of APC/XCB coring until refusal. In the first (pilot) hole at Site U1500, we washed down without coring within the limits of safety approval and the requirement s to identify appropriate locations for setting casing in the subsequen t hole. We also decided to not collect downhole log data in either o f these pilot holes partly due to poor borehole conditions that w e thought would not yield good data as well as to focus more time o n the deeper core and log objectives.  

For the primary, deep-penetrating, cased holes at each sit e (Holes U1499B and U1500B), we set as much casing as possible (65 1 m in Hole U1499B and $842~\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1500B) to keep the uppe r part of the hole in stable condition for drilling and to enhance ou r ability to clean cuttings out of such deep holes. Casing was drille d into the seafloor to total depth as a single step at each location t o minimize hole disturbance as well as to save time. We then drille d and cored using the RCB below the casing until we reached th e basement (Hole U1500B) or until hole conditions prevented furthe r coring (Hole U1499B). We collected downhole logging data in th e deep penetration hole at each site.  

# Site summaries  

# Site U1499  

Site U1499 is located on basement Ridge A within the SCS CO T zone ${\sim}60\ \mathrm{km}$ seaward and southeast of the OMH. The goal of drilling here was to core through the sediment to sample the basemen t rocks and thus determine basement age and lithology. This woul d provide a test of different possible models for the processes and rheology controlling the extension and ultimate breakup of the continent. Ridge A was expected to have basement of either uppe r continental crust, lower continental crust, or mantle rocks, whic h might or might not have been serpentinized. Coring and drillin g also constrain the postrift history by determining the age, wate r depth, and subsidence rates of the overlying sedimentary packages.  

We conducted operations in two holes at Site U1499 (propose d Site  SCSII-14A).  Hole  U1499A  is  located  at $18^{\circ}24.5698^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $115^{\circ}51.5881\mathrm{\,E}$ in a water depth of $3760.2\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . In Hole U1499A, APC/XCB coring penetrated from the seafloor to $659.2\textrm{m}$ and recovered $417.05\mathrm{~m~}$ $(63\%)$ . Hole U1499B is located at $18^{\circ}24.5705?\mathrm{N},$ $115^{\circ}51.5990?\mathrm{E}$ in a water depth of $3758.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . We installed casing i n Hole U1499B to $651\,\mathrm{~m~}$ followed by RCB coring that penetrate d from 655.0 to $1081.8\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered $150.64\mathrm{~m~}(35\%)$ . Coring terminated in gravel before deteriorating drilling conditions prevente d further penetration; no crystalline basement was encountered. Despite challenging conditions in the lowermost part of Hole U1499B, two successful wireline logging runs were conducted from 652 t o $1020\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The cored sediment at Site U1499 is divided into nine lithostratigraphic units (Figure F7). Lithostratigraphic Unit I is a $48.85\:\mathrm{m}$ thick middle−upper Pleistocene sequence of dark greenish gray bioclast-rich clay with thin clayey silt and sand interbeds. Fining-upward silty and fine sand intervals are abundant and interpreted a s turbidite sequences. Four thin $(2{-}7\,\mathrm{cm})$ ash layers were identified i n Unit I; none are observed in the deeper units. Unit II (48.85−100.0 4 m) is a $51.19\mathrm{~m~}$ thick lower–middle Pleistocene sequence of interbedded greenish gray clay-rich calcareous ooze and dark greenis h gray nannofossil-rich clay. Synsedimentary deformational structures such as folds, microfaults, and inclined beds are well developed in the sediment of this unit, which is interpreted as a slum p deposit. This unit is underlain by Unit III (Pliocene−middle Pleistocene), which is divided into Subunits IIIA $(100.04–181.80\ \mathrm{m})$ an d IIIB ( $181.80{-}333.65\ \mathrm{m})$ . The $233.61\mathrm{~m~}$ of Unit III is dominated b y dark greenish gray clay with very thin to thin clayey silt and calcareous sand intervals. Subunit IIIA contains clayey silt layers that ar e very thin $\left(<\!1\;\mathrm{cm}\right)$ , whereas Subunit IIIB has abundant thin $(2{-}5\,\mathrm{cm})$ clayey silt layers and an overall increase in nannofossil and foraminifer content. Unit IV $333.65\substack{-404.90\,\mathrm{m}})$ is a $71.25\;\mathrm{m}$ thick sequenc e of upper Miocene–Pliocene dark greenish gray silty sand with cla y interbeds. Recovery is very low throughout the section, but the recovered intervals suggest that the unit may contain unconsolidate d to weakly consolidated sand.  

Unit V $(404.90\substack{-469.45\mathrm{~m}})$ is a $64.55\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence of uppe r Miocene dark greenish gray clay with mostly thin $(<\!5\;\mathrm{cm})$ clayey sil t and foraminifer sand interbeds. Drilling disturbance, in the form o f biscuiting, increases significantly in this unit. Similar to Unit IV, recovery in Unit VI ( $\left(469.45\mathrm{-}618.30\mathrm{\;m}\right)$ is also very low. The recovere d intervals in this unit include upper Miocene dark greenish gray silt y sand with clay interbeds. Unit VII ( $618.30{-}761.70\,\mathrm{~m})$ is mainl y composed of upper Miocene dark greenish gray to dark gray sandstone and claystone with siltstone interbeds. Lithification increase s sharply downhole from the top of this unit, although sections wit h very low recovery are inferred to be nonlithified sand. Unit VII I $(761.70{-}929.02\;\mathrm{m})$ comprises a $167.32\;\mathrm{m}$ thick interval of Miocen e reddish brown to reddish gray claystone and clay-rich chalk. Base d on the abundance of calcareous material, this unit is divided int o two subunits. Subunit VIIIA $^{761.70-892.10\,\mathrm{m})}$ contains lower–upper Miocene dark reddish brown claystone with siltstone and foraminifer sandstone interbeds, whereas Subunit VIIIB (892.10−929.0 2 m) is composed of lower–middle Miocene reddish brown to reddis h gray clay-rich nannofossil chalk and clay-rich chalk. In the lowes t part of Subunit VIIIB, abundant brownish black iron-manganes e nodules occur within reddish brown nannofossil-rich claystone.  

Unit IX $?29.02–1081.80\ \mathrm{m})$ is readily distinguished from th e overlying units by containing pre-Miocene sandstone, claystone, matrix-supported breccia, and gravel. This unit is $152.78\mathrm{~m~}$ thic k and comprises three subunits. Subunit IXA $(929.02–933.28\mathrm{~m})$ ) i s defined by brownish and greenish gray sandstone and breccia. Subunit IXB $933.28–933.35\,\mathrm{~m})$ is defined by dark gray matrix-supported  breccia  in  Core  367-U1499B-30R.  Subunit  IX C $(933.35{-}1081.80\;\mathrm{m})$ contains gray to dark gray gravel with silty san d intervals. The cores in Subunit IXC are completely fragmented an d were recovered as pebbles and cobbles. In general, the pebbles an d cobbles are recycled sedimentary rocks (such as sandstones) tha t contain a variety of individual lithic components including igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic grains. However, the matrix tha t likely surrounded these cobbles and pebbles was not recovered; w e inferred that the matrix is poorly consolidated and washed away b y the drilling process.  

# Structural geology  

The tilting of sedimentary beds and deformation structures observed at Site U1499 are limited to lithostratigraphic Units II, VII, VIII, and IX. The folds, faults, and tilted beds observed in Unit II ar e related to two slump events that reworked older sediment betwee n younger Units I and III. Tilted beds and faults with slickensides ar e observed in Unit VII and VIII. These faults are linked to compaction processes of the clays, and the tilted beds are associated wit h sandy layers. Unit IX is divided into three subunits. In Subunit IXA, tilted beds as well as a downhole increase in clast size, angularity, and proportion of clasts are observed. The matrix-supported breccia of Subunit IXB exhibits no clear deformation structure or tilte d sedimentary bedding. Some of the sandstone and breccia clasts i n Subunit IXC exhibit veins and fractures. These clasts were transported before sedimentation; therefore, their veins and fracture s must have originated in some previous tectonic event.  

# Biostratigraphy  

All core catcher samples at Site U1499 were analyzed for calcareous nannofossil and foraminiferal content, and additional sample s were taken from the split-core sections when necessary to refine th e ages. Preservation of microfossils varies from poor to very good, and total abundance varies from barren to abundant. Althoug h samples exhibit some degree of reworking, 28 biostratigraphic datums are recognized, revealing that we recovered an apparentl y continuous succession of Oligocene to Pleistocene age, spannin g nannofossil Zones NN5–NN21 and foraminifer Zones M4/M3 t o Subzone PT1b. The Pleistocene/Pliocene boundary is located between Cores 367-U1499A-20X and $27\mathrm{X}$ , and the Pliocene/Miocen e boundary is located between Cores 31X and 43X. Sedimentatio n rates varied from ${\sim}8\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the late Miocene to the early Pliocen e and ${\sim}5~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the early Pliocene to the early Pleistocene to ${\sim}13$ $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the middle–late Pleistocene. Extremely low sedimentatio n rates $({\sim}1\,\mathrm{cm/ky})$ occurred in the early to late Miocene during deposition of Unit VIII. The succession of Subunit IXA contains late t o early Oligocene microfossils with calcareous nannofossils that ar e well preserved and abundant, whereas foraminifers are sorted o r sparse. This indicates that Unit IX is probably transported and reworked.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic analysis was conducted on both archive-half sections and discrete samples from the working half. The archive-hal f sections were measured with the pass-through superconductin g rock magnetometer (SRM) with demagnetization steps at 5, 15, an d $25\;\mathrm{mT}$ . The discrete samples were subjected to alternating field (AF ) and thermal demagnetization, and remanence was measured on th e spinner magnetometer. We adopted a combination of stepwise A F and thermal demagnetization steps to fully demagnetize the discrete samples and obtain the characteristic remanent magnetizatio n (ChRM).  

Variations in the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) intensity are well correlated to observable changes in lithology and magnetic susceptibility; for example, the low NRM intensity at ${\sim}60\mathrm{~m~}$ (Core 367-U1499A-7H) agrees with the carbonate-rich slump i n which magnetic susceptibility values are also low. Drilling-induce d remanence was identified and removed in most core sections at A F treatments of $15~\mathrm{mT}$ . In addition, magnetic mineral variations wer e observed from the demagnetization behavior. From Core 367- U1499B-12R downhole, the drilling overprint becomes stronge r and hard to remove with the relatively low AF steps used on the archive-half sections, whereas AF treatments up to $200~\mathrm{mT}$ and temperatures up to $675\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$ could not fully demagnetize the discret e samples. These characteristics confirm the presence of hematit e and magnetite.  

We constructed a Site U1499 magnetostratigraphy based on th e interpretation of the raw paleomagnetic data with stable and clea r demagnetization behaviors. Core orientation from 0 to $162~\mathrm{m}$ wa s used to correct the declinations; downhole from there, our interpretation is based only on inclination data. When making comparison s to the standard geomagnetic timescale, we obtained several ti e points. For example the Brunhes/ Matuyama Chron boundary (0.7 8 Ma) is at ${\sim}110\;\mathrm{m},$ , and the middle of Subchron C2An.3n is placed a t ${\sim}260\;\mathrm{m}$ . We thus conclude that the middle/early Pleistocene boundary $(0.78\,\mathrm{\textbf{Ma}})$ is at ${\sim}110\,\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , the early Pleistocene/late Pliocen e boundary is at ${\sim}220\;\mathrm{m}$ , the late/early Pliocene $\left(3.6\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ boundary i s at ${\sim}260\,\mathrm{m},$ , and early Pliocene/late Miocene boundary $\mathrm{^{5.33}\,M a})$ is a t ${\sim}370\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Geochemistry  

Geochemical analyses were conducted for headspace gas safet y monitoring; quantification of sediment ${\mathrm{CaCO}}_{3},$ organic carbon, an d nitrogen content; and interstitial water characterization. Calciu m carbonate contents vary between 0.4 and $82\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , with higher value s of $>\!20\,\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ corresponding to intervals of nannofossil/foraminife r ooze or chalk. Total organic carbon (TOC) contents mostly rang e from ${\sim}0$ to $\sim1.0\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . TOC decreases gradually downhole from 1. 0 to $0.3\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ in the uppermost $^{110}\,\mathrm{m}$ corresponding to the base of th e sulfate reduction zone, reflecting active degradation of sedimentar y organic matter. The TOC to total nitrogen molar ratio (C/N) i s mostly ${<}8.$ , indicating that TOC is derived dominantly from a marine source.  

Hydrocarbon monitoring shows headspace gas consistently approaching zero throughout the site. Relatively higher methane contents of \~tens to 6000 ppmv occur across the ${\sim}100{-}250$ mbs f interval, just below the sulfate reduction zone. The overall lo w methane content indicates limited microbial methanogenesis likel y caused by low TOC contents $(<\!0.3\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ deeper than 110 mbsf.  

We obtained 58 interstitial water samples from Hole U1499A . The inorganic geochemistry of interstitial water is controlled by th e remineralization of organic matter as well as carbonate and clay diagenesis. The sediment rapidly becomes suboxic, as indicated by  a Mn peak of ${\sim}120~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at $\sim\!6\;\mathrm{m}$ . Sulfate reduction coupled with sedimentary organic matter degradation occurs until ${\sim}110\,\mathrm{~m},$ wit h near-complete depletion until $257\,\textrm{m}$ before increasing slowly t o $16.9\;\mathrm{mM}$ at the bottom of Hole U1499A. The interval of near-complete sulfate consumption is also marked by pronounced high B a concentrations $>50~\upmu M,$ , suggesting the dissolution of barite (Ba$\mathrm{SO}_{4})$ ). The peak alkalinity and steady increase in $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ in th e upper $110\,\mathrm{~m~}$ are consistent with progressive remineralization o f sedimentary organic matter. The gradual decrease in $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ shallowe r than $^{80\textrm{m}}$ suggests active authigenic carbonate precipitation triggered by sulfate reduction. A subsequent downhole increase in $C a^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ is likely caused by biogenic carbonate dissolution and recrystallization. Nearly parallel downhole decreases in $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ are mostly driven by clay mineral cation exchange and/or clay mineral authigenesis. The lower $C1^{-}$ and $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ concentrations compare d to those of seawater at the bottom of the Hole U1499A are mostl y driven by the smectite-illite transformation. Elevated Si concentrations of $700{-}820\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ from the seafloor to $45\;\mathrm{m}$ suggest active dissolution of biogenic silica.  

# Petrophysics  

At Site U1499, measurements of $P$ -wave velocity, bulk density , magnetic susceptibility, and natural gamma radiation (NGR) wer e made on whole-round cores, and additional measurements wer e made on split cores and discrete samples, including thermal conductivity; caliper $P$ -wave velocity (PWC); porosity; and bulk, dry , and grain density. In general, bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, an d thermal conductivity increase with depth, whereas porosity decreases with depth as a result of compaction and lithification. However, some properties, such as NGR or magnetic susceptibility, sho w local variations related to the specific lithology. The soft sedimen t in the upper $100\;\mathrm{m}$ shows rapid compaction with depth, marked b y a decrease in porosity and increase in bulk density and thermal conductivity. Four thin volcanic ash layers in the uppermost $50~\mathrm{m}$ ar e marked by peaks in magnetic susceptibility. The mass transport deposit $(48.85{-}100.04\;\mathrm{m})$ displays low magnetic susceptibility and lo w NGR counts, reflecting the high carbonate content of the calcareou s ooze. Below these layers downhole to ${\sim}890~\mathrm{m},$ , physical propertie s show small variations; bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, and therma l conductivity gradually increase, whereas porosity decreases wit h depth. The NGR and magnetic susceptibility data in this interval d o not show much variation. From 830 to $930\,\mathrm{m}$ , we observed a genera l decrease in magnetic susceptibility values and NGR counts wher e densities increase slightly and $P$ -wave velocities increase significantly from 2200 to $2900\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . These variations are associated with  a significant increase in the carbonate content in the Subunit VIII B chalks. The cobbles and pebbles in the deepest part $(930{-}1080\;\mathrm{m})$ show large variations in NGR, bulk density, and $P$ -wave velocity an d very low magnetic susceptibility.  

# Downhole measurements  

Two downhole logging tool strings were run in Hole U1499B,  a modified triple combo (sonic velocity, NGR, bulk density, resistivity, and caliper) tool string and the FMS-sonic tool string (FMS resistivity images and calipers and NGR). We added the velocity tool to th e first tool string because sonic velocities were needed for an accurat e prediction of basement depth for the subsequent Site U1500 as wel l as to better constrain core-log-seismic correlation. We also did no t know if hole conditions would allow a second logging run. Althoug h stable borehole conditions in Hole U1499B allowed the second FM S logging run, we did not attempt a check shot due to time constraint s and concerns about hole stability. Borehole conditions from th e bottom of the casing at ${\sim}651\mathrm{~m~}$ to the bottom of Hole U1499B a t ${\sim}1020\mathrm{~m~}$ were generally good, with measured diameters from ${\sim}10$ to 16 inches. Washout zones are observed from 670 to $710\,\mathrm{m}$ , whic h corresponds to an interval of very low core recovery, as well as fro m 830 to ${920}\;\mathrm{m}_{}$ , affecting quality of the log data in these intervals. Lo g and core data generally show a good agreement. Downhole loggin g provided information in zones of poor core recovery in Hol e U1499B. The log data from 726 to $739\;\mathrm{m}$ exhibits high NGR value s and low bulk densities and $P$ -wave velocities, whereas the data fro m 820 to $840\,\mathrm{m}$ is characterized by a sharp increase in bulk densities,  a slight increase in $P$ -wave velocities, and an abrupt decrease in NG R values compared to average values above and below these depths. The Subunit VIIIB chalks $(\sim\!890\!-\!930\;\mathrm{m})$ ) display a sharp decrease i n NGR and an increase in bulk density and $\mathrm{P}$ -wave velocity wit h depth, as well as only small variations in resistivity. Deeper than 93 0 m, bulk densities, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocities, and resistivities show larg e variability, in part because of the presence of cobbles and pebbles. The quality of the acquired FMS images is strongly influenced b y hole-diameter variations; they generally show alternating smoot h and patchy textures with contrasting resistivity values marking horizontal to slightly tilted bedding downhole to $930\mathrm{~m~}$ . The deepes t layers of sandstones, breccias, and gravels show highly variable an d oblique textures on the FMS images, possibly reflecting the varie d orientation of the gravel clasts or the presence of faults and fractures in the gravel or the matrix. In general, the velocities measure d with the sonic velocity logging tool match the PWC measurement s taken with the caliper on the split cores. Six in situ formation temperature measurements were made in Hole U1499A and give a geothermal gradient of $93^{\circ}C/\mathrm{km}$ . The estimated heat flow is 11 0 $\mathrm{{mW}/\mathrm{{m}^{2}}}$ , a value in agreement with the general heat flow of the area.  

# Correlation to seismic data  

We used downhole log data and physical property measurements on cores and samples as well as other available data to correlate Site U1499 data with the available seismic reflection profiles. We also used the Site U1499 density and sonic velocity data to create synthetic seismograms that provided additional constraints o n the correlation. Log sonic velocities and PWC velocities are in ver y good agreement except for the deepest breccias and gravels (deepe r than ${\sim}930\;\mathrm{m})$ ) where measurement on individual pebbles leads to a n overestimate of the velocity in the formation. For seismic correlation, we use the PWC and density values from moisture and densit y (MAD) and gamma ray attenuation (GRA) measurements fro m Hole U1499A $\left(0{-}655\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ , whereas below we used the downhole logging velocity and density data. We used a constant velocity of 210 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ in the low-recovery zones (333–406 and $531{-}561\ \mathrm{m})$ ), interpreted to be sandy layers, based on the downhole logging velocit y values measured at greater depth. The comparison of the timedepth relation (TDR) obtained for Site U1499 to those for ODP Sit e 1148 as well as IODP Sites U1431 and U1433 shows substantial agreement, except for the Site 1148 TDR, which shows higher velocities in the deeper layers. The comparison between the seismi c reflectors and the variations in physical properties and litholog y characteristics using the computed Site U1499 TDR shows a goo d correlation between the main upper reflectors and the poor-recovery sandy intervals. However, the main physical property change s related to the top of the deep gravel layer do not correlate to the reflector observed at ${\sim}5.9\;s$ in the seismic profile.  

# Site U1500  

Site U1500 is located on basement Ridge B and is the most seaward site that Expedition 367 drilled within the SCS COT zone. Ridge B is located ${\sim}80~\mathrm{km}$ seaward of the OMH and ${\sim}20~\mathrm{km}$ seaward of Ridge A, where Site U1499 was drilled. The goal of drillin g here was to sample and log the lowermost sediment and underlyin g basement rocks to determine basement age and lithology of th e COT or embryonic oceanic crust. This would provide a test of different possible models for the processes and rheology controllin g the breakup of the continent. Ridge B was expected to have basement of either upper continental crust, lower continental crust, mantle rocks, or oceanic crust. The coring and logging would als o constrain the history of the region after rifting by determining th e age, water depth, and subsidence rates of the overlying sedimentar y packages.  

We conducted operations in two holes at Site U1500 (propose d Site  SCSII-8B).  Hole  U1500A  is  located  at $18^{\circ}18.2762\,\mathrm{N},$ $116^{\circ}13.1916^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ in a water depth of $3801.7\ \mathrm{m}$ . In Hole U1500A, w e drilled without coring from the seafloor to $378.2\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and then core d with the RCB from 378.2 to $494.6\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered $26.5~\mathrm{m}$ $(23\%)$ . Thereafter, we drilled without coring from 494.6 to $641.2\ \mathrm{m},$ , an d cored with the RCB from 641.2 to $854.6~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $67.2~\mathrm{m}$ $(31\%)$ .  

Hole U1500B is located at $18^{\circ}18.2707^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $116^{\circ}13.1951^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ in a water depth of $3801.7\:\mathrm{m}$ . After installing casing, we continuously core d the sediment sequence from 846.0 to $1379.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ ( $533.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ cored; $164.7\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $31\%$ ), and then continuously cored $149.9\;\mathrm{m}$ int o the underlying basalt from 1379.1 to $1529.0\;\mathrm{m}$ $114.92\:\mathrm{m}$ recovered;  

$77\%$ ). This made Hole U1500B the eighth deepest hole that the R/ V JOIDES Resolution has drilled in ODP/IODP history. Three downhole logging strings were run in Hole U1500B from 842 to $1133\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The cored sediment at Site U1500 is divided into eight lithostratigraphic units (Figure F8). The uppermost $378.2\,\mathrm{m}$ of sedimen t was drilled without coring. Lithostratigraphic Unit I (378.2–410. 0 m) is a $31.8\;\mathrm{m}$ thick upper Miocene sequence of greenish gray heavily bioturbated clay with silt and sandy silt interbeds. Some of th e clay intervals are nannofossil rich. Structure in the clay is mostl y massive, but parallel laminations occur in the silt and sandy sil t interbeds. Unit II $(410.0–494.6\,\mathrm{m})$ is an upper Miocene sequence o f interbedded dark greenish gray clay and silt. Recovery was very lo w for this unit $(\sim\!8\%)$ , which may indicate a change in lithology (e.g., increased abundance of nonlithified sands). This unit is underlai n by another interval drilled without coring $(494.6–641.2\,\mathrm{m})$ ).  

Unit III $\mathbf{\dot{6}41.2{-}892.4}\mathrm{~m})$ is defined by upper Miocene interbedded claystone, siltstone, and sandstone. Many of the siltston e and sandstone intervals are organized into a variety of massive an d stratified beds that include sedimentary structures such as paralle l laminations, cross-stratification, and contorted strata. There ar e also several massive beds of sandstone that contain pebble-size d mud clasts. The well-organized coarser intervals fine upward int o more massive claystone intervals and are interpreted as turbidite sequences. Several of the stratified beds are composed of foraminife r tests.  

Unit IV (892.4–1233.3 m) also had very low recovery $(15\%)$ . Thi s unit is composed of upper Miocene very dark greenish gray to dar k gray sandstone with dark brown to very dark gray claystone and siltstone intervals. Many of the intervals described in this unit contai n interlaminations of silt or sand within a prevailing claystone lithology. Similar to Unit III, sedimentary structures in many of th e sandstone and siltstone intervals are interpreted as turbidites. Th e claystone in some of the cores shows a distinctive color banding, which was observed as a pattern of alternating reddish brown, dar k greenish gray, and brownish gray. The color banding appears to b e associated with fining-upward grain sizes and varying levels of bioturbation. Sandstone intervals within this unit contain high percentages of potassium feldspar,  quartz, plagioclase, and mic a minerals, which may have been sourced from granitic rocks exposed along the southern margin of China.  

Unit V (middle–upper Miocene) was divided into Subunits V A $(1233.30{-}1272.10\ \mathrm{m})$ and VB $(1272.10{-}1310.98\ \mathrm{m})$ based on th e abundance of calcareous material. Subunit VA consists of dark reddish brown, dark greenish gray, and dusky red homogeneous, massive claystone with few sandstone and siltstone interbeds $\left(3{-}12\;\mathrm{cm}\right)$ thick). Subunit VB consists of dark reddish brown, reddish brown, and greenish gray intervals of claystone, nannofossil-rich claystone, claystone with biogenic carbonate, and clay-rich chalk. Intervals o f greenish gray color within Subunits VA and VB unit are interprete d as diagenetic alteration.  

Unit VI $(1310.98{-}1370.33\ \mathrm{m})$ is composed of middle Miocen e dark greenish gray massive silty claystone with biogenic carbonat e and dark gray sandstone. Unit VII $^{(1370.33-1379.10\,\mathrm{m})}$ comprises  a thin ( $30\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick) middle Miocene dusky red claystone. The lowermost $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ of this unit has a greenish gray color that marks a shar p horizontal contact with the igneous rocks below in Unit VIII. Th e pre-middle Miocene basalt in Unit VIII (1379.10−1529.0 m) contains some fractures that are filled with well-lithified claystone. Th e claystone contains authigenic carbonate, siliciclastic components, and rare nannofossils. The basalt intervals are sparsely intercalate d with dusky red claystone, with the basalt/sediment contacts ofte n associated with chilled, glassy margins. Some claystone interval s within the basalt unit show evidence of dolomitization in thin section.  

# Igneous petrology  

In Hole U1500B, we cored $149.9\mathrm{~m~}$ of igneous rocks below th e sedimentary section and recovered a total of $114.92\;\mathrm{m}$ of basalt. Th e aphanitic to porphyritic basalts are nonvesicular to moderately vesicular and glassy to hypocrystalline, with the latter ranging fro m cryptocrystalline to fine grained, making up an aphyric to highly olivine-plagioclase phyric microstructure. These basalts contain numerous $2{-}5~\mathrm{cm}$ thick chilled margins, many with preserved fres h glass, as well as occasional hyaloclastites with brecciated glass fragments mixed with sediment. The basalts comprise Unit VIII and ar e divided into two igneous subunits (1a and 1b) according to flo w boundaries to distinguish an upper massive lava flow sequenc e $(27.28\:\mathrm{m}$ thick) from a lower, predominantly pillow lava flow succession ( $122.62\;\mathrm{m}$ thick) with subordinate thin $(<\!6\;\mathrm{m})$ interbedded lobate, sheet, and massive lava flows. The pillow lobes are well preserved and are separated by chilled, glassy margins (identifyin g upper and lower chilled margins of individual pillows where possible) and also claystone. Plagioclase phenocrysts are found throughout these basalts with olivine being an occasional phenocryst. Modal abundances of olivine and plagioclase phenocrysts increas e downhole, reaching a peak between 1420 and $1470\;\mathrm{mbsf}.$ . Veins occur throughout Unit VIII and are predominantly filled with carbonates and Fe oxides/hydroxides, chlorites, zeolites, and silica, as well as sediment (Neptunian dikes). Veins usually show a sharp contac t with the surrounding host basalt and are either polycrystalline o r massive. Claystone is a ubiquitous phase in many carbonate-ric h veins, especially in pillow lava flows, and is usually found as ver y fine aggregates within carbonate veins or as centimeter-thick vein s with no preserved textures or structures. Red to green-red halo s usually surround the carbonate veins, which are related to the background alteration of interstitial glass, olivine, and occasionally plagioclase and clinopyroxene. Alteration of these basalts remain s slight overall, as evidenced by the minimal alteration of interstitial glass as well as the good preservation of plagioclase. Alteration intensity, however, does increase downhole.  

# Structural geology  

Tilted sedimentary bedding and deformation structures wer e observed in all lithostratigraphic units. Faults, tilted beds, folds, an d mud-clasts observed in Units I, II, and III are likely related to gravity-controlled deposition (e.g., debris flows, slumps, slides, etc.). Unit IV has low recovery and exhibits only a few tilted beds an d compaction faults. A total of 47 centimeter-scale faults were measured in the claystone of Units V, VI, and VII. Many of these fault s have slickensides and are likely related to clay compaction durin g lithification. Open fractures and veins are identified in the sparsel y to highly plagioclase phyric basalts of Unit VIII. There are no preferred orientations of these structures. Most of the veins are fille d by carbonate minerals, Fe oxides, sediment, and secondary minerals. Veins are often haloed by Fe oxide alteration. Vein connectivit y is variable; single veins, branched veins, and vein networks are observed. There is no mineral-preferred orientation. Although th e seismic profile across Site U1500 shows dipping reflectors in the basalt, we do not observe any clear paleohorizontal or dipping feature s within these lavas.  

# Biostratigraphy  

All core catcher samples were analyzed for calcareous nannofossil and foraminifer content. Additional samples were taken fro m the split-core sections when necessary to refine the ages betwee n core catcher samples. Preservation of microfossils varies from poo r to good. Overgrown as well as abundant broken fragments are common in the sediment sequences. The total abundance varies fro m barren to abundant, and most samples exhibit some degree of reworking.  

Although recovery is low and ${\sim}50\%$ of the samples are barren, the succession is apparently continuous and is tentatively assigne d to Miocene–late Oligocene age. The late/middle Miocene boundar y $(11.6\ \mathrm{Ma})$ can be placed between Samples 367-U1500B-37R-1, 40– $41~\mathrm{{cm}}$ , and 44R-CC. Both calcareous nannofossils and planktoni c foraminifers indicate an early Miocene to late Oligocene successio n from Cores 367-U1500B-46R through 56R. In the calcareous sandstone just above the basalt (Section 367-U1500B-56R-1), som e younger species, such as Praeorbulina circularis, Globigerinoide s subquadratus, and Orbulina suturalis (middle Miocene), are foun d together with early Miocene to late Oligocene typical planktoni c foraminiferal species (Catapsydrax dissimilis and Paragloborotali a opima). In the same sample, the nannofossil content is represente d by long-range species and cannot give a precise age for Core 56R. However, two samples from the veins and intrapillow fill of the basalts in Unit VIII contain poorly preserved calcareous nannofossil s and indicate an Oligocene age. The resolution of the age discrepancy in Core 56R requires further postcruise studies.  

# Geochemistry  

At Site U1500, measurements of organic and inorganic carbo n and nitrogen were conducted on one sample per sedimentary cor e that had relative high recovery, and headspace gas measurement s were taken for all sediment cores. In addition, four basalt sample s were analyzed for concentrations of major elements and severa l trace elements using inductively coupled plasma–atomic emissio n spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Headspace gas values do not exceed 1 5 ppmv and are mostly below the quantification limit. Carbonate contents are dominated by biogenic carbonate and vary between $_{<1}$ an d $40\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ , with higher values corresponding to the calcareous-ric h lithostratigraphic units. TOC and TOC/TN are low, averaging 0.1 4 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ and 4.6, respectively. ICP-AES analyses of basalts from Sit e U1500 indicate subalkaline mid-ocean-ridge basalt (MORB)-lik e compositions.  

# Paleomagnetism  

We conducted AF demagnetization of archive-half sections an d AF and thermal demagnetization of representative discrete samples. For the sedimentary samples, AF demagnetization effectivel y removed the drilling-induced overprint and provided inclinations. Inclination data from the sedimentary long core and discrete samples are in agreement, but because of discontinuous coring an d poor recovery in many cored intervals we are not able to correlat e these to the standard geomagnetic polarity timescale. The passthrough measurements of the basalts show effective removal of  a low-coercivity component; however, it is not clear that we have revealed the ChRM. The basalts sometimes show both positive an d negative inclinations upon stepwise AF treatments within a singl e igneous subunit. The basalts show a more complex pattern whe n progressive thermal demagnetization measurements are made o n discrete samples. The close association of negative inclinations, changes in magnetic susceptibility, and demagnetization behavio r with fractures in the cores points to the possibility of a secondar y chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) as the source of the reversed intervals in the basalt.  

# Petrophysics  

We conducted measurements of GRA bulk density, magneti c susceptibility, and NGR on whole-round cores and additional measurements on split cores and discrete samples, including thermal conductivity; PWC $P$ -wave velocity; porosity; and bulk, dry, an d grain density. In general, bulk densities, $P$ -wave velocities, and thermal conductivities increase with depth, whereas porosities decreas e with depth as a result of compaction and lithification. However, some properties, such as NGR or magnetic susceptibility, show local variations related to the specific lithology. A significant increas e in carbonate content in Subunit VB (1272–1311 m) causes a general decrease in NGR counts and only a slight decrease in the magneti c susceptibility values. Physical properties change significantly in th e basalts of Unit VIII $(1379\!-\!1529\mathrm{~m})$ ). Magnetic susceptibility value s are two orders of magnitude higher than in the sediment above an d vary depending on the degree of alteration. $P$ -wave velocity value s are also much higher, ranging between 4430 and $5710\;\mathrm{m/s}$ , wherea s porosity and NGR values are very low compared to the sedimen t above.  

# Correlation to seismic data  

We used physical property measurements on cores and sample s to correlate Site U1500 data with the available seismic reflectio n profile. We also used the Site U1500 density and PWC velocity dat a to create synthetic seismograms that provided additional constraints on the correlation. The TDR obtained for Site U1500 show s substantial agreement with that for Site U1499 as well as Site s U1431 and U1433; in contrast, the Site 1148 TDR exhibits highe r velocities in the deeper layers. The comparison between the seismi c reflectors and the variations in physical properties and litholog y characteristics using the computed Site U1500 TDR shows a goo d correlation between the high-amplitude seismic reflector at ${\sim}6.4~s$ two-way traveltime (TWT) and the top of basalts of Unit VIII.  

# Downhole measurements  

Three downhole logging tool strings were run in Hole U1500B;  a modified triple combo (sonic velocity, NGR, bulk density, resistivity, and caliper), the FMS-sonic (FMS resistivity images and caliper an d NGR), and the VSI (check shot and NGR). During the first run, th e tool string encountered an obstruction at $4946\;\mathrm{m}$ wireline depth below rig floor (WRF; ${\sim}1133\;\mathrm{m})$ ), and we were unsuccessful in gettin g the tool string to pass below this depth. We collected FMS dat a from ${\sim}1044\mathrm{\,m}$ uphole to the bottom of the casing $\left(842\,\mathrm{m}\right)$ . Althoug h the hole had many zones that were significantly enlarged, initial observations of the real-time FMS data indicate that some interval s exhibit relatively good caliper contact and should provide useful resistivity images. A seismic check shot survey with the VSI was abl e to successfully collect data at one depth in the open hole as well as a t the base of the casing. Because this was the last operation conducted during Expedition 367 and we only had a 1 day transit t o Hong Kong, data processing and full evaluation of the log data will be conducted after Expedition 367.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Our assessment of meeting the objectives thus far, at the end o f Expedition 367 (halfway through the overall South China Sea Rifte d Margin two-expedition program) is as follows.  

1. To determine the nature of the basement within critical crustal units across the COT of the SCS rifted margin in order to discriminate between different competing models of breakup at magmapoor rifted margins. Specifically, to determine if the subcontinental lithospheric mantle was exhumed during plate rupture.  

# We have partially completed this objective.  

We successfully obtained a very valuable, well-recovered, an d unique section of basalt from the base of Site U1500. RCB coring i n Hole U1500B penetrated $149.90\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of basaltic rocks (1379.10– $1529.00\mathrm{~m})$ and recovered $114.92\mathrm{~m~}(77\%)$ . Onboard preliminar y ICP element analyses done on four samples indicate that they ar e tholeiitic basalt, compositionally comparable to samples of MOR B that were cored during previous Expedition 349 close to the fossi l ridge. The basalt may represent a unique lava sequence that erupte d in a transitional or earliest seafloor spreading stage (embryoni c ocean regime).  

Postcruise studies of the Site U1500 basalt should yield compositional information to show if the basalt flows are typical MORB o r embryonic oceanic crust and age information to show whether the y are rift related or post-seafloor spreading. We can also evaluate i f there has been any contamination or mixing with crust or lavas of  a different composition.  

Coring at Site U1499, on Ridge A, did not reach the crystallin e basement. The deepest samples recovered there were pebble- an d cobble-sized clasts, inferred to be part of a poorly lithified succession of gravel whose matrix was only rarely preserved in the drille d cores. The sediment that composes many of the cobbles from th e gravel unit typically includes mineral and lithic fragments that likel y underwent multiple sedimentary cycles. The gravel may have bee n deposited in a pre- or synrift setting. However, because no underlying crystalline basement was recovered, and biostratigraphic dat a are sparse, we cannot currently constrain the deposition age of th e gravel within the context of basin evolution. Nevertheless, the transition from the gravel to chalk represents a fundamental change i n the sedimentary depositional environment. The postcruise determination of age and depositional setting of the cores from Sit e U1499,  including  the  gravel,  will  be  pivotal  to  completin g Objective 1.  

2. To determine the time lag between plate rupture and asthenospheric upwelling that allowed decompression melting to generate igneous ocean crust.  

# We have partially completed this objective.  

The tholeiitic basalt from Site U1500 and the overlying sedimen t will be dated. Nannofossils in the intrapillow fill of the basalts indicate an Oligocene age, implying that the basalt did not erupt befor e the Oligocene. This information will be refined by postcruise geochronology on the basalt and overlying sediment from both sites using a combination of dating methods (e.g., argon geochronology, detrital zircon geochronology, and detrital low-temperature thermochronologic dating). These results, combined with similar techniques used on the cores obtained by Expedition 368 in basemen t and sediment at other COT and/or Ridge C sites, will allow us t o establish the relative timing of depositional and structural events. This relative timing can be compared to the timing of seafloo r spreading in nearby ocean basins to constrain scenarios for the tectonic development of the SCS on both local and regional scales.  

3. To constrain the rate of extension and vertical crustal movements.  

This objective is on track to be completed by postcruise research using the samples we collected and those of Expedition 368, as well as integrating with existing seismic reflection data.  

For example, at Site U1500, tilting and faulting have affected th e basement reflector (top of the basalts) and overlying sedimentar y units. Additional postcruise study on volcanic fabric, fault history, and paleomagnetics as well as ages of the overlying growth-faulte d sediment are needed to calculate the net amount and timing of extension and subsidence that is recorded in the seismic reflectio n data. Similar calculations will be done for other sites. Drilling th e sedimentary sequences at Site U1499 will provide another set of information on rifting and breakup history through the postriftin g stage. Using a combination of age, porosity, lithology, density, an d biostratigraphy, we could calculate the extension rate and vertical subsidence rate. Through cooling history analysis of the basemen t at Site U1499, we can constrain more about the vertical crustal movements.  

4. To improve the understanding of the Cenozoic regional tectonic and environmental development of the Southeast Asia margin and SCS by combining Expedition 367/368 results with existing ODP/IODP sediment records and regional seismic data.  

This objective is partially completed, but we already have mad e major progress and have obtained important results.  

The postrift sediment cored during Expedition 367 provide d two major contributions to our understanding of the late Cenozoi c tectonic and environmental history of the northern margin of th e SCS. The first contribution involves new time-depth constraints o n some of the major seismic reflectors that are mapped regionall y throughout  the  basin.  This  was  done  by  integrating  micropaleontology ages, petrophysics, and borehole logging data with th e existing seismic reflection data. The second contribution involve s improvements to the lithostratigraphic record of the Miocene an d younger sediment. Two critical sedimentary successions were observed at both sites: an upper succession of hemipelagic and turbidite deposits and a lower succession of red claystone and chalk tha t was recovered near the bottom of each site. The upper successio n likely records processes that delivered sediment from the shallo w shelf of the northern SCS to the deeper parts of the basin. The abnormally high sedimentation rates, especially at Site U1500 (12–2 7 $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ for the upper Miocene sequence), indicate strong erosio n from source areas and efficient transport. The lower succession o f red clay and chalk may correlate to a basin-wide event related t o deep circulation of oxygenated water from the western Pacific, prio r to the closure of the Luzon Strait in the middle Miocene. Postcruis e research on the red clay will combine with observations of simila r pelagic sediment recovered in the central basin during Expeditio n 349 to constrain the environmental and tectonic evolution of th e Southeast Asia margin.  

Postcruise research using samples from Expedition 367 will continue to improve on these contributions to Objective 4. This research should be channeled into three general avenues:  

1. Correlation of the chronostratigraphic record among Sites U1499, U1500, the sites that will be drilled during Expedition 368, and previous IODP and ODP expeditions in the SCS;  

2. Provide new data (e.g., detrital zircon geochronology) to constrain the sedimentary provenance of the Miocene hemipelagite and turbidite deposits; and   
3. Reconstruct paleoceanographic conditions favorable to pelagic red clay deposition through geochemical and geophysical techniques.  

A complete set of observations relative to Objective 4 will us e the results of Expeditions 367 and 368 together with seismic stratigraphic correlations to improve our understanding of the regiona l tectonic and environmental development.  

# Operations  

The South China Sea Rifted Margin program was implemente d with operations scheduled at four sites during Expeditions 367 an d 368. During Expedition 367, we cored and logged at Sites U149 9 and U1500. The primary drilling operations during this expeditio n are summarized in this section and in Table T1 and Figures F6, F9, and F10.  

At Site U1499, we conducted operations in two holes. We core d with the APC/XCB systems in Hole U1499A from the seafloor t o $659.2\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $417.05\mathrm{~m~}(63\%)$ . We installed casing in Hol e U1499B to $651\mathrm{~m~}$ ; cored with the RCB from 655.0 to $1081.8\;\mathrm{m}$ , recovering $150.64\mathrm{~m~}$ $(35\%)$ ; and then conducted two wireline loggin g runs below the casing downhole to ${\sim}65\,\mathrm{~m~}$ above the base of th e hole.  

At Site U1500, we conducted operations in two holes with th e primary objective of sampling and logging the lowermost sedimen t and underlying basalt. We successfully penetrated from the seafloo r to the sediment/basalt contact at $1379\,\mathrm{m}$ and $150\;\mathrm{m}$ into the underlying basalt. The sedimentary section was not continuously cored, and recovery in the cored intervals was highly variable and rathe r poor $(30\%)$ . In contrast, core recovery in the basalt was excellen t $(77\%)$ . We collected log data in Hole U1500B from $842~\mathrm{m}$ (base o f casing) to a total depth of $1133\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

We knew we would have to install casing to achieve the deep objectives at Site U1500. Our operations in Hole U1500A were designed to provide information on formation characteristics an d drilling conditions so that we could decide the length of casing t o drill into the seafloor at the second, deep-penetration Hole U1500B. Given this purpose and the amount of time to drill the second, dee p hole, we did not core continuously in Hole U1500A. In Hol e U1500A, we  

• Drilled without coring from the seafloor to $378.2\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ,   
• Cored with the RCB from 378.2 to $494.6~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered 26.5 m $(23\%)$ ,   
• Drilled without coring from 494.6 to $641.2\;\mathrm{m};$ , and   
• Cored with the RCB from 641.2 to $854.6~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered 67.2 $\mathrm{m}\left(31\%\right)$ .  

# In Hole U1500B, we  

• Drilled a reentry funnel and $842\;\mathrm{m}$ of 10.75 inch casing into the seafloor,   
• Continuously cored the sediment sequence with the RCB from 846.0 to $1379.1\;\mathrm{m}$ $\mathrm{^533.1\;m}$ cored; $164.7\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $31\%$ ),   
• Continuously cored with the RCB $150\,\mathrm{m}$ into the underlying basalt from 1379.1 to $1529.0\;\mathrm{m}$ $114.92\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $77\%$ ), and   
• Collected downhole log data with three tool string logging runs from $842~\mathrm{m}$ (base of casing) to a total depth of $1133\;\mathrm{m}$ ( ${\sim}400\;\mathrm{m}$ above the base of the hole).  

# Hong Kong port call  

The South China Sea Rifted Margin Expedition 367 started a t $0812~\mathrm{h}$ (all times are $\mathrm{UTC}+8\ \mathrm{h}$ ) on 7 February 2017 with the firs t line ashore at the China Merchants Wharf in Hong Kong. The CoChief Scientists and IODP staff moved onto the ship and starte d crossover with their Expedition 366 counterparts. Initial loading o f incoming shipments began. The Expedition 367 scientists boarde d the ship in the morning of 8 February, got settled in their rooms, were introduced to life on board the JOIDES Resolution, and participated in an initial laboratory and ship safety tour. The scientist s were then introduced to the information technology on board th e ship, started to connect their computers to the shipboard network, and half of the science party went on a core-flow tour. Transfer o f incoming and outgoing shipments continued throughout the day. Arriving sea freight was partially loaded, along with fresh and refrigerated food products and 300 metric tons of potable water. All departing freight was moved to the pier. On 9 February, the day began with introductions of the Expedition 367 scientists and JOIDE S Resolution Science Operator (JRSO) shipboard staff followed by  a presentation of the expedition scientific objectives by the Co-Chie f Scientists. The rest of the day’s science meetings had to be postponed until the next day so that seven scientists could address issues with their travel documents. Major port call activities on  9 February included loading of 40 short tons of drilling mud, 987. 3 metric tons of marine gas oil, sea freight, and frozen food as well a s offloading of frozen shipments from the previous expedition. Because of a missed boat transfer in Shanghai, China, a shipment o f essential hardware (reentry cones, casing, and mud motors) was delayed until 10 February. Because of the time required to load thi s essential hardware, our departure was delayed by 1 day to 13 February.  

On 10 February, scientists were introduced to shipboard deliverables, met in lab groups with their JRSO technical staff team members, underwent the Captain’s introduction and safety orientation, and the other half of the science party went on a core-flow tour.  A Texas A&M University System film crew spent the day filming som e promotional videos and were escorted around the ship. In additio n to routine loading/offloading, the trucks with our delayed shipmen t of essential hardware started arriving in the late afternoon of 1 0 February. After carefully calculating the remaining work, arrangements were made with the agent and immigration authorities for  a departure at $1200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 February.  

On 11 February, the scientists were introduced to drilling/coring/logging operations, our shipboard Educator and Journalist gav e an overview of their plans for the expedition, and the Captain hel d the first fire and boat safety drill. In the afternoon, the scientist s shared their individual research interests for the expedition wit h each other. Loading of the essential hardware continued throughou t the day, and by the end of the day all casing had been secured in th e riser hold. All that remained of port call activities was to load fiv e flats of drill pipe and final securing of cargo prior to departure.  

We finished loading all remaining operations hardware on 1 2 February, including 288 joints of drill pipe. We also spooled ne w coring line onto the forward coring winch, offloaded trash prior t o sailing, secured all equipment for heading out to sea, and made necessary arrangements with port authorities for departing the nex t day.  

At $1000~\mathrm{h}$ , 13 February, immigration authorities boarded th e ship and the vessel was cleared for departure. The harbor pilot arrived on board just before noon, and the vessel was under way wit h the last line released at $1215\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 February. We proceeded to th e pilot station, and after a $7\,\textrm{n m i}$ transit the pilot disembarked a t $1248\,\mathrm{h}$ . Our 277 nmi transit to Site U1499 took $28.0\,\mathrm{h}$ with an average speed of $9.8\,\mathrm{kt}$ .  

# Site U1499  

# Hole U1499A  

After arriving at Site U1499 at $1615~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 February 2017, w e lowered the thrusters, deployed a seafloor beacon, assembled tw o extra stands for RCB coring later in the expedition, put together th e APC/XCB  bottom-hole  assembly  (BHA),  and  lowered  it  t o $3749.4\;\mathrm{m}$ below rig floor (mbrf) in preparation for coring. As eac h piece of the drill string was assembled, its length was measured an d its interior was verified to be unobstructed. The top drive wa s picked up, the entire string spaced out to place in preparation fo r starting coring, and a wiper pig was pumped through the drill strin g to clean rust and debris from the inside of the drill string. The calculated precision depth recorder (PDR) depth for the seafloor at Hol e U1499A was 3774.4 mbrf; we chose to place the bit at 3769 mbrf t o take the first core. An APC core barrel was lowered to the bit, an d coring in Hole U1499A started at $_{0930\,\mathrm{h}}$ on 15 February. Based on  a mudline core recovery of $7.5\;\mathrm{m}$ , we calculated the seafloor to be a t 3771.0 mbrf ( $3760.2\mathrm{~m~}$ below sea level [mbsl]). APC Cores 367- U1499A-1H through 18H penetrated to $162.4\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovere d $167.51\;\mathrm{m}\;(103\%)$ . All APC cores used nonmagnetic core barrels an d were orientated. Formation temperature measurements (APCT-3 ) were made while taking Cores 4H, 6H, 8H, 10H, 12H, and 14H.  

APC Cores 12H through 18H $(102.5{-}162.4\;\mathrm{m})$ encountered increasingly firm formation, and the core barrel did not fully penetrate the formation for many of them. Because of our primar y expedition objectives, we switched to XCB coring instead of first using the half-length APC (HLAPC) system, which would take twic e as long to penetrate the formation.  

XCB Cores 19X through 57X penetrated from 162.4 to $540.7\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered $227.37\mathrm{~m~}$ $(60\%)$ . XCB core recovery was highly bimodal. We had quite high core recovery in the fine-grained intervals (Cores 19X through 36X from 162.4 to $337.0\;\mathrm{m}$ with $158.99\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered $[91\%]$ and Cores 44X through 50X from 404.9 to $472.8\;\mathrm{m}$ with $65.19\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered $[96\%]$ ). We had very fast penetration rate s and extremely low recovery in unconsolidated sands (Cores 37 X through 43X from 337.0 to $404.9\;\mathrm{m}$ with $1.37\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered $[2\%]$ an d Cores 51X through 57X from 472.8 to $540.7\mathrm{~m~}$ with $1.82~\mathrm{m}$ recovered $[3\%]$ ). One exception was Core $25\mathrm{X}$ , which came back wit h only $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ of core, but the core liner appeared to have had sedimen t in it, so we inferred that the sediment was fine grained, and that i t fell out of the core barrel while this was being retrieved.  

Once we encountered the unconsolidated sands, we started circulating mud sweeps (30 bbl at 337.0, 346.7, 375.8, 404.9, 443.7, 472.8, 492.2, 511.6, and $531.0\ \mathrm{m}^{\mathrm{~\,~}}$ ). While making a connection a t $492.2\;\mathrm{m},$ , the drill string became stuck and could not be rotated. W e circulated an additional 50 bbl of mud, were able to regain rotation, and resumed XCB coring in Hole U1499A. Cores 58X through 67 X penetrated from 540.7 to $637.7\;\mathrm{m}\;(20.37\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $21\%$ ). For th e first eight cores (58X through 65X), the bit penetrated very quickl y through $77.6~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered only $4.16\mathrm{~m~}(5\%)$ , so we inferred tha t the sediment is predominantly unconsolidated sand. Core 66X ha d slower penetration and $100\%$ recovery in the finer grained formation. However, the penetration rate increased again in Core 67X, indicating that we encountered sand again. The last core on 1 9 February (Core 68X) also cut very quickly and had almost arrive d back on the rig floor $\mathrm{\sim}100~\mathrm{mbrf})$ when the low-clutch diaphrag m in the drawworks failed at $2245\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 February; we could not rais e the drill string. We secured the drill string and circulated, rotated, and pumped a mud sweep every hour to keep the drill string fro m getting stuck while repairing the ruptured diaphragm. After the 24. 5 h it took to repair the drawworks, we were finally able to open th e drill string and get Core 68X out of the drill string at $2320\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 2 0 February. We had suspected it would be empty because it cored ver y quickly through inferred sand, but it also had been sitting in the drill string for a full day. Although coring recovery was quite variable, very close to XCB coring refusal, and the finer grained formation w e did recover was getting quite hard, we wanted to penetrate a fe w more cores to verify an appropriate formation to set the base of th e casing to be deployed in our next hole (firm formation, not sand).  

Cores 69X through 71X penetrated quite slowly from 647.4 t o $659.2\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $1.8\;\mathrm{m}$ of hard sedimentary rock; we decide d this was an appropriate interval for the base of the casing. Th e driller then circulated the entire hole with mud to minimize risks o f hole problems as we pulled the drill string out of the hole. W e started pulling the drill string out of Hole U1499A at $0815\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 1 February. We kept the top drive installed until the bit was at $299\;\mathrm{m},$ above the uppermost interval of unconsolidated sand. The bi t cleared the seafloor at $1230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 February and arrived on the ri g floor at $2015~\mathrm{h},$ , ending Hole U1499A. APC/XCB coring in Hol e U1499A penetrated $659.2\mathrm{~m~}$ . As mentioned above, core recover y was highly variable (formation dependent), and core recovery was  a total of $417.05\mathrm{~m~}$ $(63\%)$ . We suspect that unconsolidated sand accounted for the poor recovery. The overall drilling, coring, and formation information from Hole U1499A was used for planning th e casing installation for the second hole to achieve our deep-corin g and logging objectives.  

# Hole U1499B  

We offset the ship $20\,\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1499A and conducted required routine rig servicing (drill line slip and cut). At $2345\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 1 February, we started preparing the rig floor for assembling the reentry cone and $651\,\mathrm{~m~}$ long casing to be drilled into the seafloor i n Hole U1499B.  

We spent all of 22 February and the first part of 23 February assembling the 10.75 inch casing and the drilling string we would us e to drill it into the seafloor. This included  

• Moving the mud skirt over the moonpool,   
• Assembling $651\,\mathrm{m}$ of 10.75 inch casing, lowering it through, and latching it into the mud skirt, and   
• Assembling a 9.875 inch tricone bit, underreamer set to 12.75 inches, and mud motor and lowering them through the casing hung off in the moonpool.  

At $0430\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 February, we finished putting together the fina l parts of the drilling assembly. This included attaching the uppe r part of the casing running tool (which contains the hydraulic releas e tool [HRT]) and attaching the reentry funnel. We started lowerin g the entire $651\;\mathrm{m}$ long casing string and drilling assembly to the seafloor and deployed the camera system at $1115\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 February t o monitor the reentry funnel while the casing was being drilled int o the seafloor. When the pilot bit that extends $2.71~\mathrm{m}$ below the casing shoe was just above the seafloor, the drillers measured the pressures at various pump rates to get information to compare to thos e when we start penetrating the formation. Drilling in Hole U1499 B started at $1535\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 February. While drilling the casing into th e seafloor, we circulated $25~\mathrm{bbl}$ mud sweeps at 152.6, 327.8, 356.98,  

493.1, $619.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . We continued to drill the casing into the seafloo r until the mud skirt landed on the seafloor.  

We deployed the go-devil to activate the casing running tool, which released the casing at $2300~\mathrm{h}$ on 24 February. We retrieve d the entire drilling assembly, with the bit clearing the seafloor a t $0230~\mathrm{h}$ on 25 February, and the bit arrived back on the rig floor a t $1230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 February. After taking apart the drilling assembly an d flushing the mud motor, underreamer, and bit with freshwater, w e began preparing the rig floor for RCB coring. We started assembling the RCB BHA at $1430\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 February, and the rest of the da y was spent lowering it to the seafloor. At $2230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 February, th e subsea camera was deployed. Once the RCB bit and camera reache d the seafloor, we started searching for the Hole U1499B reentry funnel at $0215~\mathrm{h}$ on 26 February. After we were unable to find it relatively quickly (as is usual), we initiated an expanding $5\,\textrm{m}$ gri d search. After just over $6\;\mathrm{h},$ , we eventually found the reentry funne l cone. It was clearly visible inside a small crater of sediment locate d about half-way $\left(\sim\!10\,\textrm{m}\right)$ back toward and a little south of Hol e U1499A to the west. Also, the top of the reentry funnel appeared t o be close to level with the top of the cuttings pile. After only $10\;\mathrm{min}$ of maneuvering, we reentered Hole U1499B at $0825\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 February, started lowering the RCB bit down through the casing, and recovered the camera system. As the bit was being lowered, i t encountered sediment inside the casing at $571~\mathrm{m},\,80~\mathrm{m}$ above th e casing shoe. This was assumed to be sand which was drawn bac k into the casing as the drilling stinger assembly (with pilot bit, underreamer, and mud motor) used to drill the casing in was withdraw n from the casing. We picked up the top drive, deployed a core barre l at $1230\,\mathrm{h},$ and washed back to the bottom of the hole at $655\;\mathrm{m}$ $\mathrm{4~m}$ below the base of the casing). We circulated $30\,\mathrm{bbl}$ of mud, retrieve d the core barrel (empty), and at $2230~\mathrm{h}$ on 26 February, we starte d RCB coring in Hole U1499B.  

On 27 February, RCB coring in Hole U1499B penetrated fro m 655.0 to $790.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ with an overall recovery of $41.44\mathrm{~m~}$ (Cores 367- U1499B-2R through 15R; $31\%$ ). However, recovery continued to b e highly variable and formation dependent. In fine-grained intervals, we had higher recovery $(53\%)$ and steady, relatively slow penetratio n rates (Cores 2R through 3R from 655.0 to $674.4\,\mathrm{~m},$ , Cores 9 R through 10R from 722.9 to $742.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , and Cores 13R through 15 R from 752.0 to $790.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ ). In other intervals, inferred to consist o f loosely consolidated coarse-grained sand, we had very low recover y $(0.7\%)$ and very quick penetration rates. The drillers noted these intervals at 672.9–727.6 and $739.3\substack{-759.7\,\mathrm{m}}$ , which correspond mostl y with Cores 4R through 8R $(674.4–722.0\ \mathrm{m})$ and 11R (742.3–752. 0 m). We circulated 30 bbl mud sweeps at 684.1, 713.2, 742.3, 761.7, and $781.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . At first light on 27 February, a boat (M/V Taikoo) wit h critical spares for the drawworks clutch arrived on site, and th e transfer was completed.  

We continued RCB coring from 790.8 to $897.5\mathrm{~m~}$ (Cores 16 R through 26R; $72.33\,\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered; $68\%$ ) and circulated 30 bbl mu d sweeps at 810.2, 839.3, and $878.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Each of these cores (16 R through 26R) took from 20 to $60\ \mathrm{min}$ to cut. Another fast-drillin g zone from 825.0 to $834.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ was also noted by the drillers. Afte r Core 26R, however, we encountered a substantial formation whe n Core 27R took over $2~\mathrm{{h}}$ $205\ \mathrm{min})$ ) to cut. RCB Cores 27R throug h 29R continued in very hard formation. These cores took 120–20 5 min to cut, penetrated $29.1\;\mathrm{m}$ from 897.5 to $926.6\;\mathrm{m}$ , and recovere d $16.43\;\mathrm{m}$ $(56\%)$ . However, Core 30R took only $45~\mathrm{min}$ to cut (as opposed to 205, 130, and $120\,\mathrm{min}$ for the cores just above). In addition, when the bit was being raised off bottom to recover the core, th e drill string became stuck momentarily, so we circulated $30~\mathrm{bbl}$ o f mud, and hole conditions improved. The penetration time for Cor e 31R went back up $\mathrm{{}^{130\,m i n}})$ , but the drill string became temporaril y stuck again. This time we circulated $90\;\mathrm{bbl}$ of mud, and coring wa s able to continue.  

RCB Cores 31R through 38R penetrated $77.6~\mathrm{m}$ from 936.3 t o $1013.9\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $8.66\;\mathrm{m}\;(11\%)$ . It took from 2 to ${>}3\,\mathrm{h}$ to cu t each core. The drill string became stuck momentarily while cuttin g Core 33R. We circulated 30 bbl of mud after cutting Cores 32R an d 35R through 37R.  

Because we decided to stop coring to change the RCB bit to cor e deeper and the bit had accumulated 40.6 rotating hours, we circulated the cuttings out of the hole with $70\,\mathrm{bbl}$ of mud after Core 38R. Before pulling the bit up into the casing and out of the hole, we firs t raised the bit up to $780\ \mathrm{m},$ , circulated the hole with 35 bbl of mud, and then filled the uncased (open) part of the hole with 235 bbl o f heavy mud $\mathrm{(11.0\;1b/gal;}$ ; barite). This was intended to help stabiliz e the hole while we changed the bit and reduce the amount of fill w e might encounter when we reentered the hole to resume RCB coring. This was also expected to give us some indication of the hole conditions we might encounter for planned downhole logging after coring had finished. Because we had some challenges locating the hol e the first time we reentered, we lowered the subsea camera system t o observe the reentry funnel as we pulled the bit out of the hole. While we were still in the hole, we could see the drill pipe clearly i n the center of the crater created by the cuttings mound. Although th e reentry funnel’s concentric black and white stripes were not visible, we didn’t anticipate problems finding and reentering the hole. Th e bit was pulled out of the hole at $1655~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 March, and we spen t the rest of the day recovering the drill string (except for a $0.5\;\mathrm{h}$ repair of the pipe racker).  

We finished recovering the drill string at $0215\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 March, attached a new RCB bit (C-7), lowered it to the seafloor, and then deployed the subsea camera system at $0915~\mathrm{h}$ . We paused rig floo r operations from 0915 to $1045\,\mathrm{h}$ to conduct required routine rig servicing (drill line slip and cut) before we resumed lowering the drill bit to the seafloor. At $1345\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 March, the bit and camera were i n position, and we were able to immediately see the reentry funnel i n the center of the cuttings pile caldera. It took us $22\;\mathrm{min}$ to positio n the bit over the funnel and reenter Hole U1499B at $1407~\mathrm{h}$ on  4 March. We retrieved the camera and lowered the bit down throug h the $651\,\mathrm{m}$ of casing to $848.1\;\mathrm{m}$ in the open hole. We installed the to p drive and circulated/rotated until $987~\mathrm{m}$ , only ${\sim}27~\mathrm{m}$ from the bottom of the hole, before the bit encountered any resistance. This wa s easily penetrated, and we only encountered $1\,\mathrm{m}$ of fill on the botto m of the hole. At the end of the day, we pumped 40 bbl of mud to clea r cuttings from the hole and retrieved the core barrel that was i n place while getting back to the bottom of the hole. We resumed RC B coring from $1013.9\,\mathrm{m}$ at $0115\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 March. Cores 39R through 43 R penetrated from 1013.9 to $1062.4\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $4.1~\mathrm{m}$ $(4\%)$ . W e pumped 30 bbl of mud after each of these cores.  

At $0100\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 6 March, Core 44R arrived on the rig floo r $(1062.4–1072.1\;\mathrm{m};0.45\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $5\%$ ), and we dropped the nex t core barrel to start cutting Core 45R. While this core was being cut, there were periods of erratic torque, high pump pressures, an d some short times when the drill string could not be rotated. Th e driller raised and lowered the drill string and was able to keep coring. Just after we put the core line into the drill string to retriev e Core 45R, the pipe became stuck. For ${\sim}45~\mathrm{min}$ , we worked the drill string until it was freed at $0615\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 March. We then removed th e core line from the drill string. We raised the bit back up to $994\mathrm{~m~}$ and worked to clean out the hole. Eventually at $1045~\mathrm{h}$ , condition s had improved enough that we retrieved Core 45R at $1150\,\mathrm{~h~}$ $(1072.1{-}1081.8~\mathrm{m};\,0.09~\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $0.9\%$ ). We spent the next $^{9\mathrm{~h~}}$ attempting to wash, ream, drill, and circulate our way back to bottom. However, we never were able to get below $\mathord{\sim}1053\mathrm{~m~}$ $\left.\sim\!30\mathrm{~m~}\right.$ above the bottom of the hole) without the drill string getting stuck. At $2045\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 March, we decided that further attempts to get bac k to the bottom of the hole and core deeper were not reasonable, s o we started to prepare the hole for wireline logging. We circulated 5 0 bbl of mud to clean cuttings out of the hole, retrieved the cor e (wash) barrel that was in place during the hole remediation efforts, and lowered the rotary shifting tool on the coring line to release th e bit in the hole.  

After the bit was released in the bottom of the hole at $0000\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 7 March, we raised the end of the pipe from 1052.7 to $877.3\;\mathrm{m}$ an d shifted the mechanical bit release sleeve back into the circulatin g position. We then raised the end of the pipe to $780~\mathrm{m}$ and pumpe d 235 bbl of heavy mud into the hole to help maintain good hole conditions for logging. At $1030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 March, we had raised the end o f pipe back inside the casing to $85.1~\mathrm{m}$ and started to prepare the ri g floor for logging. Our first logging tool string consisted of the resistivity, velocity, density, and NGR tools. We started lowering it a t $1345~\mathrm{h}$ on 7 March. The tool string was able to reach $1020\ \mathrm{m},$ an d we successfully logged from that depth up to the base of the casin g at $651\;\mathrm{m}$ . Log data were also collected up the casing and drill pipe t o the seafloor. The tool string arrived back at the rig floor at $2215\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 7 March. Based on the first logging run results, we decided to conduct a second logging run with the FMS and NGR tools.  

We assembled the FMS and NGR tools and started lowerin g them at $0130~\mathrm{h}$ on 8 March. The tool string was able to reach 101 0 m and we were able to make two passes of the open hole up to th e base of the casing at $651\;\mathrm{m}$ . Initial results showed that we collecte d some excellent data in intervals with good borehole diameter. Th e tool string arrived back on the rig floor at $0925\,\mathrm{h},$ , and all of the logging equipment was off the rig floor at $1030~\mathrm{h}$ on 8 March. W e pulled the end of the drill string out of Hole U1499B at $1120\;\mathrm{h},$ recovered the seafloor beacon, and started the transit to Site U1500 i n dynamic positioning mode just before $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 March. While i n transit, we continued to recover the drill string (arrived back on th e rig floor at $1830\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 March) as well as assembled a new RCB bi t and started lowering it to the seafloor. We spent a total of 22.1 day s at Site U1499.  

# Site U1500  

# Hole U1500A  

At $0415\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 March 2017, we deployed the subsea camera system and observed the bit tag the seafloor to establish the wate r depth $(3801.7\,\mathrm{mbsl})$ ). After recovering the camera system, we starte d drilling without coring in Hole U1500A at $0935\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 March. Unfortunately, at $1930\,\mathrm{h}$ with the bit at $340.5\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , the drawworks clutc h diaphragm that had been replaced earlier in the expedition failed. The clutch diaphragm was repaired with one of the new diaphragm s that had been delivered to the ship by boat on 27 February. As soo n as it was fixed $\mathrm{[0930\h}$ on 10 March), we resumed drilling withou t coring from 340.5 to $378.2~\mathrm{m}$ . While drilling down, we pumped 3 0 bbl mud sweeps at 350.2 and $378.2~\mathrm{m}$ . We recovered the center bi t and started RCB coring at $1245\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 March. Cores 367-U1500A2R through 13R penetrated from 378.2 to $494.6\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovere d $26.5\;\mathrm{m}\;(23\%)$ . We drilled without coring from 494.6 to $641.2~\mathrm{m}$ an d then resumed RCB coring to the total depth of $854.6~\mathrm{m}$ .  

Except for a few short intervals (Cores 2R through 4R fro m 378.2 to $407.3\:\mathrm{m},$ , Cores 24R through 27R from 728.5 to $767.3\,\mathrm{m}$ , an d  

Cores 35R through 36R from 835.2 to $844.9~\mathrm{m}]$ ), core recovery wa s quite poor. In contrast, the cores that took $15~\mathrm{min}$ or more to cu t had better recovery (from 0.88 to $8.93~\mathrm{m};$ average recovery $=59\%$ ). We pumped frequent mud sweeps through the entire cored interval. A formation change occurred at $728.5~\mathrm{~m~}$ with Cores 24 R through 27R $(728.5\mathrm{-}767.3\mathrm{~m})$ , taking $30{-}50\ \mathrm{min}$ to cut with substantially improved recovery $(32.1\ \mathrm{m};\ 83\%)$ ) of clay/claystone. W e thought this would be a good formation for the base of our planne d Hole U1500B casing until Core 28R once again reentered a fast-penetrating, low-recovery interval inferred to be sand. Following this, Cores 29R through 36R penetrated from 770.0 to $854.6~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $27.6\mathrm{~m~}$ $(36\%)$ . The majority of the core recovered was i n Cores 30R, 33R, 35R, and 36R $\left(25.29\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ . For the other cores, penetration rates were, once again, very fast and recovery very low $(2\%-$ $9\%$ ; inferred to be less consolidated silt/sand). When the last tw o cores (35R and 36R) encountered stable, well-consolidated formation, we decided we had met our primary objective of determinin g formation conditions at Site U1500 and an appropriate casing se t point for our next hole at this site. So, we pulled the bit out of th e hole, and it cleared the seafloor at $2330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 March. Based on th e Hole U1500A information (cores, drilling, and borehole conditions), we decided that to achieve our deep-coring and logging objectives at this site, we would drill $842~\mathrm{m}$ of casing into the seafloo r at Hole U1500B. This placed the base of the casing in the relativel y fine grained stable formation recovered in the last two cores an d would isolate the multiple intervals of unstable formation above (inferred sand/silt). After the bit arrived back on the rig floor at $0640\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 March, we disassembled the bit, cleared the rig floor, and conducted required routine rig servicing (drill line slip and cut).  

# Hole U1500B  

From 0900 on 14 March to $0400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 March we prepared th e casing running tool (HRT), assembled $842\mathrm{~m~}$ of 10.5 inch casing, and latched it into the mud skirt sitting on the moonpool doors. W e then assembled and tested a $846\,\mathrm{m}$ long drilling assembly compose d of a 9.875 inch tricone bit, underreamer (set to 12.75 inches), an d mud motor. This drilling assembly was lowered through the casing, the HRT attached to the top of it, and then secured to the mu d skirt/casing. At $1130\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 March, the entire system was lowere d through the moonpool and then to the seafloor. We deployed th e subsea camera system at $2015~\mathrm{h}$ on 15 March and installed the to p drive shortly thereafter (2315 h).  

At $0035~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 March, we started drilling the casing into th e seafloor at Hole U1500B. Along the way, we circulated 30 bbl o f mud at multiple depths (335.6, 374.6, 394.0, 423.1, 452.2, 481.4, 510.6, 539.6, 568.8, 597, 627, 656, 685, 714, 744, 774, 802, and 83 2 m). Drilling the casing into the seafloor proceeded smoothly until ${\sim}779\mathrm{~m~}$ ( $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 March) when we observed the mud skirt an d reentry funnel rotate very quickly indicating that torque had buil t up in the drill string and then suddenly released. At the same time, we also observed that the penetration rate slowed down substantially. We suspected that one or more of the underreamer arms ha d lost its cutting structure (roller cone). Our options at this point wer e limited. We could continue to drill the bit in to the full depth or pull it back to the ship, shorten the casing string, and try to drill that in. We had only ${\sim}63\mathrm{~m~}$ more of penetration until the casing was full y installed. Based on the coring information from Hole U1500A, much of this interval was expected to be loosely consolidated fastpenetration formation with only a couple of short intervals of fir m formation. So, we continued to drill in. Although penetration rate s slowed quite a bit, we were able to continue advancing the entir e system until a reduction in drill string weight indicated that th e mud skirt had landed on the seafloor at $1740\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 March (Figur e F10). This fact led us to suspect that if the underreamer cutters ha d come off, they likely had been pushed off into the borehole wall behind the casing. We dropped the go-devil to activate the HRT, an d the drilling assembly released from the casing at ${\sim}1833\mathrm{~h~}$ on 1 7 March. We raised the bit and underreamer back up to $841.4~\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , inside the casing, and filled the annulus between the casing and th e drill pipe with $100~\mathrm{bbl}$ of mud to inhibit sand from being sucke d back up into the casing as we pulled the drilling assembly out of th e hole (as previously happened at Hole U1499B). We then pulled th e drill string out of the hole. After the bit cleared the seafloor $(2220\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 March), we conducted a short survey of the reentry system, which was barely visible in the cutting mound.  

Once we finished recovering the drilling assembly and th e underreamer arrived back on the rig floor ( $\mathrm{{0730}\,h}$ on 18 March), w e observed that all of its cutting structures were still attached. However, one of them was clearly damaged (failed bearing assembly) an d likely the cause of the torque event and subsequent reduction i n penetration rate. We started assembling the RCB BHA at $0915\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 18 March and lowered it to the seafloor. We deployed the subse a camera system at $1615\,\mathrm{h}$ , started searching for the Hole U1500B reentry funnel, and after only $6~\mathrm{min}$ of maneuvering we reentere d Hole U1500B at $1845\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 March. We recovered the camera system, lowered the bit through the casing, and installed the top driv e in preparation for RCB coring. We lowered the bit into the ope n hole below the end of the casing $\left(842\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ , found only $1\;\mathrm{m}$ of fill, circulated 25 bbl of mud displacing the heavy mud out of the hole, an d started RCB coring at $0115\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 March. The uppermost $5.3\;\mathrm{m}$ o f the first core taken after installing the casing (Core 2R) was composed primarily of heavy mud mixed with some cuttings.  

Overall core recovery in Hole U1500B was very poor over a significant interval of the sedimentary section, particularly from 893. 8 to $1233.3\mathrm{~m~}$ (lithostratigraphic Unit IV). Cores from this interva l (Cores 7R through 41R) penetrated $339.5\,\mathrm{m}$ and recovered only 51. 3 $\textrm{m}(15\%)$ . For cores in this interval that cut quickly $\langle\pm15\mathrm{\min}\rangle$ , cor e recovery was only $7\%$ , and we inferred the formation is likely dominated by unconsolidated sand/silt. In contrast, recovery in core s that took longer to penetrate $(20{-}55\ \mathrm{min})$ ) was higher $(41\%)$ and recovered sandstone with claystone and siltstone interbeds.  

While cutting Core 42R, we encountered a substantial formation change at $1235\;\mathrm{m},$ , and core recovery increased to $66\%$ for Core s 42R through 45R. The time to cut Cores 43R through 45R also increased to $40{-}80\;\mathrm{min}$ . The formation change is also reflected in th e recovered cores that are dusky red claystones with greenish alteration zones as well as a few interbedded sandstone layers. Cores 46 R through 50R penetrated from 1272.1 to $1320.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovere d $30.2\;\mathrm{m}\;(62\%)$ . Although it took quite a long time to cut each of thes e cores $(1.8{-}3.8\ \mathrm{h})$ ), the penetration rate was very smooth and hol e conditions were quite good. Cores 51R through 57R then penetrated from 1320.6 to $1388.5\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered $32.4\mathrm{~m~}(48\%)$ . Afte r Core 51R took $100\;\mathrm{min}$ to cut, the next five cores (52R through 56R ) penetrated quite quickly; all but one took only $5{-}25\ \mathrm{min}$ , and ha d relatively lower recovery $(31\%)$ . Core 57R cut slowly $(3.6\,\mathrm{~h~})$ bu t smoothly and consistently and recovered $8.34~\mathrm{m}$ that is almost entirely basalt. Cores 58R through 60R continued in basalt penetratin g from 1388.5 to $1415.9\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovering $19.9\mathrm{~m~}(73\%)$ . These core s also cut slowly $(4.3{-}5.4\mathrm{~h)}$ but mostly smoothly and consistently. Because we had 52 rotating hours on the bit and we wanted to cor e and log deeper in Hole U1500B, we decided to retrieve the dril l string to change the RCB bit. We circulated cuttings out of the hole, raised the bit up to $1242~\mathrm{m}$ and pumped 235 bbl of weighted (11. 0 $1\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{gal})$ mud into the hole to stabilize it while we changed the bit. W e then pulled the drill string out of the hole (removing the top drive a t $1066.0\;\mathrm{m})$ , and the bit cleared the seafloor at $2340\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 March.  

Before we recovered the drill string, we paused operations for  2 h to conduct routine rig servicing (drill line slip and cut). The bi t arrived on the rig floor in good shape at $0845~\mathrm{h}$ on 26 March. W e attached a new RCB bit for basement coring (C-7) and lowered i t toward the seafloor. Once the bit was at the seafloor along with th e camera system, we started searching for the reentry funnel at $1730\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 March. After a short search, we saw streaks of cuttings on th e outside of the mound of drill cuttings around the hole. We move d the bit over the clearly visible reentry funnel and reentered Hol e U1500B at $1755~\mathrm{h}$ . We lowered the bit through the casing and int o the open hole below. As we were doing this we had the float valv e shifted into the open position, which allows water to easily pas s through the bit. If it’s in the closed position we have to stop periodically to fill the drill string with water as we lower it. As we lowere d the bit, it encountered a bridge at ${\sim}1067\;\mathrm{m},$ and sediment appeare d to block flow through the bit. We then pulled up a little bit and deployed a core barrel to try to clear the obstruction in the bit and t o close the float valve so we could wash/drill back down the hole t o resume RCB coring.  

The core barrel that we dropped to clear the obstruction in th e bit did not land properly at the bottom of the drill string. We deployed the core line to retrieve the core barrel and found that it ha d landed ${\sim}42~\mathrm{m}$ above the bottom of the drill string. We made thre e unsuccessful attempts to pull the core barrel back out. We the n raised the bit from 1018 to $454\;\mathrm{m}$ inside the casing (above the top o f the weighted mud) and still could not free the core barrel and reestablish circulation. We made two more unsuccessful attempts wit h the bit at $249\,\mathrm{m}$ and then above the seafloor. At $1530\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 March, we decided the only way to fix this problem was to retrieve the entire drill string. At 0000 on 28 March the bit had reached $58~\mathrm{m}$ below the rig floor, and we spent most of the early morning of 2 8 March recovering the final parts of BHA on the rig floor and cleaning out sediment (cuttings, sand, etc.) that filled the lowermost ${\sim}40$ m of it. The sediment had worked its way above the core barrel. A t $0700~\mathrm{h}$ on 28 March, we started reassembling the RCB BHA an d lowering it to the seafloor. We deployed the camera system, dropped a core barrel to close the float valve, and started to positio n the bit over the reentry funnel at $1830\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 March. We reentere d Hole U1500B at $1930\,\mathrm{h},$ recovered the camera system, and lowere d the bit down to $804.3~\mathrm{m}$ in the casing. At $2315\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 March, w e started to install the top drive in preparation for lowering the bi t through the base of the casing $\left(842\,\mathrm{m}\right)$ and into the open hole below. However, at $0045\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 March we discovered a problem with th e top drive (one of the counter-balance cylinders). After fixing it, a t $0400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 March we resumed lowering the bit. After exiting th e base of the casing and down into the open hole, the bit started encountering some resistance at $\mathord{\sim}1066\,\mathrm{m}$ . We washed from there bac k down to the bottom of the hole at $1415.9\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , pumping 30 bbl of mu d at 1008, 1115, 1203, 1232.4, and $1300.52\mathrm{~m~}$ . At the bottom of th e hole, we pumped $35\;\mathrm{bbl}$ of weighted $\left(11.0\;\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{gal}\right)$ mud to clean th e cuttings out of this deep hole. We planned to continue usin g weighted mud in Hole U1500B as we penetrated deeper. We recovered the core barrel that was in place while getting the bit back t o bottom (ghost Core 61G; $2.36~\mathrm{m}$ recovered), deployed a fresh cor e barrel at $1745~\mathrm{h}$ on 29 March, and resumed RCB coring. Core 62 R arrived on the rig floor at $2230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 March after penetrating 2. 5 m (1415.9–1418.4 m) and recovering $2.36\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(94\%)$ . This shorte r penetration was necessary to adjust pipe connections at the ri g floor.  

Although Core 63R recovered $3.6~\mathrm{m}$ of very nice basalt, it too k much longer to cut $(8\,\mathrm{h})$ and the core pieces had become stuck inside the plastic core liner and in the core catcher sub. It is likely tha t the recovered material came from the upper part of the cored interval, then jammed, and the rest of the core got ground up, washe d away, and never entered the core barrel. This may have also contributed to the slow penetration rate (at least after the core jamme d off). So, we decided to cut only half-length cores. Cores 64 R through 73R then penetrated from 1428.0 to $1475.9\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered $40.0\;\mathrm{m}\;(84\%)$ . Although the cores took from 2.3 to $4.7\,\mathrm{h}$ to cut, the recovery and core quality of the basalts was excellent.  

Because the bit had accumulated $44\,\mathrm{h}$ of rotating time, hole conditions remained good, and we planned to continue to core deepe r into basement and collect downhole logs, we decided to stop corin g to change the bit. After cutting Core 73R, we circulated cuttings ou t of the hole with two 35 bbl weighted mud sweeps and raised the bi t to $1387.8\;\mathrm{m}$ where we removed the top drive. We then raised the bi t to $1242.1\;\mathrm{m}$ and filled the hole with 235 bbl of weighted mud to stabilize it while we changed the bit. Once the mud was in place, w e raised the bit to just below the seafloor $(45.7\;\mathrm{m})$ and deployed a secondary reentry (free-fall) funnel on top of the first one that we previously drilled into the seafloor with the casing (Figure F10). Thi s secondary reentry funnel was intended to block the large pile of cuttings around the hole from falling back in while we continued ou r Hole U1500B operations. After the funnel was dropped at $2208\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 1 April, we continued to circulate to minimize the amount of cuttings in the seafloor structure while the secondary funnel landed. We deployed the subsea camera system at $2330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 April so tha t we could observe the bit being withdrawn from Hole U1500B.  

At $0100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 April, we observed the bit being pulled out of th e hole with the subsea camera system and then recovered the dril l string with the bit arriving back on the rig floor at $0840~\mathrm{h}$ . We installed a new bit more appropriate for hard formations (C-9), lowered it to the seafloor, and started positioning the ship to reente r Hole U1500B at $2000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 April. We reentered the hole at $2100\,\mathrm{h}$ , recovered the camera system, and lowered the bit down through th e casing.  

Before lowering the new RCB bit into the open hole below th e casing, we paused for $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ to conduct routine rig servicing (drill lin e slip and cut, lubricate the rig). Once in the open hole, the bit encountered some resistance (bridge/ledge) at ${\sim}947\mathrm{~m~}$ and we reame d from there to ${\sim}950\ \mathrm{m}$ . The bit passed quite easily from there to th e bottom of the hole where ${\sim}0.5~\mathrm{m}$ of hard fill was drilled out. Afte r circulating two 35 bbl mud sweeps, we recovered the core barre l that was in place while getting back to the bottom of the hole. W e resumed RCB coring from $1475.9\,\mathrm{m}$ at $1730\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 April. Cores 74 R through 83R penetrated from 1475.9 to $1529.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovere d $39.8\mathrm{~m~}(75\%)$ .  

The last core of Expedition 367 (Core 83R) arrived on the ri g floor at $1530\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 April. We stopped coring so that we would hav e time to collect downhole log data with three different tool string s (triple combo, FMS-sonic, and VSI). In preparation for logging, w e circulated cuttings out of the hole (two 35 bbl mud sweeps) an d raised the bit to $1416\;\mathrm{m}$ where we removed the top drive. We the n continued to raise the bit to $1242\;\mathrm{m}$ and spent $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ $\mathsf{h}\left(1730{-}1830\,\mathrm{h}\right.$ o n 5 April) filling the borehole (and well up into the casing) with 30 0 bbl of weighted $\left(11.0\;\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{gal}\right)$ ) mud to increase our chances the hol e would stay open for collecting the log data. When this was finished, the drill string had become stuck and we were unable to raise it. W e spent the next $2.75~\mathrm{h}$ trying to free the drill string (installed the to p drive, pumped, and applied overpull). Finally, at $2115~\mathrm{h}$ on 5 April, we were able to resume raising the bit up the hole with the top drive.  

We deployed the subsea camera system as we finished pullin g the drill string out of Hole U1500B; the bit cleared the seafloor a t $0430\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 April. We offset the ship $20\;\mathrm{m}$ to the west, released th e bit on the seafloor at $0600\;\mathrm{h},$ reentered Hole U1500B at $0840\,\mathrm{h},$ an d set the end of the pipe at a logging depth of $35.4~\mathrm{m}$ (inside casing). After the camera system was recovered at $1100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 April, we prepared the rig floor for logging. We assembled a modified tripl e combo tool string that contained the following tools:  

• Dipole Sonic Imager Tool (DSI) for acoustic velocity,   
• High-Resolution Laterolog Array (HRLA)/Phasor Dual Induction-Spherically Focused Resistivity Tool (DIT) for electrical resistivity,   
• Hostile Environment Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS) without the source for caliper data, and   
• Hostile Environment Natural Gamma Ray Sonde (HNGS)/Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC-B) for NGR.  

At $1345~\mathrm{h}$ on 6 April, we started lowering to the seafloor. Th e tool passed through the base of the casing at $842\mathrm{~m~}$ and into th e open hole. It was unable to pass an obstruction at $1133\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{~}}$ , and lo g data were collected from there up to the base of the casing. Th e modified triple combo tool string arrived back on the rig floor a t $2145\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 April.  

We assembled an FMS tool string consisting of the FMS to collect borehole resistivity images and the HNGS and EDTC-B to collect NGR data and for correlating with the previous logging runs. This second tool string was only able to reach $1044\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{{}}}$ , 89 m shallower than the first logging string. We opened the FMS arms an d collected data from that depth up to the bottom of the casing at 84 2 m. Our last operation for Expedition 367 was to conduct a chec k shot experiment with the VSI (geophone). We started assemblin g the VSI tool string at 0700 on 7 April. It consisted of the VSI sond e and ETDC-B. Routine IODP protected-species procedures wer e implemented leading up to and throughout use of the seismi c source. The VSI tool string reached a total depth of $1031\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{~}}$ , an d data were collected at that depth as well as at one station in the bottom of the casing at $783~\mathrm{m}$ . The VSI tool string arrived back on th e rig floor at $1430\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 April. After the rig floor was cleared of logging equipment at $1530\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 April, we pulled the end of the pip e out of the hole ( $1523\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 April) and recovered the drill string. W e conducted operations at Site U1500 for a total of 30.3 days (5.5 day s in Hole U1500A; 24.8 days in Hole U1500B).  

At $0100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 April, we started our transit to Hong Kong. Expedition 367 ended with the first line ashore at $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 April.  

# Education and outreach  

Expedition 367 had a team of two Onboard Outreach Officers : one teacher from Italy and one journalist from China. The Officer s communicated the goals of their jobs on the ship to all scientists a t the very beginning of the expedition. This presentation gave examples of how the Onboard Outreach team could be a resource for th e scientists to share their research during the expedition to the general public. The two Onboard Outreach Officers had different approaches and targets in their responsibilities; this report include s both.  

The Officer/Teacher worked with three different outreach tools: webcasts, social media, and educational activities.  

# Webcasts  

The Onboard Outreach Officer interacted with locations o n shore to share the scientific goals and progress of the expedition b y using iPads and the videoconferencing software, Zoom. The vide o connection schedule was prepared using a public Google calendar, direct contact with teachers to advertise the opportunity, and requests from scientists onboard the JOIDES Resolution. Each webcast was led by a scientist who spoke the native language of th e shore-based school (primarily Italian and English). The connection s were used to reach students from primary schools to universitie s (both graduate and undergraduate levels) and professional development workshops. A typical session was approximately $^{1\,\mathrm{h}}$ and wa s divided into the following parts:  

• Identification of the geographical location and presentation of the geological questions addressed by the expedition,   
• Tour of the ship with a close look at the derrick, the rig floor, and the catwalk,   
• Tour of the labs with questions to the scientists present (usually sedimentologists, core describers, paleomagnetists, and paleontologists), and   
• Opportunities for the students to ask questions.  

A total of 99 events reached ${\sim}7100$ students in 7 different countries (Italy, China, USA, France, Germany, Spain, and Argentina)  

Before every video connection, the Onboard Outreach Office r interacted with the schools by sending the teachers some selecte d educational material about the JOIDES Resolution, the seafloo r drilling research, and the scientific topics related to Expedition 36 7 (e.g., tectonic plates). After the video connection, a postsurvey wa s sent to all the teachers and participants (from Europe and America).  

# Social media  

The Onboard Outreach Officer maintained four social medi a accounts during the expedition: the JOIDES Resolution’s Faceboo k page, Twitter feed, and Instagram account, and a blog at http://joidesresolution.org. The total number of posts on the blog was 40. The blog posts were divided into different areas: science on board, behind the science, life on a ship, and education and outreach. Eac h post required some time to collect information (through interviews, for example) and was reviewed for accuracy before publishing. Th e total number of Facebook posts was 40. The posts were viewe d ${\sim}95{,}000$ times and replied to, liked, or shared $\mathord{\sim}7000$ times. A tota l of ${\sim}40$ posts was published on Twitter and Instagram, too.  

The Onboard Outreach Officer also hosted a Reddit Scienc e “Ask Me Anything” session, answering 24 questions from the publi c over the course of $2\;\mathrm{{h}}$ . Three members of the science party (basically all the English native speakers on shift at the time of the session) assisted with this session, which is permanently archived a t https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/618g7f/science_ama_series_we_are_scientists_on_board_the/.  

Midway through the expedition, the Onboard Outreach Office r held a contest for schools to guess the depth of the basement at Sit e U1500. One third of the schools that connected to the ship via webcasts participated in the contest.  

# Media  

The Onboard Outreach Officer facilitated interviews betwee n reporters from national media outlets and the science party. Sh e provided background information, photographs, and video footage. This resulted in:  

• One interview with an Italian journalist for an online article: https://oggiscienza.it/2017/03/08/joides-perforazione-oceanica-geologia/;   
• One interview with an Italian journalist that resulted in an online video interview and an article in the scientific rubric of the newspaper: http://www.repubblica.it/scienze/2017/03/19/foto/ricercatori_internazionali_sulla_nave _education_and_outreach_officer-160942447/1/#1;   
• One radio interview: http://www.radio3.rai.it/dl/portaleRadio/media/ContentItem-94c91c08-f402-4a11-9406- 161452bb3513.html; and   
• One outreach event with a German television station: https://hannover.sat1regional.de/aktuell/article/unterirdisch-wissenschaftsshow-fuer-rund-750-schueler-in-braunschweig-228928.html.  

# Educational material  

The Onboard Outreach Officer recorded several interview s with scientists and technical staff. These recorded interviews resulted in videos discussing the research activities onboard. Thes e were also edited in different languages. Other videos, interview s and pictures collected during the expedition will be used for postexpedition activities to develop additional educational materials.  

# Chinese media outreach  

During the 2 months of Expedition 367, the Xinhua New s Agency had broadcasts with ${>}30$ news articles, including 180 photos. These reports described the history and achievements of IODP, the research progress of ocean drilling in the SCS, and the important progress of Expedition 367. These reports included overviews o f each scientist’s research. These reports with pictures and texts wer e widely reproduced in the Chinese media and the network, which attracted a lot of attention for IODP drilling and scientific research i n the SCS.

Figure F1. Seismic data coverage and magnetic anomalies of the South China Sea Basin, Expedition 367. Black lines $=$ ocean-bottom seismometer refractio n data. Other seismic lines are mostly multichannel seismic reflection data. White stars $=$ Expedition 367 and 368 drill sites. ODP Leg 184 (red squares) and IOD P Expedition 349 (red circles) sites are shown with site numbers. For more details, see Figure F4.

Figure F2. A–D. Schematic development of continental breakup initiated by a simple shear along a deep, low-angle fault. B–D are slightly modified from Huismans and Beaumont (2011) and illustrate modeling-based stages of extension at magma-poor rifted margins of the Iberia-Newfoundland type. Key features o f D are thinning of the upper crust, juxtaposition of lower crust (e.g., Site U1499), and serpentinized mantle (Site U1500) between the outer margin and igneou s oceanic crust. $\mathsf{U P=}$ upper plate, $\mathsf{L P=}$ lower plate.

Figure F3. Northern South China Sea margin with seismic coverage of 2-D, time-migrated multichannel seismic reflection seismic data and ocean-bottom seismometer data. Key seismic lines used for planning of the drilling transect are marked in thick blue lines. White stars $=$ Expedition 367 drill sites. Red lines $=$ magnetic lineations within the ocean crust. Magnetic chron number is after Briais et al. (1993).

Figure F4. Two-way traveltime to (A) basement (Tg unconformity) and (B) Reflector T60. The proposed drilling transect (thick black line) is located approximately at the center of a margin segment bounded to the southwest by a transform fault. The northeastern boundary of the margin segment is located aroun d Expedition 349 Site U1435. In this location, the outer margin high and Ridge A seem to coalesce, and Ridges B and C of the continent–ocean transition becom e indistinct toward the northeast within the next margin segment. Note that the outer margin high is slightly oblique to more parallel Ridges A, B, and C.

Figure F5. Deep crustal time-migrated seismic reflection data (A) without interpretation and (B) with interpretation. Note the rather thin lower crust (two layers) above a strong Mohorovicic seismic discontinuity (Moho) reflector that can be followed oceanward. Moho reflection is weak to absent seaward fro m around the interpreted continent–ocean boundary (COT). Wide-angle seismic data (Yan et al., 2001) confirm $\sim\!6\,\mathsf{k m}$ thick ocean crust (OC) to be present seaward of the COT. A large detachment fault $\sim\!150\;\mathsf{k m}$ inland of the COT separates more stable crust landward from that of highly extended crust seaward. A n outer margin high (OMH) is a fairly consistent feature margin along this margin segment. Key seismic unconformities are shown in purple (T70; $^{\sim32}$ M a breakup unconformity?) and blue (T60; $^{\sim23}$ Ma regional basin event). These ages are inferred from long-distance $(>\mid00\mid\mathsf{k m})$ correlation of seismic unconformities with industry holes and ODP Leg 184 Site 1148 (T60). These ages need confirmation by coring, and are only tentative. Tg unconformity (green) is basement. Approximate position of seafloor magnetic anomalies with chron numbers are shown by arrows. Seismic data is from Line 04ec1555-08ec1555 (courtes y of the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation [CNOOC]). Location of line is shown in Figure F3. ${\mathsf{C D P}}=$ common depth point; C11?, C10?, and $C9?=$ possibl e Chrons. $\mathsf{M S B=}$ midslope basin.
