# Introduction and operations  

This chapter documents the methods used for shipboard measurements and analyses during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 358. We conducted riser drilling from 2887.3 to 3262.5 meters below seafloor (mbsf) at Site C0002 (see Table T1 in the Expedition 358 summary chapter [Tobin et al., 2020a]) as a continuation of riser drilling in Hole C0002F begun during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 326 (Expedition 326 Scientists, 2011) and deepened during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 338 and 348 (Strasser et al., 2014b; Tobin et al., 2015b). Please note that the top of Hole C0002Q begins from the top of the window cut into the Hole C0002P casing. Previous Integrated Ocean Drilling Program work at Site C0002 included logging and coring during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 314 (logging while drilling [LWD]), 315 (riserless coring), 332 (LWD and long-term monitoring observatory installation), 338 (riser drilling and riserless coring), and 348 (riser drilling) (Expedition 314 Scientists, 2009; Expedition 315 Scientists, 2009b; Expedition 332 Scientists, 2011; Strasser et al., 2014b; Tobin et al., 2015b).  

Riserless contingency drilling was also conducted at Site C0024 (LWD and coring) near the deformation front of the Nankai accretionary prism off the Kii Peninsula and at Site C0025 (coring only) in the Kumano fore-arc basin.  

Riser operations began with connection of the riser to the Hole C0002F wellhead, sidetrack drilling out the cement shoes from 2798 to 2966 mbsf to establish a new hole, and then running a cement bond log to check the integrity of the Hole C0002P casing-formation bonding. A new sidetrack was established parallel to previous Hole C0002P drilling and designated as Hole C0002Q to distinguish it from the overlapping interval in Hole C0002P. Several new kick offs were established (Holes C0002R–C0002T) in attempts to overcome problems drilling to the target depth and then, in the end, to collect core samples.  

During riser operations, we collected drilling mud, mud gas, cuttings, downhole logs, core samples, and drilling parameters (including mud flow rate, weight on bit [WOB], torque on bit, and downhole pressure, among others). Gas from drilling mud was analyzed in near–real time in a special mud-gas monitoring laboratory (MGML) and was sampled for further postcruise research. Continuous LWD data were transmitted on board and displayed in real time for QC and for initial assessment of borehole environment and formation properties. Recorded-mode LWD data provided higher spatial sampling of downhole parameters and conditions. Cuttings were sampled for standard shipboard analyses and shore-based research. Small-diameter rotary core barrel (SD-RCB; $8\%$ inch) coring in Hole C0002T provided only minimal core. Riserless coring at Sites C0024 and C0025 with a $10\%$ inch rotary core barrel (RCB)  

and hydraulic piston coring system (HPCS)/extended punch corin g system (EPCS)/extended shoe coring system (ESCS) bottom-hol e assembly (BHA) provided most of the core used for standard shipboard and shore-based research.  

# Site C0002 drilling operations  

Operations at Site C0002 were strictly riser drilling. With th e riser attached to the wellhead, drilling mud was circulated to clea n the hole of cuttings, prevent wellbore failure, and maintain borehol e pressure to balance stresses and pore pressure in the formation. IODP riser-based drilling on the D/V Chikyu differs from riserles s drilling in ways that impact science, most notably in that cutting s can be collected continuously whenever the drill bit is advancin g and core physical properties and chemistry may be affected by th e invasion of components of drilling mud (e.g., Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010a).  

Continuous monitoring of mud weight, annular pressure, mu d losses, and other circulation data during riser drilling can provid e useful constraints on formation pore fluid pressure and state o f stress (e.g., Zoback, 2007). Problems related to mud weight or hol e collapse may impact successful drilling or casing of the borehole itself, as well as the ability to conduct downhole measurements or t o achieve postdrilling scientific objectives, including observatory installations and active source seismic experiments. Because rise r drilling remains relatively new to IODP, we followed recent proceedings from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 319, 338, and 348 to describe key observations related to downhol e (borehole) pressure, mud weight, and hole conditions while drillin g Holes C0002Q–C0002T.  

# Site C0024 and C0025 contingency drilling operations  

Riserless drilling at Sites C0024 and C0025 followed standar d IODP protocols and procedures. LWD and coring were performe d at Site C0024, and only coring was performed at Site C0025.  

# Reference depths  

Depths of each measurement or sample are reported reference d to the drilling vessel rig floor (rotary table) in meters below rotar y table (BRT) and the seafloor (mbsf) (Table T1). These depths ar e determined by drill pipe and wireline lengths and are correlated t o each other by the use of distinct reference points. Drilling engineer s refer to pipe length when reporting depth and report it as drillin g depth below rig floor (DRF) in meters. Core depths are based o n drilling depth below rig floor to the top of the cored interval an d curated length of the recovered core. During Expedition 358, cor e depths are converted to core depth below seafloor, Method B (CSFB), using a compression algorithm that is incapable of overlap relative to the cored interval and section boundaries in cases of ${>}100\%$ core recovery due to expansion after coring (Table T1) (see IOD P Depth Scales Terminology at http://www.iodp.org/policies-andguidelines). Cuttings and mud depths are reported as mud dept h below rig floor (MRF) or mud depth below seafloor (MSF) and ar e based on drilling depth (DRF) and the calculated lag depth of th e cuttings (see below for further details).  

In referring to LWD results, depth was measured as LWD dept h below rig floor (LRF) and sometimes reported as LWD depth belo w seafloor (LSF) (see Logging). Depths reported in depth below ri g floor (DRF and MRF) are converted to depth below seafloor (drilling depth below seafloor [DSF] or CSF and MSF, respectively) b y subtracting water depth and the height of the rig floor from the se a surface $(28.5\ \mathrm{m})$ and making corrections relative to drilling dept h where appropriate. These depths below seafloor (DSF, CSF, MSF, and LSF) are therefore all referenced to an equivalent datum. Seismic data are presented in either time (seconds) or depth (meters). For time sections, a two-way traveltime (TWT; seconds) scale i s used. For depth sections, seismic depth below seafloor (SSF) or seismic depth below sea level (SSL) are used.

Because Holes ${\mathrm{C}0002{\mathrm{Q}}}–{\mathrm{C}}0002{\mathrm{T}}$ are sidetracked holes (see Sit e C0002 drilling operations), there is a ${\sim}1\mathrm{-}2\mathrm{~m~}$ difference in tota l between the true vertical depth (TVD) and the measured dept h (MD) along the hole that is used for all shipboard measurements. Therefore, a measured depth (MD- $\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{m}$ BRT and MD-mbsf) and  a true vertical depth (TVD- $\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{m}$ BRT and TVD-mbsf) are defined fo r any position along the boreholes. Because the difference is small, w e used measured depth rather than true vertical depth for all measurements reported in this volume unless otherwise explicitly note d (i.e., in this volume “mbsf” refers to MD-mbsf).  

# Cuttings and mud depths  

• $\operatorname{SMW}=\mathbf{s}$ solid taken from drilling mud (cuttings).   
• $L M\mathbb{W}=$ liquid taken from drilling mud.   
• $\operatorname{GMW}=\mathbf{g}$ as taken from drilling mud.  

During riser drilling, drilling mud circulates down the drillin g pipe, out at the drill bit, up the borehole annulus into the riser pipe, and back up to the drillship. As the drill bit cuts through the formation, cuttings are suspended in the drilling mud and carried with th e drilling mud, formation fluid, and formation gas back to the ship.  A cuttings sample is assumed to be a mixture of rock fragments, sediments, and drilling fluid from the sampled interval. The time between when the formation is cut by the drill bit and when thes e cuttings arrive at the ship is known as the “lag time,” which is a function of drilling mud pumping rate and annular mud volume and i s used to calculate the “lag depth.” Lag time and lag depth values fo r cuttings samples were provided by Geoservices engineers. At a constant pump rate, lag time and lag depth increase as the hole is deepened and the volume of circulating mud increases. All of the depth s reported for cuttings and mud gas in Holes C0002Q–C0002T hav e been corrected for this calculated lag (see MUDGAS in Supplementary material). Because cuttings disperse and mix as they ar e carried to the surface, any given cuttings sample is believed to b e representative of a depth-averaged volume; the precision of thei r depth of origin is assumed to be $\sim\!5\,\mathrm{m}$ under normal conditions, an d it is always possible that cavings and material from higher position s in the hole can be present at misleading lag depth.  

Additional information for individual samples (e.g., cuttings siz e fraction) is provided in the comments section of the J-CORES database system and reported as, for example, “358-C0002Q-123-SMW, $1{-}4\;\mathrm{mm}^{\prime\prime}$ $1{-}4\;\mathrm{mm}$ size fraction aliquot of cuttings from the 123r d cuttings sample recovered from Hole C0002Q during Expeditio n 358).  

# Influence of drilling mud composition on cuttings  

Bit depth samples (SDBs) are defined as samples collected fro m any of the blades or cutting surfaces of any of the drilling or millin g BHAs deployed. Depth assignment to each bit sample is define d with the window top as the top depth and the deepest advance o f that BHA as the bottom depth.  

Because of the recirculation of drilling mud and continuous production of formation cuttings and fluids, cuttings samples are contaminated. Expedition 319 Scientists (2010b) discussed the possibl e effects of contamination on different types of measurements. Ne w observations of contamination and artifacts induced by riser drilling operations and further QA/QC analysis were performed durin g Expedition 358 and are reported in the individual methods and sit e chapters.  

# Sampling and classification of material transported by drilling mud  

A total of 155 cuttings samples were collected between 2887. 3 and 3262.5 mbsf while drilling Holes C0002Q–C0002T. Cutting s were collected every $5\textrm{m}$ from the shale shakers. Drilling mud an d mud gases were also regularly sampled during drilling (see Geochemistry). Mud-gas, fluid, and cuttings samples were classified b y drill site and hole using a sequential material number followed by a n abbreviation describing the type of material:  

# Cuttings handling  

In Holes C0002Q–C0002T, we routinely collected $5000~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ o f cuttings from the shale shaker every $5\,\textrm{m}$ for shipboard analysis, long-term archiving, and personal samples for shore-based postcruise research. In addition, we collected $20,\!000\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of cuttings every $100\,\mathrm{m}$ for personal samples for shore-based postcruise research. Analyses and descriptions of cuttings were made, however, every 1 0 m. Samples of all processed cuttings samples were sent to the Koch i Core Center (KCC; Japan) for permanent archiving.  

The standard cuttings laboratory flow is summarized in Figur e F1. Unwashed cuttings samples were taken in the core-processin g laboratory for the following objectives:  

• $400\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ for measuring natural gamma radiation (NGR) (see Physical properties) and archiving at the KCC,   
• $200\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ for lithology description,   
• $5\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ for hydrocarbon analyses,   
• $10\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ for hydrogen and carbon monoxide analyses, and   
• $50\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ for micropaleontology (calcareous nannofossils and radiolarians).  

After lithology description and removing iron contaminant s originating from drilling tools and casing, aliquots $(23\ {\mathsf{c m}}^{3})$ ) of ${>}4$ mm intact washed cuttings handpicked by the lithology group wer e vacuum dried and ground for X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and organic geochemistry analyses (total organi c carbon [TOC], total carbon [TC], and total nitrogen [TN]).  

The remaining unwashed cuttings were washed gently with seawater in a $250\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ sieve from which a $400~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample was taken fo r another NGR measurement for comparison and archiving at th e KCC. The remaining gently washed cuttings were further washe d and sieved with seawater using 0.25, 1, and $4~\mathrm{mm}$ mesh and separated into size fractions of $_{<1}$ , 1–4, and $>\!4\ \mathrm{mm}$ . During sieving,  a hand magnet was used to remove iron contaminants. These iro n grains and a ${<}1\ \mathrm{mm}$ fraction were kept for archiving at the KCC. The 1–4 and $>\!4\;\mathrm{mm}$ fractions were then used or taken for the following objectives:  

• Both fractions for photographing, • $>\!4\;\mathrm{mm}$ fraction for X-ray computed tomography (CT),

• $200\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ from each fraction for structural description and selected cuttings for microscopy-based observations of thin sections,   
• $30\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ from each fraction and $30\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ from intact cuttings after the structure description for bulk moisture and density (MAD) measurements,   
• $7\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ from each fraction for magnetic susceptibility measurements, and   
• Creating a cuttings composite section (CCS) for each hole.  

The CCS is designed to create a stratigraphic model using a spli t core liner. Two CCSs were created from each cuttings fraction fo r each hole. Each CCS includes $3\,\mathrm{cm}$ wide pockets, and each pocket i s filled with $50\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of washed cuttings collected every $10\,\mathrm{m}$ of drillin g advance. Thus, a $150\;\mathrm{cm}$ long CCS corresponds to a $500\;\mathrm{m}$ drillin g interval.  

Intact cuttings are considered to represent the formation an d were collected by handpicking by each group from washed cuttings. Types of cuttings used for shipboard description and standard measurements are summarized in Table T2.

# Drilling mud handling  

Drilling mud samples were collected at two locations: mud tank s and the mud return ditch. Sampling was carried out regularly ever y 2–3 days. Drilling mud samples were used for measuring background and contamination effects for NGR and TOC analysis (se e Physical properties and Geochemistry). Additional mud sample s were collected once every $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ ( $100\;\mathrm{mL}$ each) for archiving as reference material.  

# Mud-gas handling  

Mud gas was extracted from drilling mud immediately after th e mud returned from the borehole. A constant-volume degasser wit h a self-cleaning agitator was installed in the mud trough just befor e the shale shakers, and the gas extracted in the degasser chambe r was pumped to the MGML using a PVC tube. Tests comparing th e gas extraction volumes and gas species detected showed that ther e was no difference in position either in the “Gumbo” location in th e bypass valve or when placed in the return mud trench before th e shakers. Therefore, the degasser unit was moved to the mud retur n ditch just “upstream” of the shale shakers based primarily on th e ease of clearing the mud return trench when compared to th e Gumbo location. Analysis in the unit is described in Geochemistry.  

# Core handling  

An $8\%$ inch SD-RCB coring tool with $7.3~\,\mathrm{cm}$ inside diamete r plastic core liner was used in Hole C0002T. Only minimal core wa s collected. A $10\%$ inch RCB system and HPCS/EPCS/ESCS was use d at Sites C0024 and C0025. Cores from Sites C0024 and C0025 wer e typically cut into ${\sim}1.4\,\mathrm{m}$ sections at the core cutting area and logge d and labeled by the shipboard curator. Site C0025 cores were preserved for a port call “core description party” to sample and perfor m shipboard measurements on board Chikyu from 13 to 18 July 2019.  

Figure F2 shows the basic core processing flow chart. A smal l volume $(\sim\!5\!-\!10\ensuremath{~\,\mathrm{cm^{3}}})$ of sample was taken for micropaleontolog y from the core catcher section. Potential core sections for time-sensitive whole-round (WR) samples for anelastic strain recovery (ASR ) were first run through the $\mathrm{X}$ -ray CT scanner. Core watchdogs the n ensured that the samples could be used and did not contain any evident key features that should be preserved. Once approved, thes e WR samples were identified as core sections. ASR samples were approximately $10~\mathrm{cm}$ long. All other core sections were taken to th e core processing deck for standard X-ray CT scanning and core logging with the whole-round multisensor core logger (MSCL-W).  

After X-ray CT scanning and MSCL-W logging, community an d approved personal WR samples as long as ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{cm}$ were taken wher e intact, relatively homogeneous sections could be identified. Th e number of community WRs was limited by core recovery and cor e quality. All WRs were stored at $4^{\circ}C$ . Adjacent to WR samples (including the time-sensitive, community, and personal WRs), a cluster sample was taken at least once per section. The cluster sampl e was used for routine MAD, XRD, XRF, carbonate, and nitroge n analyses shipboard. Some cluster samples were used for shorebased research on clay-fraction XRD analysis.  

The core sections remaining after WR core sampling were spli t into working and archive halves. Digital images of archive-half sections were taken with the photo image logger (MSCL-I) before visua l core description by sedimentologists. Thermal conductivity measurements were performed on samples from the working halves usin g the half-space mode and on samples from WRs using the full-spac e mode. Discrete cubes for $P$ -wave velocity measurement were sampled from the working half. Additional samples were taken for MAD, XRD, XRF, and carbon analyses. After the expedition, all cores wer e transported under cool temperature for archiving at the KCC.

Visual core description  

# Lithology  

We made macroscopic observations using the archive halves o f split cores from Sites C0002 (Hole C0002T) and C0024 and followed standard IODP protocols for visual core description. Thes e data were supplemented by X-ray CT images, smear slide and thi n section microscopy, bulk powder XRD, and bulk powder elementa l XRF. Depths for core descriptions and samples are on the CSF- B depth scale (Table T1).  

We described cuttings from Holes C0002Q–C0002T followin g methods that were modified from the methodology of previou s riser drilling expeditions (Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010b; Strasse r et al., $2014{\bf a}_{\mathrm{i}}$ ; Tobin et al., 2015a). We made the modifications because most of the cuttings from Expedition 358 are lithified, whic h enhanced our ability to segregate lithologies. Specific tasks durin g cuttings analysis included visual (macroscopic) description, observation of X-ray CT images, smear slide and thin section microscopy, bulk powder XRD, and bulk powder elemental XRF. Depths for cuttings are on the MSF depth scale (Table T1), and data are plotted a t the base of a given cuttings interval.  

We first recorded sedimentologic information for cores on visual core description (VCD) forms on a section-by-section $(150\,\mathrm{cm})$ scale (Mazzullo and Graham, 1988). Scanned copies of the VCD s are archived in VCDSCAN in Supplementary material. Data o n the VCDs were transferred to section-scale templates using JCORES software and then converted to core-scale graphical depictions using Strater (Golden Software). Only discrete bed thicknesses ${>}10\ \mathrm{cm}$ were entered into the J-CORES database. Repetitiv e thin interbeds (e.g., silty clay and silt or sand) are depicted with bot h graphic patterns side by side. The dominant of the two lithologies i s shown on the left. We cataloged the base interval and thickness o f all discrete event beds (e.g., inferred turbidites and volcanic ash layers) on a separate spreadsheet (see EVENTBED in Supplementar y material).  

Texture (defined by the relative proportions of sand-, silt-, an d clay-sized grains) follows the classification of Shepard (1954). It i s difficult to discriminate accurately when a specimen’s grain size distribution is close to the 50:50 dividing line between two textural categories (e.g., between silty claystone and clayey siltstone) withou t quantitative grain size analysis. Therefore, that entire range of textures (i.e., silty claystone to clayey siltstone) is usually described i n the site reports as “silty clay(stone)” for simplicity. The classificatio n scheme for siliciclastic lithologies follows Mazzullo et al. (1988). Volcaniclastic and pyroclastic lithologies were divided only on th e basis of their texture (ash, lapilli, etc.) rather than by proportions o f clast type (e.g., glass shards, volcanic rock fragments, and primar y crystals). Contacts between interbedded lithologies were describe d as sharp, erosional, or gradational. Categories of core disturbanc e for unconsolidated sediment include slightly disturbed, moderatel y disturbed, heavily disturbed, soupy, and gas expansion. Categorie s of drilling-induced core disturbance for lithified sedimentary roc k include biscuit, slightly fractured, moderately fractured, highly fractured, and drilling brecciated.  

Except for Hole C0002T, we used the same graphic patterns fo r unconsolidated and indurated examples of the same lithologie s (Figure F3). For Hole C0002T, the lithology patterns for core are th e same as the patterns for cuttings. As an operational guide, lithologies recovered by the HPCS are “unconsolidated” sediment (e.g., silty clay or volcanic ash), whereas the same lithologies recovered b y the RCB system are “lithified” sedimentary rocks (e.g., silty claystone or tuff). The graphic lithology column on each VCD plots t o scale only beds that are thicker than $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ . Thinner interbeds (e.g., silty clay and silt) are depicted using composite graphic patterns. VCDs also include symbols for common internal sedimentar y structures (e.g., normal grading, planar lamination, cross-lamination, etc.), soft-sediment deformation, severity of core disturbance, and intensity of bioturbation (slight, moderate, or heavy).  

# Macroscopic observations of cuttings  

Cuttings typically occur as small fragments of sedimentary roc k ranging from 0.25 to $8\,\mathrm{mm}$ in size. Cuttings were routinely collecte d from the shale shaker at $5\,\mathrm{m}$ intervals, and samples were selected fo r detailed description every $10~\mathrm{m}$ . Sample processing started with  a $100{-}200~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ aliquot of bulk cuttings that was separated by we t sieving into four size fractions ${>}4\ \mathrm{mm}_{:}$ , $1{-}4~\mathrm{mm}$ , $63{-}125~\upmu\mathrm{m},$ an d ${<}63\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ ). Solid fragments from the formation are usually coated i n drilling mud and mixed with clay-bearing drilling additives (e.g., bentonite). Most of the drilling mud can be removed by washin g gently with seawater for $30{-}60\;\mathbf{s},$ , but separation is not always complete, especially with soft cuttings. This artifact hampers quantification of the true clay mineral content and may cause chemica l contamination (see $\mathbf{X}$ -ray fluorescence).  

Descriptive information recorded for each cuttings VCD includes lithology, color, induration (soft, semilithified, hard, o r loose), shape (angular, subangular, round, or platy), texture (crumbly, sticky, or fissile), sedimentary structures (lamination or siz e grading), organic matter (wood fragments or lignite), and fossil s (Figure F4). We segregated the different lithologies according to th e siliciclastic classification scheme of Mazzullo et al. (1988) an d counted their proportions in a population of 200 fragments. Th e four common categories of lithology are fine silty claystone, silt y claystone, siltstone, and very fine sandstone. All of the macroscopi c observations were recorded on VCD forms and summarized i n VCDSCAN in Supplementary material. Photographs of all cuttings samples, partitioned into the four common lithology categories  (Figure  F5),  are  also  available  in  CUTTINGS  i n Supplementary material. To evaluate reproducibility of the modified methods (compared to Expeditions 338 and 348), we reprocessed some samples from the lower part of Hole C0002P (2600– 2985 mbsf). Those tests showed no systematic artifacts or biases.  

# Identification of cement (concrete) cuttings  

Unfortunately, ambiguity exists in visual discrimination between artificial cement (concrete) cuttings and some types of fragments from the formation (Figure F6). Cement cuttings are mos t likely mistaken for coarse siltstone or sandstone. Compared to natural sedimentary rocks, however, framework grains in cement cuttings consistently fall within a narrower range of sizes (coarse silt t o sand) and grain sorting is significantly better. Confirmation by XR D shows typical cement phases (e.g., alite, belite, and portlandite), an d XRF verifies high concentrations of $C\mathsf{a O}$ . However, these tools ar e not practical to use on a routine basis, so some judgment is still required during visual analysis of cuttings.  

After closer examination, we recognized two confirmed types o f cement (concrete) cuttings during Expedition 358. Type 1 cutting s are gray in color and subangular in shape (Figure F6). Some of th e Type 1 cuttings envelop lithified fragments of silty claystone. Crystalline matrix content is usually $>\!70\%$ , and its color varies from ligh t gray to yellow. The fabric is matrix-supported. Crystals in the binding agent are not visible at $100\times$ magnification under a binocula r microscope. Approximately $10\%$ of the constituents in Type 1 concrete fragments are dark-colored, subangular silt- and sand-size d minerals, and roughly $10\%$ consist of transparent to light gray or yellow silt grains. Scattered reddish grains coexist with the subangula r black minerals. The overall texture has a salt-and-pepper appearance. Yellow material (probable drilling mud) also occurs as an infilling to small depressions.  

Type 2 cement (concrete) cuttings are yellow to light orang e with shapes ranging from subangular to well rounded (Figure F6) . Crystalline matrix content ranges from $50\%$ to $80\%$ of the mass, an d its color is lighter with a yellow to orange tint. The fabric is matrixsupported. Silt-sized minerals are dominant and compose $\mathord{\sim}15\%$ o f the cuttings. Well-rounded to subangular black minerals and angular yellow to brown minerals are the main silt-sized components. Sand grains are milky white (probable quartz) and well rounded. Scattered reddish silt grains are the only sign of oxidation.  

# Smear slide and thin section petrography  

Smear slides are very useful for routine identification of sediment texture and composition. The method is effective for petrographic examination of soft and semi-indurated sediments whe n disaggregation can be achieved using a toothpick or spatula (Marsaglia et al., 2013). Thin sections are more suitable than smear slide s for examining lithified sedimentary rocks.  

The sample location for each smear slide was entered into the JCORES database with a sample code of SS. We examined the smea r slides in transmitted and cross-polarized light using an Axiosko p 40A polarizing microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a Nikon DSFi1 digital camera. Abundances of biogenic, volcaniclastic, and siliciclastic constituents were estimated using a visual compariso n chart (Rothwell, 1989). For cores, estimates of sand-, silt-, and claysized percentages were entered into the J-CORES samples databas e along with abundance ranges for the identifiable grain types. Result s from visual estimates are grouped into the following range categories:

For thin repetitive interbeds of two lithologies (e.g., silty clay an d sand), dominant lithology is on the left. Note that patterns for Hole C0002T core lithologies are the same as patterns for Site C0002 cuttings (Figure F4). WH $=$ wellhead.

• $\mathrm{F}=$ few $(0.1\%{-}1\%)$ .

The proportions of major components (clay minerals, quartz, and feldspar) were also validated by XRD (see $\mathbf{X}$ -ray diffraction), and the absolute weight percent of carbonate was verified by coulometric  analysis  (see Geochemistry).  Photomicrographs  an d scanned smear slide forms are presented in SMEARSLD in Supplementary material.  

Individual cuttings pieces were chosen for smear slide production based on the dominant lithology identified in a given interval, with a spacing of $20\;\mathrm{m}$ , and the slides were produced by scraping of f

the surface of a representative fragment with a spatula. Sometime s an additional smear slide was made for a distinctive minor lithology. The errors in visual estimates for cuttings are larger than for softe r sediments because harder rock fragments do not disaggregate completely.  

To improve petrographic accuracy for lithified sedimentar y rocks, thin sections were produced from cuttings of the dominan t lithology every $20{-}40\;\mathrm{m}$ . Minor lithologies were picked every $50\,\mathrm{m}$ . The cuttings were first freeze-dried and impregnated under a vacuum (Epovac) with epoxy (Epofix) prior to mounting. Multiple cuttings fragments were attached to a glass slide with Petropoxy 154, and the thin section was prepared as a $0.03\ \mathrm{mm}$ thick slice. Befor e microscopic observation, some thin sections were covered by  a cover glass using index oil. Thin sections were observed and analyzed for mode composition analysis using an Axio Imager Al m POL-2 polarized microscope (Carl Zeiss).  

Figure F7 shows a comparison between visual estimates for different lithologies in cuttings using smear slides and thin sections. The differences are small. For more quantitative point counts, w e used a microscope equipped with a Micro Topper automatic sampl e stage and Medical Imaging Toolkit (MITO) software. Point count s of grain size and mineralogy (or rock-fragment type) were completed on 200 points per sample using an automated step size of 30 0 $\upmu\mathrm{m}$ . Based on that population size, the estimated error for normalized relative percentages of particle size (clay, silt, and sand) an d composition (10 constituent categories) is $6.8\%$ . Minor occurrence s were noted as “rare” on the description sheet. Thin section photomicrographs and scanned description sheets are included in THINSECT in Supplementary material.  

# X-ray diffraction  

The principal goal of XRD analysis during Expedition 358 was t o estimate the relative weight percentages of total clay minerals, quartz, feldspar, and calcite in both cuttings and core samples. Mos t of the specimens from cores were positioned in “clusters” next t o WR sample intervals (e.g., for interstitial water [IW] and personal WRs). For cuttings, XRD specimens were selected from $3\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ samples of the bulk cuttings using two size fractions. Bulk mix cutting s $(1{-}4\ \mathrm{mm})$ were picked every $50\,\textrm{m}$ . The dominant lithology wa s handpicked from intact cuttings of the $>\!4\,\mathrm{mm}$ size fraction every 2 0 m. For comparison, measurements were also made on handpicke d samples from minor lithologies (siltstone and fine sandstone) ever y $100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . All samples were washed in an ultrasonic bath to remov e drilling mud, freeze-dried, crushed for $5~\mathrm{min}$ with a ball mill, an d mounted as randomly oriented powders.  

The randomly oriented bulk powders were analyzed using  a PANalytical CubiX3 (PW3800) diffractometer. The scanning parameters were set as follows:  

• Generator $=45\;\mathrm{kV}$ .   
• Current $=40\;\mathrm{mA}$ .   
• Tube anode $\mathbf{\rho}=\mathbf{Cu}$ .   
• Wavelength $=1.54060\mathrm{~\AA~}(\$ $\mathbf{\nabla}(\mathbf{K}_{\upalpha1})$ and 1.54443 Å $\left(\mathbb{K}_{\alpha2}\right)$ .   
• Step spacing $=0.005^{\circ}26\$ .   
• Scan step time $=0.635\;\mathrm{s}$ .   
• Divergent slit $=0.25^{\circ}$ .   
• Irradiated length $=10\;\mathrm{mm}$ .   
• Scanning range $=2^{\circ}{-}60^{\circ}2\theta$ .   
• Spinning $=$ yes.

To maintain as much consistency as possible with previous Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) results, we used MacDiff 4.2.5 software to process the digital XRD dat a (http://www.ccp14.ac.uk/ccp/ccp14/ftp-mirror/krumm/Software/macintosh/macdiff/MacDiff.html).  Data  reduction  included creating a smooth baseline, smoothing counts, and shiftin g peak positions using the stable quartz (101) reflection for reference. Before determining peak area values, we also adjusted the uppe r and lower limit for each diagnostic peak following the guideline s shown in Table T3.  

Calculations of relative mineral abundance utilized a matrix o f normalization factors derived by singular value decompositio n (SVD). The guiding principle is that X-ray counts for any particula r mineral will depend not only on the abundance of that mineral bu t also on the abundances of other minerals in the mix (Fisher and Underwood, 1995). Calibration of SVD factors requires analysis o f mineral standards using mixtures with known weight percentages; to be reliable, the mixtures must be close matches to the natural sediments of interest. We analyzed 13 bulk powder mixtures representative of deposits in the Nankai Trough study area (Table T4), a s

tors (Table T5) was computed using average peak area values (total counts) for the four diagnostic peaks after the standards were reru n three times (Table T4).  

Average errors (SVD-derived weight percent versus true weigh t percent) for the standard mineral mixtures are small (Table T4):  

• Total clay minerals $=1.6\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ .   
• Quartz $=1.2\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ .   
• Feldspar $=0.7\;\mathrm{Wt\%}$ .   
• Calcite $=1.0\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ .  

Despite its precision with the standard mixtures, the SVD metho d remains semiquantitative for a variety of reasons. Assessments o f precision (reproducibility) with previous results from NanTroSEIZ E expeditions, for example, need to consider the influences of replacing the X-ray diffractometer on Chikyu prior to Expedition 358, Xray tube fatigue (which results in systematically lower peak intensities), use of different sets of SVD normalization factors, and operator bias.

Several additional details contribute to inaccuracy. As with an y bulk powder XRD method, peak response differs between poorl y crystalline minerals at low diffraction angles (e.g., clay minerals ) and highly crystalline minerals at higher diffraction angles (e.g., quartz and plagioclase). To determine abundance for the total cla y mineral assemblage, one option is to measure one peak for eac h mineral and add the estimates together (thereby propagating the error). That error is enlarged further by overlap between the smectit e (001) and chlorite (001) peaks. Instead, our preferred method is t o measure a single composite peak that spans from approximatel y $18.6^{\circ}$ to $20.4^{\circ}2\theta$ (Figure F8). That range of angles captures th e counts from all of the common clay minerals, including the chlorit e (003) peak. Additional sources of error include unaccounted for impurities in the mineral standards and inconsistencies in crystallinit y between standards and natural minerals as burial depths and diagenesis increase. For cuttings, drilling mud contamination is als o possible. Another glitch arises in computations when quantities o f calcite are zero or barely above the XRD detection limit $({\sim}1.5\,\mathrm{wt\%})$ . The use of negative SVD normalization factors (Table T5) the n translates into negative values of absolute weight percent for calcite. In such cases, we adopted a value of $0.1\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ as a proxy for “trace.”  

For the specimens analyzed during Expedition 358, calculate d mineral abundances should be regarded as nothing more than relative percentages within a four-component system of total clay minerals (smectite, illite, chlorite, and kaolinite) $^+$ quartz $^+$ feldspa r (plagioclase and K-feldspar) $^+$ calcite. We tabulated the “absolute ” SVD-derived abundances on spreadsheets, but weight percent values have been normalized to $100\%$ for graphical plots. Larger discrepancies  between  the absolute and normalized abundance s indicate larger mismatches between the standard mineral mixture s and natural specimens. Such differences, however, provide a useful measure of the total amount of all other minerals (e.g., pyroxene, halite, and pyrite) and amorphous solids (e.g., biogenic silica an d volcanic glass) within the total solids. For most natural samples, those differences add up to between $5\%$ and $10\%$ .

# X-ray fluorescence  

XRF spectrometry was performed to quantify major elemen t abundances in cuttings and core samples. As for XRD analysis, mos t of the specimens from cores were positioned in clusters next to W R sample intervals (e.g., for IW and personal WRs). For cuttings, thes e analyses were conducted on $10\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ samples of the dominant lithology handpicked from intact cuttings of the $>4\,\mathrm{mm}$ size fraction every $20\;\mathrm{m}$ . Bulk mix cuttings were analyzed every $50\,\mathrm{m}$ . Additionally, measurements were also made on samples from minor lithologie s (siltstones, sandstone, and tuff) every ${100}\,\mathrm{m}$ or upon prominent occurrence. All samples were first washed in an ultrasonic bath to remove drilling mud, vacuum-dried, and crushed with a ball mill.  

Major elements in bulk sediment samples were measured o n fused glass beads and reported as weight percent oxide proportion s $\mathrm{(Na_{2}O,}$ MgO, $\mathrm{{Al}}_{2}\mathrm{{O}}_{3}$ , $\mathrm{SiO}_{2:}$ , $\mathrm{P_{2}O_{5}},$ $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O},$ , $C\mathsf{a O}$ , $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ , MnO, and $\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3},$ ). An aliquot of $0.9\,\mathrm{g}$ of ignited sample powder was fused with $4.5\:\mathrm{g}$ o f SmeltA12 flux for $7\ \mathrm{min}$ at $1150^{\circ}C$ to create glass beads. Loss o n ignition was measured using weight changes on heating at $105^{\circ}C$ fo r $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ and then at $1000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $^{3\,\mathrm{h}}$ . Analyses were performed on a wavelength-dispersive XRF spectrometer Supermini (Rigaku) equippe d with a 200 W Pd anode X-ray tube at $50\;\mathrm{kV}$ and $4~\mathrm{mA}$ . Analytica l details and measuring conditions for each component are given i n  

Table T6. Starting with specimens from Hole C0002R, the analyse s were performed without spinning the sample mounting table; QA/QC analyses on standards reveal no effects on the reported results. Rock standards of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Geological Survey of Japan) wer e used as the reference materials for quantitative analysis. Table T7 lists the results for selected standard samples. A calibration curv e was created with matrix corrections provided by the operating software using the average content of each component.  

# Designation of lithologic units  

Following conventional IODP strategies, divisions among lithologic units, subunits, and their boundaries are based mostly o n macroscopic and microscopic attributes at the facies scale (e.g., ratio of dominant to minor lithologies, composition of minor lithologies,  ranges  of  bed  thickness,  and  inferred  processes  o f deposition). We also considered XRD and XRF data together wit h LWD and physical property data (see Logging and Physical properties). Contrasts in grain density and porosity are relevant becaus e they tend to change consistently with grain size and mineralogy. Fo r cuttings, however, caveats need to be applied when discriminatin g between true formation variations and mechanical artifacts cause d by preferential preservation of more resistant versus less resistan t lithologies, differences in cutting tools among BHAs, drilling parameters, types of drill bits, changes in drilling mud composition, and pumping of cement into the borehole.

# Structural geology  

During Expedition 358, two types of sample material were use d for structural geology analyses: cuttings $_{>4}$ and $1{-}4~\mathrm{mm}$ size fractions) and cores. Cuttings were sampled during riser drilling at $10\,\mathrm{m}$ intervals between 2887.3 and 3262.5 mbsf in Hole C0002Q, betwee n 2789.5 and 3084.5 mbsf in Hole C0002R, between 2842.5 an d 2933.5 mbsf in Hole C0002S, and between 2817.5 and 2848.5 mbs f in Hole C0002T. Cores were recovered from 2836.5 to 2843.8 mbs f in Hole C0002T, between 0 and 319.5 mbsf and between 510 an d 621.5 mbsf at Site C0024, and between 400 and 580.5 mbsf at Sit e C0025 (see Table T1 for depth scales). The methods used to document the structural geology data of Expedition 358 cores and cuttings are largely based on those used by the Integrated Ocea n Drilling Program Expedition 315, 319, 338, 343, and 348 structura l geologists (Expedition 315 Scientists, $2009\mathrm{a}$ ; Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010b; Expedition 343/343T Scientists, 2013; Strasser et al., 2014a; Tobin et al., 2015a).  

# Description and data collection  

# Cuttings  

Structural descriptions were made on sieved and washed (se e cuttings workflow in Figure F1) cuttings collected at $20\;\mathrm{m}$ interval s at 2887.3–3262.5 mbsf in Hole $C0002\mathrm{Q},$ 2789.5–3082.5 mbsf i n Hole C0002R, 2842.5–2933.5 mbsf in Hole C0002S, and $2817.5-$ 2848.5 mbsf in Hole C0002T, as well as on cuttings collected at $^{<20}$ m intervals for regions of interest (e.g., fault zones and the first occurrence of a specific structure). Cuttings from each bag wer e sieved using a stack of $4~\mathrm{mm}$ and $1~\mathrm{mm}$ mesh sieves and washe d thoroughly with seawater for several minutes on the core processin g deck to reduce the amount of drilling-induced cohesive aggregat e (DICA) and pillowed cuttings. The cuttings samples were then sonicated in seawater for $3\;\mathrm{min}$ to remove drilling mud adhered to cuttings clasts. Subsequent washing and sieving continued until th e large majority of the drilling mud, pillowed cuttings, and DICA s were removed. Sieving with 4 and $1\;\mathrm{mm}$ meshes allowed extractio n of both ${>}4$ and $1{-}4\;\mathrm{mm}$ sized intact cuttings for structural analysis. In some samples collected during Expedition 348, ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ of the total initial cuttings disaggregated entirely. This potentially induced  a bias toward more indurated rock types (silty sandstone and siltstone) in less consolidated deposits. However, at the depths drille d during Expedition 358, this bias is less of a concern.  

A subset of ${\sim}100{-}600$ grains from each cuttings bag was selected for visual description under a binocular or digital microscope. For each ${>}4$ and $1{-}4\;\mathrm{mm}$ sample, we noted the occurrence o f bedding, carbonate, pyrite and/or quartz veins, slickenlined surfaces (or slickensides), cataclastic bands, deformation bands (Maltman et al., 1993), web structures (Byrne, 1984), and scaly fabri c (Moore et al., 1986). We also noted the occurrence of open fractures, fresh drilling-induced striae, or other drilling-induced structures and the occurrence of thin or flat splintery cuttings that ma y actually be caving indicative of borehole breakouts. Exceptional examples of other features recovered in the cuttings were picked an d saved (well-preserved fossils, etc.). A tally of the number of deformation features by type and host lithology was compiled in an Excel spreadsheet, and percent abundance of each feature was calculate d for each depth interval (Figure F9). Thin sections were made an d observed under the optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) to describe representative or particularly interesting structural elements.

Following visual description, X-ray CT scanning (see $\mathbf{X}$ -ra y computed tomography) was performed on both the described subset of $>\!4\;\mathrm{mm}$ cuttings and bulk undescribed $1{-}4\;\mathrm{mm}$ cuttings. Cuttings from the $>\!4\,\textrm{m m}$ subset were divided into separate bag s labeled (a) veins, (b) striae/scaly fabric, (c) no deformation, o r (d) other, and cuttings from the $1{-}4\,\mathrm{~mm}$ samples were labele d (e) not described. In addition, as many as three individual cutting s with interesting deformation features were bagged separately an d labeled 1–3. These bags were placed in the X-ray CT scanner in order 1–3 and a–e. X-ray CT scans were used to examine the 3-D geometry of observed deformation features, especially veins and faul t fabrics, to identify other deformational features internal to cutting s that may not have been observed during visual description, and t o preserve a digital archive of cuttings samples.  

# Cores  

Structures preserved in the cores were documented on spli t cores (working half) and on X-ray CT images of unsplit cores (se e X-ray computed tomography). Observations on split cores wer e entered on the structural geology observation sheet by hand (Figur e F10) and then transferred to a calculation sheet and the J-CORE S database (see Data processing). Core observations and measurements followed procedures of previous Ocean Drilling Progra m (ODP) and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program expeditions in th e  

Nankai and Costa Rica subduction zones (e.g., ODP Legs 131, 170, and 190 and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 315, 316, 319, 322, 333, 334, 338, 343, and 348). We measured the orientations of all structures observed in cores using a modified plasti c protractor (Figure F11) and noted the measurements on the structural geology observation sheet with descriptions and sketches o f structures. The orientations of planar or linear features in core s were defined with respect to the core reference frame, for which th e core axis is defined as “vertical” and the double line marked on th e working half of the core liner is arbitrarily called “north,” $0^{\circ}$ or $360^{\circ}$ (Figure F12; in unoriented core, this does not correspond to tru e north) following techniques developed during Leg 131 (Shipboar d Scientific Party, 1991) and later refined during NanTroSEIZE expeditions on Chikyu (Expedition 315 Scientists, $2009\mathrm{a}$ ; Expedition 31 6 Scientists, 2009; Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010b; Expedition 32 2 Scientists, 2010; Expedition 333 Scientists, 2012; Expedition Scientists 343/343T Scientists, 2013; Strasser et al., $2014{\bf a}$ ; Tobin et al., 2015a).  

To determine the orientations of planes in the core referenc e frame (Figure F12), the apparent dip angle of any planar feature wa s measured in two independent sections parallel to the core axis (Figure F13A), and the true strike and dip in the core reference fram e were determined using a calculation sheet (see Data processing). I n practice, one section is typically the split surface of the core, o n

which the trace of the plane has a bearing $\left(\alpha_{1}\right)$ and a plunge angl e $(\upbeta_{1})$ . $\upalpha_{1}$ is either $90^{\circ}$ or $270^{\circ}$ . The other section is typically a cut o r fractured surface at a high angle to the split core surface, on whic h the bearing $\left(\alpha_{2}\right)$ and plunge angle $({\mathfrak{f}}_{2})$ of the trace of the plane ar e measured. In the case where the second measurement surface i s perpendicular to the core split surface, bearing $\upalpha_{2}$ is either $0^{\circ}$ or $180^{\circ}$ (Figure F13A). Both $\upbeta_{1}$ and $\upbeta_{2}$ are between $0^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ . Similar measurements were made for planar features visible in X-ray CT images.  

Linear features (e.g., slickenlines) were observed on plana r structures (typically fault or shear zone surfaces). Their orientation s were determined in the core reference frame by measuring eithe r

First auxiliary measurement i s done on the flat-lying split core surface and consists of measuring the bearing $\left(\mathfrak{a}_{1}\right)$ and plunge angle $({\mathfrak{f}}_{1})$ of the trace of the plane on the split surface. Second auxiliary measurement is done on a surface that is perpendicular t o the flat-lying split core surface and contains the core axis. It consists of measuring the bearing $\left(\mathsf{a}_{2}\right)$ and plunge angle $({\mathfrak{f}}_{2})$ of the trace of the plane on th e surface. B.

their bearing and plunge or their rakes (or pitches) $\left(\Phi_{\mathrm{a}}\right)$ on th e planes (Figure F13B).  

Descriptive information for individual structures was recorde d with the orientation data described above on the structural geolog y observation sheet based on mesoscopic and microscopic observations using a binocular microscope, thin sections, and SEM as necessary.  

# Data processing  

# Orientation data calculation and true north correction in cores  

Measured orientation data were used to determine strike an d dip in the core reference frame using an Excel spreadsheet developed during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 315, 316, 319, 322, 333, 334, 338, 344, and 348 (see StructureMeasurementSheet_C0024_C0025.xls in CORE in STRUCTURE in Supplementary material; Figure F14) (Expedition 315 Scientists, $2009\mathrm{a}$ ; Expedition 316 Scientists, 2009; Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010b; Expedition 322 Scientists, 2010; Expedition 333 Scientists, 2012; Expedition 334 Scientists, 2012; Harris et al., 2013; Strasser et al., $2014{\bf a}$ ; Tobin et al., 2015a). Based on the measured bearings $\stackrel{\cdot}{\alpha}_{1}$ an d ${\upalpha}_{2})$ ) and plunge angles $\mathrm{[\beta_{1}}$ and $\upbeta_{2}$ , this spreadsheet determines th e strikes and dip angles of the planar features in the core referenc e frame. Because of drilling-induced core fragmentation (e.g., biscuiting) and ensuing core recovery and core preparation, the orientation of the core with respect to the present-day magnetic north i s lost. A correction routine is therefore required to rotate orientations measured in the core reference frame back to the magneti c reference frame. Paleomagnetic data measured using the long-cor e cryogenic magnetometer on Chikyu (see Paleomagnetism) wer e used to correct drilling-induced rotations of cored sediments whenever there was a paleomagnetic datum point within the same coherent interval. If discrete sample paleomagnetic data are available, th e Excel spreadsheet further converts the core reference data to geographic coordinates. The component inclinations, declinations, an d maximum angular deviation values were calculated (see Paleomagnetism). For QC of paleomagnetic correction, a stable maximu m angular deviation component less than $15^{\circ}$ is used for orienting th e structural directions.

# J-CORES structural database  

The J-CORES database has a VCD program to store visual (macroscopic and/or microscopic) descriptions of core structures at  a given section index and a record of planar structures in the core coordinate system. The orientations of such features are saved as commentary notes but do not appear on the plots from the Composit e Log Viewer. During Expedition 358, only the locations of structura l features were entered in the J-CORES database, and orientatio n data management and analyses were performed with the Exce l spreadsheet as described above. For final publication, structural elements were converted to core-scale depictions using Strater software.  

# X-ray computed tomography  

X-ray CT imaging provides information about structural an d sedimentary features in cores and cuttings and helps assess sampl e locations and quality for WR samples. X-ray CT scanning method s followed those in the measurement manual prepared for the Cente r for Deep Earth Exploration by laboratory technicians from Marin e Works Japan (3D X-ray CT Scanning, Version 3.00, 24 March 2015; based on GE Healthcare, 2013a, 2013b, 2013c; Mees et al., 2003; Nakano et al., 2000) and are the same as those followed during previous expeditions (e.g., Strasser et al., $2014\mathrm{a}_{\cdot}$ ). The X-ray CT scanne r on Chikyu is a GE Yokogawa Medical Systems Discovery C T $750\mathrm{HD}$ . This instrument scans a $1.4\,\mathrm{m}$ core section in 10 min: 5 mi n to scan and then 5 min to create, or “reformat,” a coronal image. Images are core-axis-normal planes of X-ray attenuation values wit h dimensions of $512\,\times\,512$ pixels. Each axial scan of a $140~\mathrm{{cm}}$ cor e section consists of approximately 2200 slice images, and each slice i s  

$0.625\ \mathrm{mm}$ thick. Further analysis with a micro-X-ray CT scanne r (ZEISS Xradia 410 Versa, Carl Zeiss Ltd.) was performed on selected cuttings samples at the KCC during Expedition 358. Reconstruction data generated by the Xradia consist of 1000 images wit h $1024\times1000$ (height $\times$ width) pixels. The pixel size and slice thickness corresponded to $15~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ . All data generated by both X-ray C T scanners are stored as Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) formatted files.  

# Background  

The theory behind X-ray CT is well established in medical research and the earth and planetary sciences (Carlson, 2006) and i s only briefly outlined here. X-ray intensity varies as a function of Xray path length and a linear attenuation coefficient (LAC) of the target material:  

$$
I=I_{0}\times\mathrm{e}^{-\upeta L},
$$  

where  

$I=$ transmitted X-ray intensity, $I_{0}={}$ initial X-ray intensity, $\Pi=\operatorname{LAC}$ of the target material, and $L=X$ -ray path length through the material.  

LAC is a function of the chemical composition and density o f the target material. The basic measure of attenuation, or radiodensity, is the CT number given in Hounsfield units (HU):  

$$
\mathrm{{CT}\ n u m b e r=\left[\left(\eta_{\mathrm{t}}-\eta_{\mathrm{w}}\right)/\eta_{\mathrm{w}}\right]\times1000,}
$$  

where  

$\eta_{\mathrm{t}}=\mathrm{LAC}$ for the target material, and $\Pi_{\mathrm{w}}=\mathrm{LAC}$ for water.  

The distribution of raw attenuation values in a given slice is the n used for image processing. Successive 2-D slices yield a representation of attenuation values in 3-D pixels (voxels).  

During Expedition 358, an acrylic three-layer core liner sectio n mock-up (calibration “standard”) was run to calibrate the X-ray C T once every $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ during coring operations. This QC standard is use d to calibrate the CT numbers of air (CT number $=-1000\mathrm{.}$ ), water (C T number $=0_{\cdot}$ ), and aluminum $(2477<C\mathrm{T}$ number $<2487\$ ) when th e “Fast Cal” CT numbers for these three references fall out of normal range. For each standard analysis, the CT number was determine d for a $24.85~\mathrm{mm^{2}}$ area at fixed coordinates near the center of the cylinder. A color scale of CT values ranges between $-1500$ and $+5500$ . The scale was fixed for all X-ray CT scans during Expedition 358.  

# X-ray CT scan data usage  

X-ray CT scans were used for the following during Expeditio n 358:  

• To provide an assessment of core recovery and liner integrity for drilling operations,   
• To provide a data archive of core sections that were taken for WR samples prior to VCD preparation,   
• To determine appropriate locations for WR core samples by avoiding important structural and sedimentological features,   
• To identify the location of subtle features in cuttings or core that warrant detailed study or special handling during visual core description and sampling,   
• To support visual core descriptions and cuttings descriptions in real time through display on computers in the core description laboratory,   
• To distinguish between tectonic and drilling-induced structures, and   
• To determine the 3-D geometry, orientation, and crosscutting relationships of sedimentary, tectonic, and drilling-induced structures.  

X-ray CT scanning was done immediately after core cutting fo r time-sensitive samples to finalize their selection. All whole-roun d sections were screened to avoid destructive testing on intervals tha t may contain interesting structural or sedimentological features. This scanning also facilitated identifying intervals with minima l drilling disturbance for WR sampling and for assessing heterogeneity (essential for postcruise studies of frictional, geotechnical, an d hydrogeological properties).  

Fractures and other planar features identified in the X-ray C T scans were oriented directly from the imagery by measuring strik e in the slice view (perpendicular to the core axis) and one or mor e apparent dips in axial sections (e.g., coronal and sagittal) (Figur e F12). X-ray CT scanning helped reveal features that were cryptic o r indistinguishable during visual core description.  

X-ray CT scans can be used to identify sedimentary and tectoni c features prior to visual core description. 3-D structure orientation i n the core reference frame could easily be determined from X-ray C T scan sections, whereas performing the same measurement on th e cores generally requires cutting orthogonal faces. Furthermore, structures such as shear zones could be classified by contrast in C T number, which is likely related to porosity changes or chemical alteration within shear zones. Structural and stratigraphic observation s are incorporated into the structural geology and lithostratigraph y sections.  

X-ray CT scan data have multiple uses, from early assessment o f cores to description and synthesis. For this reason, several hundre d gigabytes of scan data $({\sim}825\,\mathrm{Mb/m})$ were stored on a local databas e at the OsiriX interpretation station. These data were later archive d to tape and stored on terabyte disks.  

# Biostratigraphy and paleomagnetism  

# Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossils and radiolarian ages were determine d from $100~\mathrm{mL}$ samples of unwashed cuttings collected at $20\;\mathrm{m}$ intervals from Holes C0002Q (2907.5–3257.5 mbsf), C0002R (2817.5– 3077.5 mbsf), C0002S (2847.5–2933.5 mbsf), and C0002T (2836.5– 2847.5 mbsf). Nannofossil analysis was performed on WR cor e samples $\left(5\,\mathrm{\cm}\right)$ collected from core catchers in Holes C0002 T (2837.6–2843.7 mbsf), C0024B (7.1 mbsf), C0024C (7.3 mbsf), C0024D (11.8–119.3 mbsf), C0024E (512.4–618.8 mbsf), C0024 G (106.3–318.9 mbsf), and C0025A (406.2–574.8 mbsf).  

# Calcareous nannofossils  

Cuttings samples $2{-}3~\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ volume) were washed gently wit h freshwater using 1 and $4~\mathrm{mm}$ mesh sieves, and the fractions (1– 4 mm) were dried for $2{-}3\,\mathrm{h}$ in an oven at $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$ . Four grains were selected from the $1{-}4~\mathrm{mm}$ size fraction of each sample for study o f calcareous nannofossils. Each selected grain was cut into two piece s using a razor or diagonal cutting pliers. One of the pieces was use d to prepare a simple smear slide following Bown and Young (1998), and the remaining pieces were preserved in plastic bags. A smea r slide was also made from core catcher samples following standar d procedures and analyzed in the same manner as the cuttings samples.  

Calcareous nannofossils were examined at $1500\times$ magnificatio n under a Nikon E600 polarizing light microscope. Nannofossil preservation was recorded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (little or no evidence of dissolution and/or overgrowth; specimens are identifiable to the species level). • $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (minor dissolution or crystal overgrowth; most specimens are identifiable to the species level). • $\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbb{r}$ (strong dissolution or crystal overgrowth; many specimens are unidentifiable at the species and/or generic level).  

The abundance of total calcareous nannofossils and individua l taxa for each sample was estimated as follows:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant (11 or more specimens per field of view).   
• $C=$ common (1–10 specimens per field of view).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few (1 specimen per 2–10 fields of view).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1 specimen per 11–50 fields of view).   
• ${\mathrm{VR}}=$ very rare (1 specimen per 51 or more fields of view).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren.  

Results were correlated with the calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphic NN zones of Martini (1971), CN zones of Okada an d Bukry (1980), and/or intervals by Young (1998). Furthermore, absolute ages for datums and additional biostratigraphic events were assigned based on Raffi et al. (2006) and/or Backman et al. (2012 ) whenever possible.  

# Radiolarians and foraminifers  

Dried cuttings samples $\left(3\mathrm{-}6\mathrm{~g~}\right.$ of the $1{-}4\;\mathrm{mm}$ size fraction) wer e soaked in a saturated sodium tetraphenylborate $\left(C_{24}\mathrm{H}_{20}\mathrm{BNa}\right)$ solution with sodium chloride $\mathtt{(N a C l)}$ for $16{-}20\,\mathrm{h}$ at room temperature. Disaggregated particles were wet sieved using 63 and $500\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ mes h sieves. Wet residues were spread on one or two glass slides an d dried on a hot plate. The dried residues on the glass slides wer e mounted with Entellan, a new, rapid mounting medium for microscopy. All of the slides were examined with a transmitted light microscope at $100\times$ to $400\times$ magnification.  

Estimates of total radiolarian and foraminifer abundance in  a slide were based on the following categories:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $7500$ specimens in a slide).   
• $C=$ common (100–500 specimens in a slide). • ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (10–99 specimens in a slide).   
• ${\mathrm{VR}}=$ very rare (1–9 specimens in a slide).  

Preservation of the radiolarian and foraminifer specimens wa s based on the following categories:  

• $\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (tests show no sign of dissolution with only minor fragmentation).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (tests show evidence of moderate dissolution with obvious fragmentation).   
• $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{poor}$ (tests show signs of a high degree of dissolution with very little intact nature).  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic and rock magnetic analyses were conducted t o determine  the  characteristic  remanence  directions  for  use  i n magnetostratigraphic and structural studies. Archive halves an d discrete samples were measured with the superconducting roc k magnetometer (SRM). Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS ) in discrete samples was measured with a magnetic susceptibilit y meter.  

# Laboratory instruments  

The paleomagnetism laboratory on Chikyu houses a large $\lvert7.3\,\mathrm{m}$ $\times\ 2.8\:\mathrm{~m~}\times\:1.9\:\mathrm{~m~}$ ) magnetically shielded room with its long axi s athwartship. The total magnetic field inside the room is ${\sim}1\%$ o f Earth’s magnetic field. The room is large enough to comfortabl y handle standard IODP core sections $(\sim\!1.5\mathrm{~m)}$ . The shielded roo m houses all the equipment and instruments described in this section.  

# Superconducting rock magnetometer  

The long-core SRM is a liquid helium–free cooling system (4  K SRM; WSGI); the $4\;\mathrm{K}$ SRM uses a Cryomech pulse tube cryocoole r to achieve the required $4\;\mathrm{K}$ operating temperatures without the us e of any liquid helium. The differences between the pulse tube coole d system and the liquid helium cooled magnetometers significantl y impact the system in terms of ease of use, convenience, safety, an d long-term reliability. The SRM system is $\mathord{\sim}6\;\mathrm{m}$ long with an $8.1~\mathrm{{cm}}$ diameter access bore. A $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ split core liner can pass through th e magnetometer, alternating field demagnetizer, and anhysteretic remanent magnetizer. The system includes three sets of superconducting pickup coils: two for transverse moment measuremen t $x-$ and $y$ -axes) and one for axial moment measurement ( $\scriptstyle{z}$ -axis). The noise level of the magnetometer is ${<}10^{-7}\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ for a $10\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ volume rock. An automated sample handler system (2G800) include d in the magnetometer consists of aluminum and fiberglass channel s designated to support and guide long-core movement. The core itself is positioned in a nonmagnetic fiberglass carriage that is pulle d through the channels by a rope attached to a geared high-torqu e stepper motor. A 2G600 sample degaussing system is coupled to th e SRM to allow automatic demagnetization of samples up to $100\;\mathrm{mT}$ . The system is controlled by an external computer and allows programming of a complete sequence of measurements and degaus s cycles without removing the long core from the holder.  

# Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility  

The Kappabridge KLY 3S (AGICO, Inc.), which measures AMS , is also available on Chikyu. Data are acquired from spinning measurements around three axes perpendicular to each other. Deviatoric susceptibility tensor can then be computed, and an additional measurement for bulk susceptibility completes the sequence. Sensitivity for AMS measurement is $2\times10^{-8}\;\mathrm{SI}.$ . Intensity and frequenc y of the field applied are $300~\mathrm{mA/m}$ and ${875~\mathrm{Hz}},$ respectively. Thi s system also includes a temperature control unit (CS-3/CS-L) fo r temperature variation of low-field magnetic susceptibility of samples.  

# Discrete samples and sampling coordinates  

Because demagnetization levels on archive halves are limited t o the lower level $\left({\sim}20\;\mathrm{mT}\right)$ , one cubic sample $({\sim}7~\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ was taken pe r 1–3 sections from coherent intervals of the working halves to confirm the results of paleomagnetic analysis on archive halves a t higher and closer demagnetization levels. The relation between th e orientation of archive section and that of a cube sample is shown i n Figure F15.

# Magnetic reversal stratigraphy  

Whenever possible, magnetic polarity interpretations are provided using the naming convention following that of correlativ e anomaly numbers prefaced by the letter C (Tauxe et al., 1984). Normal polarity subchrons are referred to by adding suffixes (e.g., n1, n2, etc.) that increase with age. For the younger part of the timescal e (Pliocene–Pleistocene), we often use traditional names to refer t o the various chrons and subchrons (e.g., Brunhes, Jaramillo, Olduvai, etc.). In general, polarity reversals occurring at core ends wer e treated with extreme caution. The ages of the polarity intervals use d during Expedition 358 are a composite of four previous magneti c polarity timescales (magnetostratigraphic timescale for Neogene b y Lourens et al. [2004]).  

# Geochemistry  

# Shipboard mud-gas monitoring system  

# Mud-gas monitoring system  

The real-time mud-gas monitoring system is a powerful too l used to quantify in situ gaseous components, especially durin g superdeep drilling operations. In the framework of IODP, mud-ga s monitoring was carried out during Expedition 319 (Expedition 31 9 Scientists, 2010a, 2010b) using third-party tools, as well as durin g Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 337, 338, and 34 8 with shipboard instruments (Expedition 337 Scientists, 2013; Hammerschmidt et al., 2014; Strasser et al., $2014{\mathrm{a}}$ ; Tobin et al., 2015a).  

Formation gas is liberated when the drill bit crushes sediment o r rock. In a riser system, the liberated gas flows up to the ship with th e drilling mud water (Figure F16), which is fed along a recycling system to a degasser.  

# Improvement of the degasser system  

During previous expeditions, a degasser (“Standard Traps”; Geoservices) was placed downstream from a flow splitter connected t o the Gumbo separator (Gumbo degasser; Figure F17). The syste m had major problems with cuttings jamming at the inlet of the degasser, which resulted in poor quality data (e.g., causing flood trappin g and air contamination). The Gumbo degasser jammed several time s during the previous  expeditions. It was difficult  not only t o promptly find the jam but also to remove the cuttings from th e Gumbo degasser. To resolve this problem, the degasser, which wa s replaced with a new one (constant-volume degasser provided b y Geoservices), was relocated to the mud chamber downstream fro m the Gumbo separator (Trough degasser; Figure F17). The new degasser has a sealed degassing tank (Figure F18). Mud water wa s pumped into the degassing tank at a constant rate $(1.5\ \mathrm{L/min})$ vi a the mud suction probe, and “zero air” was pumped into the tank at  a rate of ${\sim}500\,\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{min}$ through a PVC tube to generate bubbles in th e mud water at the same time. Zero air was made by a zero gas generator (GC-1500; LNI Schmidlin SA), which was set up in the MGM L (Figure F19). The zero gas generator removed hydrocarbons an d carbon monoxide from the air supplied by an onboard air compressor. An agitator in the degasser tank stirred the bubbles to stimulat e degassing from the mud water. The liberated gas from the crushe d sediment/rock along with the zero air filled the headspace of the degassing tank. The gas in the headspace was pumped into the MGM L via a PVC tube at ${\sim}500\,\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{min}$ . It takes $4\,\mathrm{min}$ and $50\,\mathrm{s}$ to transpor t the mud gas from the degasser to the MGML. On the way to th e MGML, the gas passed through mud and water traps that preven t invasion of mud and water into the MGML system (Figures F18, F19). If the mud trap or PVC tube was jammed with cuttings, th e

Drilling mud–bearing gas at top of drill bit is pumped out by the mud pump and flows along mudline to a degasser, where gas i s extracted and forwarded to mud-gas monitoring laboratory. Degasser was placed downstream from Gumbo separator during this expedition. After separatin g the gas, drilling mud flows to a shale shaker, where cuttings are removed. Mud is recovered into mud tanks and is pumped downhole again. $\mathsf{H}\mathsf{C}=$ hydrocarbon, GC-FID $=$ gas chromatograph–flame ionization detector, $\mathsf{G N}4=$ Geoservices mud logging data acquisition system.

Figure F18. Newly installed degasser, Expedition 358. Degasser has a sealed degassing tank to avoid atmospheric contamination. Zero air is pressurized fro m mud-gas monitoring laboratory (MGML) at ${\sim}500\ m L/\min$ to generate bubbles, and released gas is vacuumed up to MGML at $\mathord{\sim}500\;\mathrm{m}|$ L/min from the tank.

inflow rate of mud gas to the MGML would change. Therefore, it i s important to closely monitor the flow rate and pressure of mud ga s to notice jamming as soon as possible. In addition, the inlet of th e zero air into the degassing tank is routinely cleaned using a stick every ${\sim}24\,\mathrm{h}$ (Figure F18).  

In the previous degasser system used during Expeditions 337, 338, and 348, the degassing chamber was equipped with an agitato r directly sunk into the mud stream, and the depth of the chambe r from the mud flow surface was manually adjusted. This configuration resulted in variable gas sampling volumes. In addition, mud ga s was pumped from the chamber without the zero air flow; as a result, mud condition often affected degassing efficiency. To solve these issues, in the new system installed for this expedition, mud water i s pumped into the degasser tank via a mud suction probe at a constant rate independent from the drilling conditions such as the variable rig pump rates and mud level in the mud return circuit. I n

Mud gas is separated into two lines: (1) part of the gas is dried and distributed t o methane carbon isotope analyzer (MCIA), gas chromatograph (GC)–natural gas analyzer (NGA) with flame ionization detector and thermal conductivity detector, Rn detector, and process gas mass spectrometer (PGMS) quadruple mass filter to measure gas compositions and methane carbon isotopic compositio n and (2) part of the gas is directed through IsoTube sampling system to sampling line, which consists of glass flasks and copper tubes for personal sampling. P S $=$ pressure sensor, $\mathsf{N V}=$ needle valve, $\mathsf{F M=}$ flowmeter, $\vee=$ valve, $\mathsf{P R}=$ pump right (spare pump below V1R shown in flow diagram is named PL originally, reflecting in situ location), $\mathsf{P S}_{\mathsf{D I F}}=$ pressure sensor difference (not absolute pressure), $\mathsf{P S}_{\mathsf{D U}}=$ pressure sensor for dry sample located upstream, $\mathsf{P S}_{\mathsf{D D}}=$ pressur e sensor for dry sample located downstream, $\mathsf{P S}_{\mathsf{M I}}=$ pressure sensor mud gas in, $\mathsf{P S}_{\mathsf{W U}}=$ pressure sensor for wet sample located upstream, $\mathsf{P S}_{\mathsf{W D}}=$ pressure senso r for wet sample located downstream.

addition, the new degasser, in which sample gas is purged by zer o air, allows constant degassing efficiency independent of mud parameters (density, viscosity, solids content, etc.).  

However, it should be noted that the dilution by zero air lower s the apparent total mud-gas concentrations from those obtained b y the previous degasser systems. Such a dilution effect is likely responsible for the low methane concentration observed in Hol e C0002Q. To enhance the apparent gas concentration (i.e., degassin g efficiency) before drilling operations in Hole C0002R started, th e mud suction probe was moved to a more downstream position toward where the Geoservices degasser was installed (Figure F17).  

# Analysis and sampling flow in MGML  

After the arrival of mud gas in the MGML, the gas flow was separated into two lines (Figure F19). One line was fed into a dehydrator (NH-80; Niscon) and then the dried gas was carried to th e shipboard analyzing apparatus: methane carbon isotope ratio analyzer  (MCIA),  gas  chromatograph  (GC)–natural  gas  analyze r (NGA), radon meter, and process gas mass spectrometer (PGMS). The other line was used for personal sampling without desiccation.  

# Shipboard mud-gas analysis Methane carbon isotope ratio by cavity ring-down spectrometer  

The first instrument to analyze the gas in the MGML is a n MCIA (Los Gatos Research, Model 908-0005), which measure s methane concentrations and methane carbon isotope ratios at  a sampling frequency of $1\:\mathrm{Hz}$ by cavity ring-down spectroscopy. Th e stable carbon isotopic composition of methane is reported i n $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CH4}}$ notation relative to the Vienna Peedee belemnite (VPDB ) standard as expressed in parts per thousand (permil):  

$$
\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CH4}}=[(R_{\mathrm{sample}}-R_{\mathrm{VPDB}})/R_{\mathrm{VPDB}}]\times1000,
$$  

where  

$$
R_{\mathrm{VPDB}}=0.0112372\pm2.9.
$$  

Calibration was carried out prior to the expedition using standard gas (Liso-1; $\mathrm{[CH_{4}]}$ : $2500\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{\ppm}}$ in atmospheric air, $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CH4}}$ : $-66.5\%_{00}\,\pm\,0.3\%_{0}$ VPDB). Analytical condition was checked once  a day by manually injecting the same standard gas. Methane concentrations and methane carbon isotope ratios were continuously monitored at a gas flow rate of ${\sim}110\,\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{min}$ .  

The MCIA is able to analyze methane concentrations from 50 0 to $10{,}000\ \mathrm{ppm}$ (Range 2) with a built-in dynamic dilution syste m that can extend the upper detection limit to 100 times highe r (https://www.et.co.uk/assets/resources/datasheets/Methane%20Carbon%20Isotope%20Analyser%20MCIA%20Prod  

$\mathbf{uct^{0}/o20D}$ atasheet.pdf). Methane carbon isotope ratios cannot b e reliably determined when the concentration is lower than $\mathord{\sim}500$ ppm, which was the threshold used during Expedition 337 (Expedition 337 Scientists, 2013) and this expedition (see next paragrap h for details). Therefore, it is recommended not to use or rely on th e methane carbon isotope data when the concentration is lower tha n ${\sim}500\,\mathrm{ppm}$ . Some methane concentrations measured during Expedition 358 were below this value, especially gases from Hole C0002R. We included all the methane carbon isotope data in the report eve n when methane concentrations are lower than $500\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{\ppm}}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , but th e $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CH4}}$ data with concentrations lower than $500\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{\ppm}}$ were excluded from the figures. Extreme caution is needed when interpreting methane carbon isotope data of the samples including methan e less than $500\,\mathrm{\,ppm}$ .  

To evaluate the precision and accuracy of the isotopic measurements, especially when methane concentration is low, the carbo n isotopic composition of standard gas concentrations was measure d under two setup conditions. In the first setup, the evaluation wa s carried out by batch analysis for the standard gas (Liso-1) that wa s used for the daily condition check. $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CH4}}$ was measured on on e batch of undiluted standard gas $(2500\ \mathrm{ppm})$ ) and batches of $\Nu_{2}$ -diluted standard gases with methane concentrations of 500 and 25 0 ppm. During the batch analysis, the sample gas was manually introduced by syringe and analyzed in the closed cell of the MCIA for  2 min (Figure F20A–F20C). The standard deviation of the $2\,\textrm{m i n}$ measurement (120 data points) is seven times larger for the 25 0 ppm batch compared to the 2500 ppm batch (Figure F20A–F20C) . The average $\delta^{13}C$ values of the $2500\;\mathrm{ppm}$ batch $\left(-67.4\%_{0}\right)$ was consistent with the known $\delta^{13}C$ value of Liso-1 $(-66.5)$ , which varies b y $\pm0.6\%_{00}$ (1σ) during the daily condition check. However, those of th e 500 and $250\;\mathrm{ppm}$ batches $'-68.9\%_{0}$ and $-72.6\%_{0}$ , respectively) wer e consistently lower than the known value.

VPDB $=$ Vienna Peedee belemnite.  

The other setup was conducted for continuously flowing gas t o simulate the routine mud-gas analysis. Both Liso-1 and Tiso- 3 ( $\mathrm{[CH_{4}]}$ : $250~\mathrm{ppm}$ , $\delta^{13}C$ : $-38.5\%_{00}\,\pm\,0.2\%_{0}$ ) were used for calibration. The 60 s flow analyses of both gases showed worse precision an d accuracy for the low-concentration gas compared to the high-concentration gas (Figure F20D). The average $\delta^{13}C$ value of the lowconcentration Tiso-3 was $5.1\%_{0}$ lower than the reported value with  a standard deviation of $3.7\%_{0}$ . On the contrary, the average $\delta^{13}C$ valu e of the high-concentration Liso-1 is only $0.1\%_{0}$ higher than the reported value with a relatively small standard deviation of $0.6\%_{00}$ . Th e accuracy of the analytical results for the low-concentration gas improved when the duration of the analyses was increased to $350\,{\bf s};$ ; th e average $\delta^{13}C$ value of the Tiso-3 was only $1\%_{0}$ lower than the know n value (Figure F20E). The precision, however, did not change muc h $3.7\%_{0}$ vs. $4.0\%_{\mathrm{{.}}}$ ; Figure F20D, F20E). A deviation as high as ${\sim}5\%_{0}$ from the known value was observed in the test on 250 ppm gas. These results revealed that both the precision and accuracy of th e analyses significantly deteriorated when the methane concentratio n was too low.  

# Inorganic and organic gases by gas chromatography  

The second instrument along the gas flow line in the MGML is  a GC-NGA (Agilent Technologies 6890N Network GC system ) equipped with a gas sampling port that has a multiposition valv e (Wasson ECE instrumentation). In principle, the GC-NGA can analyze hydrocarbon gases (methane, ethane, propane, iso- $/n$ -butane, and pentane [i.e., $C_{1}-C_{5}].$ ) with a flame ionization detector (FID ) and nonhydrocarbon gases $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ He, $\mathrm{O}_{2},\,\mathrm{N}_{2},$ CO, and $\mathbf{CO}_{2},$ ) with  a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). During Expeditions 338 an d 348, nitrogen was used as the carrier gas so that He could be quantified (Strasser et al., $2014{\bf a}_{\mathrm{i}}$ ; Tobin et al., 2015a). However, the nitrogen carrier decreased the instrument sensitivity to He. Thus, Ar wa s used as the carrier gas during Expedition 358 to detect He at  a higher sensitivity than using nitrogen as a carrier gas because Ar ha s a larger contrast in thermal conductivity to He compared to nitrogen. In addition, oxygen concentrations could also be determine d using Ar as a carrier. As a result, we were not able to detect Ar in ou r samples using the GC-NGA.  

After flowing into the GC-NGA, the gas is introduced separatel y into the two sample loops with volumes of 1 and $0.1~\mathrm{mL}$ . The $1~\mathrm{mL}$ sample loop flows through an 8 ft capillary column (Wasson EC E Instrumentation, column 8 ft KM1 Slico) to roughly separate th e different fractions of gaseous components. When the fractions o f gas, except for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ , exit this capillary column, they are diverte d with a valve and introduced into another $50\,\textrm{m}$ capillary colum n (Wasson Column $4\ \mathrm{KC126}\ 50\ \mathrm{m}\times0.53\ \mathrm{mm},\,22473)$ , in which th e gas fractions are separately eluted according to their retention time s in sequence of He, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ , $\mathrm{O}_{2},\,\mathrm{N}_{2},$ and CO. The gas concentrations ar e then quantified by TCD. The sampled gas in the $0.1~\mathrm{mL}$ loop flow s through a $50~\mathrm{{cm}}$ capillary column (Wasson ECE Instrumentation, column Code 2378) that retains pentane. Upon turning a valve, th e sample gas including methane, ethane, propane, and iso- $/n$ -butan e flows into another $49\,\mathrm{m}$ capillary column (Wasson ECE Instrumentation, column Code 2378). The gas fractions are separately elute d based on their retention times, and the concentrations are quantified by FID. The retained gas fraction in the previous $50\,\mathrm{cm}$ colum n was backflushed and introduced directly into the FID to reduce th e analysis time of pentane.  

The GC-NGA was more frequently used during Expedition 35 8   
because of the successful reduction of measurement time from 2 7  

min per sample during previous expeditions to $12\ \mathrm{min}$ per sampl e during this expedition by GC method improvements (i.e., change d temperature program and column). The continuous gas flow rat e was $50\;\mathrm{mL/min}$ . Calibration was conducted at the beginning of th e expedition by using two standard gas samples. The mixture of standard permanent gases for the calibration contained $1\%$ of Ar, CO, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ , $C\mathrm{O}_{2},$ and He in $\Nu_{2}$ . The hydrocarbon standard gas mixtur e contained $1\%$ each of $C_{1}{\mathrm{-}}C_{5}$ in $\Nu_{2}$ $(95\%)$ . During the expedition, th e same standard gases were used to check the analytical condition every $24~\mathrm{~h~}$ . If the measured concentrations of the daily conditio n check deviated $>\!5\%$ from the reported values, the calibration wa s conducted again. Despite daily calibration checks, during the drilling of Hole C0002Q $\Nu_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ concentrations were not precisel y calibrated because of the large difference between the concentrations in the mud gas and standard gas. To avoid the same issue, another standard gas containing $78\%$ $\mathrm{N}_{2},$ $21\%$ $\mathrm{O}_{2},$ $0.9\%$ Ar, and 30 5 ppm $C O_{2}$ was used to calibrate $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ $\mathrm{O}_{2},$ and $C O_{2}$ when drillin g started in Hole C0002R.  

The detection limits of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $C O_{2}$ for the GC-NGA were estimated by analyzing the atmospheric air in the MGML, which ha s ${\sim}17$ ppm $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and ${\sim}700\mathrm{~ppm~CO_{2}},$ , significantly higher values tha n those in open atmospheric air (500 ppb $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $400\;\mathrm{ppm}\,\mathrm{CO}_{2})$ . Th e higher concentrations of these gases are likely due to $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production by instruments such as the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ generator, gas pumps, G C oven, and so on. The detection limits were estimated to be $12\,\mathrm{ppm}$ for $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $160~\mathrm{ppm}$ for $C O_{2}$ . We could not estimate the detectio n limits for the other trace gases such as Xe, He, and CO because th e TCD attached to the GC-NGA could not detect these gases in th e atmospheric air sample.  

# Online radon analysis  

Radon $(\mathbb{R}\mathfrak{n})$ concentration was measured by an Rn meter (Saphymo GmbH; AlphaGUARD Professional), which measures th e ionized Rn concentration in a $650~\mathrm{mL}$ ionization chamber (effectiv e volume is ${\sim}500~\mathrm{mL}$ ). Measurements were carried out continuously, and the concentration was expressed as counts per minute average d over a $10\,\mathrm{\min}$ period. Analytical error calculated from repeate d measurements was $100\,\mathrm{Bq}/\mathrm{m}^{3}$ in the concentration range of 2 to $2\times$ $10^{6}~\mathrm{Bq}/\mathrm{m}^{3}$ . Temperature, pressure, and relative humidity of the ai r in the chamber were monitored and used to calculate the ionizatio n efficiency to correct the Rn concentration. Calibration was conducted in the factory, and no further calibration was required on th e ship.  

# Online gas analysis by process gas mass spectrometer  

Helium, $\mathrm{O}_{2},$ Ar, Xe, $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ CO, $C O_{2},$ and $\mathrm{{CH}_{4}}$ were continuousl y monitored by a PGMS (AMETEK Process Instruments Dycor ProLine). The PGMS includes a quadruple mass filter that identifie s molecular masses of the targeted gases. Similar to Expeditions 33 8 and 348 (Strasser et al., $2014{\mathrm{a}}$ ; Tobin et al., 2015a), reduction o f dwell time to $120~\mathrm{ms}$ allowed a sampling interval of $4\,s$ .  

To obtain high-quality data, the following five-step calibratio n was conducted every $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ :  

1. Pure Ar and $\Nu_{2}$ gases were used to check the background noise level of the PGMS.   
2. Standard cylinder air was used as a standard gas for calibrating $\mathrm{O}_{2},$ $\mathrm{N}_{2},$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ .   
3. A mixture of inorganic gases was used as a standard gas for calibration of Ar, CO, Xe, $\mathrm{O}_{2},\mathrm{CO}_{2},$ and He.  

4. Standard organic gas, which included $C_{1}{\mathrm{-}}C_{4}$ hydrocarbon gases, was used to calibrate methane concentrations. 5. ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ standard gas diluted with $C O_{2}$ was also used for calibration of methane.  

The measured concentrations (or intensities) of $\mathrm{N}_{2},\mathrm{O}_{2},$ Ar, $C O_{2},$ $\mathrm{{CH}_{4},}$ CO, and He were normalized to the total amount of thes e seven gases assuming that only these gases were present. Therefore, the resulting concentrations may be overestimated if there was another significant gas component present.  

# Data processing for mud-gas monitoring  

All the data determined by the MCIA, GC-NGA, PGMS, and R n meter were recorded in a data storage system (SSX database) together with other drilling parameters at a recording frequency of  1 Hz. It should be noted that the SSX database continuously recorde d data even when the drilling and/or mud flow pumps were disrupted. Data collected during such times were invalid for further scientifi c interpretation. We therefore selected only data obtained during increasing lag depth (i.e., normal drilling conditions). After this preliminary screening, the data were visually checked to find anomalies, which would be subject to further examination. Daily checks of th e instrument condition in the MGML and disruptions in drilling operations were recorded as events by shipboard scientists. Data collected during the time of these events are not included in the final results.  

# Gas analysis  

# Sampling cored sediment for headspace gas analysis  

For headspace analysis, $\mathrm{{\sim}}5~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ sediment was sampled from th e bottom of Section 1 in each core (or from the top of Section 2 whe n the sediment was disturbed at the bottom of Section 1) using a cutoff disposable plastic syringe (volume $=3\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}.$ ) or a stainless stee l cork borer when the sediment became too hard for the plastic syringe. When drilling progressed to deeper layers, sediment becam e too hard for the cork borer. Such sediment was crushed using  a chisel, and several pieces of the crushed sediment totaling $\mathrm{{\sim}5~c m^{3}}$ were picked. The sediment sample was placed in a glass vial (2 0 $\mathsf{c m}^{3},$ ) sterilized by baking at $450^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $4~\mathrm{h}$ prior to its use. The via l was then immediately capped by a butyl rubber septum coated wit h polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and an aluminum cap. The buty l rubber septa were also sterilized at $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $4~\mathrm{h}$ before use. Th e precise mass of the wet sample was determined after gas analysi s was finished.  

# Sampling sediment from cuttings for headspace gas analysis  

Two ${\sim}5~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ sediment samples were taken from unwashed cuttings using a $3~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ cut-off disposable plastic syringe to analyze th e headspace gas by GC-FID and GC–pulsed discharge helium ionization detector (PDHID). The sediment samples were placed in 2 0 $\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ glass vials, which were sterilized at $450^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $4~\mathrm{h}$ before use. The vials were then immediately sealed with a butyl rubber septu m and an aluminum cap. The butyl rubber septa were also sterilized a t $100^{\circ}C$ for $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ prior to the use.  

# Sampling gas for void gas analysis  

When gas-rich sediment was recovered as a core on deck, dissolved gases in IW formed bubbles at atmospheric low pressure an d high temperature compared to that from deep-sea environments. As a result, the sediment expanded and formed voids that contai n free gas. Gas samples were taken from these voids through a needl e attached to a gas-tight syringe (SGE Analytical Science; 100MR  

VLLMA-GT) filled with Milli-Q water. The void gas was isolated b y closing the stopcock of the gas-tight syringe and transferred to tw o sealed $20~\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ vials under vacuum using a diaphragm pum p (ULVAC; DTC-22). Because the pressure of the void gas sample i s usually higher than the ambient atmospheric pressure, the concentrations of hydrocarbon gases will be overestimated when analyzin g these pressurized samples. To avoid this, the septa of the void ga s sample vials were pierced by a needle to reduce the inner pressur e to one atmosphere pressure (1 atm).  

# GC-FID hydrocarbon concentrations  

Low–molecular weight hydrocarbons (i.e., methane, ethane , propane, and iso- $/n$ -butane) were analyzed by GC-FID (Agilen t 7890B) equipped with an autosampler (Agilent Technologies 7697 A headspace sampler). Before analysis of headspace gas, the vial containing sample sediment was heated at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $30\ \mathrm{min}$ . For bot h headspace and vacuum-sampled gases, the sample gas in the vial was replaced by pressurized He at 15 psi and transferred to a $1~\mathrm{mL}$ sample loop through a needle. The sample gas was then injecte d into a capillary column (HP-PLOT $\mathrm{Q};30\,\mathrm{m}$ length, $0.53\:\mathrm{mm}$ outsid e diameter, $40\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ film) of the GC-FID. The flow rate of the He carrie r gas was $5~\mathrm{mL/min}$ . The GC oven was programmed to increase th e temperature from an initial temperature of $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at  a rate o f $10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ to $150^{\circ}C$ (run time: $9\;\mathrm{{min}}$ ) after sample injection to elut e the different gas fractions at different temperatures. Calibration wa s conducted once at the beginning of the expedition using standar d gases containing $1\%\,{\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ and standard hydrocarbons $\overset{1.02\%}{\cdot}$ ethane , $1.00\%$ propane, $1.02\%$ propylene, $1.02\%$ $_n$ -butane, $1.01\%$ iso-butane, and $1.03\%$ ethylene) in $\Nu_{2}$ gas. Condition check measurements wer e carried out every day using $1\%\,\mathrm{CH_{4}}$ in $\Nu_{2}$ gas. The reproducibility o f the analytical results was within $2.10\%$ , $2.16\%$ , $2.20\%$ , $2.23\%$ , an d $2.14\%$ for methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, and $_n$ -butane, respectively $\left(N=38\right)$ .  

# GC-PDHID hydrogen and carbon monoxide concentrations  

Hydrogen gas and CO concentrations were determined usin g the GC-PDHID (Agilent 7890B) equipped with a capillary colum n (HP-PLOT Molesieve; $30~\mathrm{m}\times\,0.53~\mathrm{mm}\times\,50~\mathrm{{\mum}}$ film). The gas introduction system was similar to that of the GC-FID. A $20\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ via l containing a sediment sample was placed in a headspace sample r (Agilent Technologies 7697A headspace sampler), and the headspace gas was automatically injected into the GC-PDHID after heating the samples at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $30\;\mathrm{min}$ with He carrier gas at a flow rat e of $3\mathrm{~mL/min}$ . The GC oven temperature was programmed so tha t the initial temperature was $40^{\circ}C_{\iota}$ , held for $7\,\mathrm{min}$ , and then increase d to $180^{\circ}C$ in $15~\mathrm{min}$ . The temperature of the PDHID was $200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  A standard gas containing 4020 ppm $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and 99.7 ppm CO in $\Nu_{2}$ wa s used for both calibration and condition check measurements. Calibration was conducted once at the beginning of the expedition wit h repeated checks carried out every day. The analytical errors wer e $2.0\%$ for $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $3.0\%$ for CO $(N=77)$ .  

# Chemical analysis of interstitial water Interstitial water collection  

IW samples were collected from sediments from Sites C002 4 and C0025 for a range of shipboard and shore-based analyses. Th e methods summarized below are based on those reported for IOD P Expedition 370 (Morono et al., 2017). When sufficient cored sediment was recovered, two WR IW samples per section were collected from the first three cores from Holes C0024B and C0024D t o better define the location of the sulfate–methane transition, an d one WR sediment sample was collected from each core thereafte r for IW analyses. A summary of core length and IW recovery i s shown in Table T8.  

A total of 66 WRs were taken from 63 cores (Table T8) on th e core processing deck with approval from the Science Leader o n duty. Whole-round core sediments with lengths of $13{-}36~\mathrm{cm}$ wer e selected to provide enough fluid to meet the minimum needs fo r shipboard and personal IW analyses (ideally ${\geq}22~\mathrm{mL}$ ) while maximizing the core available for other research purposes. Each wholeround section for IW sampling was curated and delivered for scanning by X-ray CT to examine drilling disturbance or areas of interest for sedimentology or structural geology. After approval by th e Science Leader, the sample was delivered to the sample preparatio n room for further treatment. The cored sediment was taken out o f the core liner, cleaned by scraping off drilling-contaminated rind s along the outer edges and/or fractures of the cores, put in a modified $9\ \mathrm{cm}$ diameter Manheim titanium squeezer (Manheim an d Sayles, 1974) on top of a filter paper rinsed by deionized water (18. 2 MΩ Millipore water), and placed on top of two 320 mesh stainles s steel screens. This part of the processing was done in a $\Nu_{2}$ -fille d glove bag to minimize oxidation of highly reactive materials including $\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$ and reduced sulfur compounds. The sample sediment s were squeezed at room temperature and pressures not exceedin g  

25,000 psi to avoid extracting interlayer clay waters. The IW wa s collected in a $60\;\mathrm{mL}$ acid-washed plastic syringe.  

Aliquots of IW were distributed into glass and plastic vials afte r filtering through a $0.45\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ disposable PTFE filter for further analyses. Aliquots for shipboard major, minor, and trace componen t analyses and some personal samples were stored in acid-washed  4 mL plastic vials. The plastic vials, made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), were used after cleaning by immersion for $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ i n $10\%$ trace metal grade 12 M HCl and subsequently rinsed in Milli- Q water in a class 100 laminar flow clean hood. The samples for mino r and trace element analysis by inductively coupled plasma–mas s spectrometry (ICP-MS) or inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and some personal samples wer e acidified with a drop of 6 M HCl (TAMAPURE-100 grade) withi n $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ after IW sampling. The collected samples were stored at $4^{\circ}C$ . Some aliquots for personal requests were stored in $2~\mathrm{mL}$ glass vial s sealed with PTFE crimp caps. The glass vials and PTFE crimp cap s were baked at $450^{\circ}$ and $100^{\circ}C$ , respectively, for $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ before use. Som e other personal request samples were also stored in the glass vials i n which $2\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of $\mathrm{HgCl}$ was added to $0.5\,\mathrm{mL}$ sample before sealing.

After IW was extracted, each sediment squeeze cake was divided for archive (stored at $4^{\circ}C$ ) and shore-based research (stored a t $-20^{\circ},4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , or room temperature).  

# IW analyses  

The salinity of IW was routinely analyzed using a RX-5000i refractometer (Atago), which reports the refractive index of IW, immediately after the extraction. The refractive index was converte d to salinity by referral to the repeated analytical results of International Association of Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) standard seawater (salinity $=\ 34.993\$ ). The standard deviation of th e daily measurements of IAPSO standard seawater is equivalent t o $0.04\:\mathrm{kg/kg}$ salinity.  

Immediately after IW extraction, $\mathsf{p H}$ and alkalinity were analyzed by Gran titration using a Metrohm 888 Titrando. An aliquo t of $1.0{-}3.0~\mathrm{mL}$ IW adjusted to $3.0~\mathrm{mL}$ with $0.7\mathrm{~M~}$ KCl solution wa s titrated with nominal $0.1\;\mathrm{M}\;\mathrm{HCl}$ at $25\mathrm{{^\circC}}$ . A $100\;\mathrm{mM}$ $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ solution was used for calibration of the acid each week. Quality check s were conducted twice per day using a $50\;\mathrm{mM}$ solution of $\mathrm{NaHCO_{3}}$ and 0.1 M HCl. When the sample volume was small, $\mathsf{p H}$ was analyzed using a compact $\mathsf{p H}$ meter (Horiba LAQUAtwin). The reproducibility of $\mathsf{p H}$ is $\pm0.1$ .  

Sulfate and $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ concentrations in IW were analyzed by ion chromatography (Thermo Fisher Scientific ICS-2100) after dilutin g 1:100 with Milli-Q water. The column oven was set at $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The eluent solution was $40\ \mathrm{mM}$ potassium hydroxide. A calibration curv e was prepared for every measurement batch by using a series of diluted IAPSO standard seawater (0.01:100, 0.05:100, 0.1:100, 0.5:100, 1:100, and 1:50 diluted with Milli- $\cdot\mathrm{\boldmath~Q~}$ water). IAPSO standard seawater (1:100 diluted) was also measured after every ${\sim}10$ sampl e measurements as a condition check reference. Reproducibility of B r and $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ is $3.7\%$ and $0.18\%$ , respectively.  

Chlorinity was determined via titration of $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ water with silver nitrate $\mathrm{(AgNO_{3})}$ . Here, the term “chlorinity” means the tota l concentration  of  reacting  components  with  the  titrant.  Th e Metrohm 888 Titrando with a Metrohm Ag electrode was used fo r the analysis. The $\mathrm{AgNO_{3}}$ titrant was nominally 0.01 M. Standardization was based on replicate analyses of IAPSO Batch P162 (salinit y $=34.993\$ ; chlorinity $=559.47\;\mathrm{mM}$ at the typical ambient laborator y temperature of $21.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ ). The precision of the chlorinity titrations expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD) of IAPSO standar d seawater was $\pm0.36\%$ .  

Ammonium and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{\ 3-}$ concentrations were measured by colorimetry using an automated spectrophotometer (SEAL Analytica l AQ2 discrete analyzer) within $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ after IW sampling. The AQ2 i s equipped with a stepper motor–driven syringe for sampling,  a quartz-halogen lamp, a flow-through cuvette $(50~\upmu\mathrm{L})$ , and a photodiode. The analytical procedure is based on absorption spectroscopy of indophenol blue for $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ measurement and that o f ammonium molybdate for $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ measurement. Indophenol blue i s formed by reaction of ammonium with the diazotization of pheno l and subsequent oxidation of the diazo compound by sodium hypochlorite. Samples and reagents were taken into reaction segment s with the sampling probe and warmed to $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $8\;\mathrm{min}$ to enhanc e color development. Then the colored solution was transferred t o the cuvette and absorbance at $620~\mathrm{nm}$ was measured. Ammoniu m molybdate and potassium antimonyl tartrate reacted with orthophosphate in an acid medium to form an antimony-phosphomolybdate complex, which, on reduction with ascorbic acid, yielded a n intense blue color suitable for photometric measurement at $880\,\mathrm{nm}$ All operations, including sample dilution, color development, measurement, and calculation, were automated and controlled by operation software. Concentrations were calculated based on a standar d calibration curve determined before each analytical run. The standard solution was measured after every five samples to check th e analytical precision (QC). The RSDs of replicate analyses of th e $0.071\ \upmu\mathrm{M}\,\mathrm{QC}\,\mathrm{NH}_{4}{}^{+}$ and $16.13\ensuremath{~\upmu\mathrm{M}~\mathrm{PO}_{4}}^{3-}$ standards were $\pm1.9\%$ an d $\pm4.4\%$ , respectively.  

Concentrations of major cations $\left(\mathbf{Na}^{+}$ , $\mathrm{K}_{~}^{+}$ , $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ , and $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ ) wer e measured using a Thermo Fisher Scientific ICS-2100 ion chromatograph equipped with an IONPAC CS12 analytical column ( $\ensuremath{^4\,\mathrm{mm\times}}$ $250\,\textrm{m m}$ ; part number 46073) with methanesulfonic acid eluent. Concentrations were determined based on calibration curves prepared with diluted solutions of IAPSO standard. Samples were diluted 1:200 with ultrapure water. IAPSO standard diluted to 1:20 0 was measured for QC after every 10 analyses. The relationship between peak area and $\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}$ concentration of the standard was linea r within the measurement range; however, peak areas of $\mathrm{K^{+}}$ , ${\mathrm{Mg}}^{2+}$ and $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ overlapped with that of $\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}.$ , and the sensitivities of thes e elements were dependent on the $\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}$ concentration of each sample. This effect was reduced by creating calibration lines of $\!\mathrm{K}^{+}$ , ${\mathrm{Mg}}^{2+}$ and $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ as a function of $\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}$ . RSDs obtained from drawing calibration lines were $0.37\%$ , $0.45\%$ , $0.32\%$ , and $0.33\%$ for $\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}$ , $\mathrm{K^{+}}$ , $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ and $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ , respectively.  

Minor elements (B, Ba, Fe, Li, Mn, Si, and Sr) were analyzed b y ICP-OES (Thermo Scientific iCAP 7600 Series). An aliquot of acidified IW sample was diluted by a factor of 10 with $0.15\;\mathrm{M}\;\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ .  A multielement stock solution was prepared from the ultrapure primary standards (SPC Science PlasmaCAL) to match the matrix o f samples and diluted by factors of 100, 50, and 25 with 0.15 M $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and $30\,\mathrm{g/L\,NaCl.}$ Finally, these working standards were diluted 1:1 0 before each sequence using the Y-containing $0.15\mathrm{~M~HNO}_{3}$ solution. A second multielement solution prepared separately from th e calibration stock solution was used for QC. The QC sample wa s measured after the analyses of each five IW samples.  

V, Cu, Zn, Ar, Mo, Rb, Cs, Pb, and U were analyzed by ICP-M S (Agilent 7500ce ICP-MS) equipped with an octopole reaction system to reduce polyatomic and double-charge interferences. To calibrate for interferences by high concentration of matrix $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ , NaCl solution was added into the standard solutions and concentration s were adjusted to those of IAPSO standard seawater. The standar d solutions were analyzed at the beginning of each run to produce calibration lines based on the average counts per second of the specifi c mass of elements. A $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ aliquot of $500\,\mathrm{ppb}$ indium standard wa s added to the empty vials before dilution. Sample aliquots were the n diluted with $1\%$ nitric acid solution to $10\%$ in these vials $(500~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ sample with $4\,\mathrm{mL}$ of $1\%\,\mathrm{HNO_{3}}$ solution and $500\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of internal standard solution) based on previously determined detection limits an d concentrations of the elements of interest. A primary standard solution matching the maximum range of predicted concentrations wa s made based on published results of deep-sea IW compositions in  a variety of settings. Composition of the primary standard solutio n was as follows: $\mathrm{V}=20$ ppb; Cs, Cu, V, As, Mo, $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{Pb}}$ , and $\mathrm{{U}=40}$ ppb; $Z\mathbf{n}=140$ ppb; and $\mathrm{Rb}=500\,\mathrm{ppb}$ . This primary standard was dilute d with the $1\%$ nitric acid solution to relative concentrations of $50\%$ $25\%$ , $10\%$ , $5\%$ , and $1\%$ . These standards were then diluted to $10\%$ with the addition of $500~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of $560\ \mathrm{mM}\,\mathrm{NaCl}$ and $3.5~\mathrm{mL}$ of the $1\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ solution to compensate matrix suppression of the plasm a ionization efficiency and $500~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ internal standard solution. Th e $25\%$ standard solution was diluted accordingly and analyzed between every eight samples throughout the series of analysis to evaluate precision and to keep consistent among the results in th e different dates of analyses. Blank solution was also analyzed ever y eight samples, and the detection limits were determined from th e standard deviation of five replicate analyses of a procedural blank o f Milli-Q water acidified with $4~\mathrm{mL}$ of optima-grade 6 M HCl. Th e average precisions of multiple determinations of the $25\%$ ICP-M S standard was $\mathrm{V}<6.4\%$ , $\mathrm{{Cu}<10\%}$ , $Z\mathrm{n}<10\%$ , $\mathrm{As}<5.4\%$ , $\mathrm{Mo}<2.0\%$ , $\mathrm{Rb}<0.71\%$ , $C s<0.31\%$ , $\mathrm{Pb}<1.8\%$ , and $\mathrm{U}<4.0\%$ .  

# Chemical analysis of solid samples Carbonate, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, and total organic carbon  

TC and TN concentrations were determined for cuttings an d cored sediments. Two types of cuttings from Holes C0002Q an d C0002R were analyzed: (1) bulk cuttings from the $1{-}4\;\mathrm{mm}$ size fraction that were gently washed by seawater (see Lithology), an d (2) intact cuttings handpicked from the $>\!4\mathrm{~mm}$ size fraction an d further washed by seawater in a sonicator. The cuttings were drie d under vacuum and ground to powder before analysis. TC and T N concentrations were determined using a Thermo Finnigan Flash elemental analysis (EA) 1112 carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur (CHNS ) analyzer. Synthetic standard sulfanilamide, which contains $41.78\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ C and $16.30\mathrm{\wt\%}\mathrm{~N}$ , was used for calibration. About $40~\mathrm{mg}$ of sediment powder was weighed, placed in a tin container, and combuste d in an oxygen stream at $900^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to liberate the carbon and nitrogen a s oxide gases from the molten sample. The combustion-produce d $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ were transported by a constant flow of carrier gas. Then, the $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ was reduced to $\mathrm{N}_{2},$ which was separated from $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ using a GC, and these gas concentrations were quantified with  a TCD. The accuracy of the analysis was determined using a soil NC S reference material (Thermo Scientific, Milan, Italy) and a sulfanilamide standard (Thermo Scientific). The range of the blank values, measured for 10 empty tin containers in the same manner as th e samples, was between 0.0004 and $0.0012\;\mathrm{mg}$ . Thus, the $3\upsigma$ of thes e values $(\sim\!0.0005\,\mathrm{mg})$ should be considered the detection limit of TC. The quantitative detection limit of TN was estimated from the erro r of the intercept of the calibration curve determined prior to ever y analytical sequence. The detection limit varied in each sequenc e and was mostly ${<}0.02\;\mathrm{mg}$ , roughly equal to $0.05\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ for the analysi s of about $40~\mathrm{mg}$ of cuttings. Because the TN concentrations of cuttings sampled during Expedition 358 were mostly close to or lowe r than the detection limit, caution is advised when interpreting concentrations less than ${\sim}0.05\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ .  

In addition to TC and TN, total sulfur (TS) was measured usin g a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA for cored samples. Approximately 2 0 mg of sediment powder was weighed into a tin cup and mixed wit h an equivalent mass of $\mathrm{V_{2}O_{5}}$ catalyst. For TS measurements, th e same calibration standard sulfanilamide $(18.65\mathrm{~wt}\%\mathrm{~S)}$ and JMS- 1 reference material was used, whereas combustion temperature wa s set at $980^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

Inorganic carbon (IC) was determined from the same set o f samples used for elemental analysis. Approximately $15{-}25\ \mathrm{mg}$ o f sediment powder was weighed and acidified with $2\,\mathrm{M}$ HCl at roo m temperature to convert carbonate to $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ . The released $C O_{2}$ was titrated, and the change in light transmittance was measured with  a photodetection cell $^{\left({\cal C}\!M5012\,{\cal C}{\cal O}_{2}\right.}$ coulometer; UIC Inc. Coulometrics). The weight percentage of carbonate was calculated from th e IC content, assuming that all the evolved $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ was derived from dissolution of calcium carbonate:  

$$
\mathrm{CaCO_{3}\left(w t\%\right)=I C\left(w t\%\right)\times100/12}.
$$  

The presence of other carbonate minerals was not accounte d for. Standard deviation of the analysis was less than $\pm0.05\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . Tw o standard materials (NIST-SRM 88b and JSD-2) were used to evaluate method accuracy. The detection limit of IC was assumed to b e $_{3\sigma}$ of the blank values of ${\sim}1\,\upmu\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{C}$ .  

TOC concentration was determined from the difference between the concentrations of TC and IC.  

# Physical properties  

Physical property measurements provide valuable constraint s on bulk sediment and rock characteristics to augment lithologi c unit characterization and to facilitate correlation of seismic reflection data with discrete core and cuttings measurements and descriptions. Thus, these data provide information necessary fo r reliable cuttings-core-log-seismic integration. Expedition $358~\mathrm{em}.$ ployed multiple approaches and methods to characterize the physical properties of cuttings and cores.  

Prior to core physical property measurements, X-ray CT image s were collected for all cores, and cores were equilibrated to roo m temperature $({\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . After temperature equilibration, whole-roun d core sections were run through the MSCL-W to measure gamm a ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, NGR, $P_{\|}$ -wave (compressional) velocity, and electrical resistivity. Afte r cores were split into archive and working halves, MAD, electrical resistivity, and $P$ -wave velocity measurements were performed o n discrete samples of cores from working halves. Thermal conductivity measurements were made on either working halves using th e TeKa thermal conductivity meter in half-space mode (mini-HLQ ) or whole-round cores using the TeKa thermal conductivity meter i n full-space mode (needle). High-resolution digital image photography was performed on archive halves using a MSCL-I. No color reflectance measurements were made during Expedition 358 becaus e the color spectroscopy logger (MSCL-C) was not functioning properly.  

For cuttings recovered from Holes C0002Q, C0002R, C0002S , and C0002T (2917.5–3257.5, 2817.5–3077.5, 2847.5–2933.5, an d 2836.5–2847.5 mbsf, respectively), limited measurements were conducted because of the size of the available material. Unwashed an d washed cuttings were analyzed for NGR employing the MSCL-W t o determine variations in the radioactive counts of the samples an d for correlation with LWD gamma ray measurements. Cuttings wer e rinsed with seawater to remove contamination from drilling mu d and sieved into ${<}1,1{-}4,$ and $>\!4\;\mathrm{mm}$ size fractions. Washed cutting s samples ${\sim}40~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ each) were taken from the 1–4 and $>\!4\ \mathrm{mm}$ siz e fractions for physical property measurements, including MAD an d magnetic susceptibility. Handpicked intact cuttings were also use d for MAD measurements to avoid the inclusion of any DICAs, pillo w cuttings, artificial cement, and drilling mud additives such as Fracseal or Barolift (see Introduction and operations). Washed cuttings of each size fraction collected every $10\;\mathrm{m}$ were also packed i n plastic liners in $3\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals to form a CCS for each hole. The CC S was then scanned by the MSCL-I to obtain high-resolution digital image photography.  

On several occasions during the expedition, large intact roc k fragments were collected from drill bits that were competen t enough for physical property measurements. In such cases, the roc k fragments (bit samples) were saw cut to produce parallel surface s and used for electrical resistivity and $P$ -wave velocity measurement s followed by MAD measurements.  

# MSCL-W  

Whole-round cores were scanned by the MSCL-W. Butyrat e core liners were used in Holes C0024B–C0024D and C0024G, whereas polycarbonate liners were used in Holes C0024E, C0024F, and C0025A. Based on repeated measurements on standard materials placed inside both types of liners, no statistically significant differences were found in the measured GRA bulk density, $P$ -wav e velocity, or resistivity values. In addition to the whole-round cores, a $12\ \mathrm{cm}$ long core liner packed with either unwashed or gentl y washed bulk cuttings was scanned using the MSCL-W NGR uni t only.  

# Gamma ray attenuation bulk density  

Bulk density can be used to evaluate pore volume, which provides information on the consolidation state. GRA bulk density i s based on the detection of a gamma ray beam directed throug h whole-round cores. The beam is produced by a $^{137}\!C s$ gamma ra y source at a radiation level of $370\;\mathrm{MBq}$ within a lead shield with a  5 mm collimator. The gamma ray detector includes a scintillator an d an integral photomultiplier tube to record the gamma rays that pas s through the whole-round core. GRA bulk density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{b}})$ is calculate d as  

$$
\mathsf{P_{b}}=(1/\upmu d)\times\ln(\mathrm{I}_{0}/I),
$$  

where  

$\mathrm{I}_{0}=$ gamma ray source intensity,   
$I=$ measured intensity of gamma rays passing through the sample,   
$\upmu=$ Compton attenuation coefficient, and   
$d=$ sample diameter.  

The Compton attenuation coefficient $(\upmu)$ and source intensit y $\left(\operatorname{I}_{0}\right)$ are treated as constants, so $\rho_{\mathrm{b}}$ can be calculated from $I.$ . The system is calibrated with a special sealed calibration “core section ” composed of a set of aligned aluminum cylinders of various diameters (e.g., $1{-}6~\mathrm{cm}]$ ) surrounded by distilled water in a sealed cor e liner. Density depends on the diameter of the aluminum cylinde r and spans from $\uprho=1$ (water only) to $2.71\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ (aluminum only). T o calibrate the instrument, gamma ray counts were taken for each aluminum cylinder for a count time of $_{60\ s}$ . The resulting $\ln(I)$ wa s plotted against the product of the known parameters $\uprho$ and $^d$ of th e calibration core section and fitted with a regression line of the following type:  

$$
\ln(I)=A(\rho\times d)^{2}+B(\rho\times d)+C,
$$  

where $^d$ is the internal diameter of the core liner (e.g., $7.3\;\mathrm{cm}$ ) an d $A,B,$ and $C$ are coefficients determined from the polynomial equation fit. Density measurements on core samples were conducte d perpendicular to the core axis every $4\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ along the core.  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

Magnetic susceptibility is the degree to which a material can b e magnetized by an external magnetic field. Therefore, magnetic susceptibility provides information on sediment mineral compositio n but is more generally used for correlation between boreholes drille d in the same formation. A Bartington loop sensor of $8\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ diamete r was used to measure magnetic susceptibility. An oscillator circuit i n the sensor produces a low-intensity $\leftrightharpoons80~\mathrm{A/m}\right$ root mean squar e [RMS]), nonsaturating alternating magnetic field $(0.565\;\mathrm{kHz})$ . Thi s pulse frequency is converted into magnetic susceptibility. The spatial resolution of the loop sensor is $23{-}27~\mathrm{mm}$ , and it is accurate t o within $5\%$ . Magnetic susceptibility data were collected every $4\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ along the core.  

# Natural gamma radiation (whole-round cores and cuttings)  

NGR measurements provide insights into sediment composition, which can be used to identify lithology. Whole-round cores a s well as washed and unwashed cuttings packed into a $400~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ cor e liner were monitored for natural gamma ray emissions to obtai n spatial variability in radioactivity and establish gamma ray dat a from cuttings for comparison with downhole gamma ray logs.  A lead-shielded counter is optically coupled to a photomultiplier tub e and connected to a bias base that supplies high-voltage power and  a signal preamplifier. Two horizontal and two vertical sensors ar e mounted in a lead, cube-shaped housing. The NGR system record s radioactive decay of long-period isotopes $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th},$ , and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ . NG R has a spatial resolution of $120{-}170\;\mathrm{mm}$ and was measured every 1 6 cm with a count time of $^{30\mathrm{~s~}}$ . The background radiation level wa s determined at the beginning of the expedition by taking measurements on core liners filled with deionized water; this backgroun d level was then subtracted from each measurement. Also, for Q C purposes during the expedition, measurements on a water-fille d liner and a standard granite core were conducted each day to chec k for fluctuations in detector sensitivity.  

For cuttings measurements, variations in packing density ma y arise that affect the measured values. Thus, the mass of the cutting s and drilling mud that was packed in the liner was determined fro m the difference between empty and filled cylinder masses. These values were used later to normalize the measured NGR values by cuttings volume to facilitate comparison with logging data and dat a from other expeditions.  

# $\pmb{P}$ -wave velocity  

$P$ -wave velocity data can be used to evaluate small-strain moduli; to correlate among log, core, and seismic data; and to evaluat e pore structure and cementation. $P$ -wave velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ is defined b y the time required for a compressional wave to travel a set distance:  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=d/t_{\mathrm{core}},
$$  

where $^d$ is the path length of the wave across the core, and $t_{\mathrm{core}}$ i s traveltime through the core.  

$P$ -wave velocity transducers on the MSCL-W system measur e total traveltime of the compressional wave between transducers. The wave travels horizontally across the whole core and core liner. The total traveltime observed is composed of the following:  

• $t_{\mathrm{delay}}=$ time delay related to transducer faces and electronic circuitry, • $t_{\mathrm{pulse}}=$ delay related to the peak detection procedure, • $t_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ transit time through the core liner, and • $t_{\mathrm{core}}=$ traveltime through the sediment or rock.  

The system is calibrated using a core liner filled with distille d water, which provides control for $t_{\mathrm{delay}},t_{\mathrm{pulse}},$ and $t_{\mathrm{liner}}$ . With these calibrations, core velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ can be calculated on whole-round specimens in core liners as follows:  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=(d_{\mathrm{cl}}-2d_{\mathrm{liner}})/(t_{0}-t_{\mathrm{pulse}}-t_{\mathrm{delay}}-2t_{\mathrm{liner}}),
$$  

where  

$d_{\mathrm{cl}}=$ measured diameter of core and liner, $d_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ liner wall thickness, and $t_{\mathrm{o}}=$ measured total traveltime.  

The calculation assumes that the core completely fills the core liner.   
$P_{\|}$ -wave velocity data were collected every $4\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ along the core.  

# Electrical resistivity  

Electrical resistivity may be useful for estimating other sedimen t physical properties, including porosity, tortuosity, permeability, an d thermal conductivity, although resistivity data must be used wit h caution because the value is sensitive to all these parameters as wel l as to the salinity of pore fluid and mineralogy. Bulk electrical resistivity is controlled by solid grain resistivity, IW resistivity, por e space distribution, and pore connectivity. The noncontact resistivity sensor on the MSCL-W system induces a high-frequency magnetic field in the core with a transmitter coil. This generates a n electrical current in the bulk sediment that is inversely proportiona l to its resistivity. The secondary magnetic field generated by this induced electrical current is measured by a receiver coil. To measur e this smaller magnetic field accurately, a differencing technique ha s been developed that compares readings from the sample core t o readings from an identical set of coils operating in air. Electrical resistivity is estimated from an empirical equation,  

$$
R=a\times E^{\mathrm{b}},
$$  

where $R$ is the electrical resistivity $(\Omega\mathrm{m})$ and $E$ is the sensor response $(\mathrm{mV})$ . The coefficients $^{a}$ and $^b$ are obtained by the calibration measurements on five reference core liners filled with differen t concentrations of $\mathtt{N a C l}$ solution (0.35, 1.75, 3.5, 17.5, and $35~\mathrm{g/L})$ ). Electrical resistivity data were obtained at $4~\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals on th e MSCL-W.  

# Magnetic susceptibility (cuttings)  

For magnetic susceptibility analysis, ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ of seawater-rinse d cuttings material was taken from vacuum-dried cuttings from th e 1–4 and $>\!4\,\textrm{m m}$ size fractions and placed into a paleomagneti c (pmag) cube. The mass of the cube was measured both empty an d then filled with the washed cuttings material. The prepared cube, with a volume of $7~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , was then analyzed with the Kappabridg e KLY 3S system (AGICO, Inc.). Sensitivity for the measurement is  3 $\times~10^{-8}~\mathrm{SI}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and intensity and frequency of the field applied are 30 0 $\mathrm{mA}/\mathrm{m}$ and $875~\mathrm{Hz}$ , respectively. A standard was measured once  a day to ensure long-term consistency of the system calibration.  A blank empty cube was measured to determine the background before each sample measurement. Using the mass of the samples an d the measured raw magnetic susceptibility (bulk susceptibility), w e calculate the mass magnetic susceptibility (MMS) by  

MMS $({\bf m}^{3}/{\bf k g})=$ (magnetic susceptibility $\times$ sample volume $[\mathfrak{m}^{3}]$ )/(sample mass [kg]).  

# Moisture and density measurements  

The purpose of MAD measurements is to determine bulk we t density, bulk dry density, grain density, water content, porosity, an d void ratio. All of these properties can be calculated using phase relations in marine sediment from the direct measurements of the we t sample mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , the dry sample mass $(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , and the dry sampl e volume $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ (Noorany, 1984). Standard ODP/IODP practices , which include a salt correction, were used to determine IW mas s and volume, salt mass and volume, and solid grain mass and volum e (Blum, 1997). Standard seawater density $(1.024\;\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ and salinit y $(35\%_{0})$ and a constant salt density $(2.22\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ were assumed for al l calculations. MAD measurements were conducted on both cutting s and cores; there is no difference in measurements and calculation s between the two sample types, only sample preparation.  

# Sample preparation  

For cores from Hole C0002T, two discrete samples $\mathrm{{}^{\sim8}\ c m^{3}}$ each) were collected from 2836.75 and 2840.64 mbsf (Sections 358- C0002T-1K-1 and 2K-1, respectively) for determination of physical properties. For cores from Sites C0024 and C0025, two discret e samples were collected per section for determination of physical properties, except when core sections were shorter than half of a full section length (full section length is approximately $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ ), in whic h case only one discrete sample was taken from a section. Some of th e samples were taken as a part of cluster samples next to WR samples. Sample intervals were chosen at minimally disturbed, homogeneous locations. Special care was taken to avoid drilling mud i n MAD samples.  

Cuttings samples were taken at $10~\mathrm{m}$ depth intervals of drillin g progress for MAD measurements. After being rinsed with seawater, the cuttings of the working portion were segregated into two siz e fractions (1–4 and ${>}4\;\mathrm{mm}$ ) by sieving. A volume of ${\sim}30\;\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ of eac h size fraction was used for MAD measurements. In addition, $\mathord{\sim}20$ $\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ of handpicked intact pieces from the $>\!4\;\mathrm{mm}$ size fraction wer e used to investigate the difference between stiffer formation cutting s and bulk cuttings that may also include DICAs, pillow cuttings, an d drilling mud additives. For Hole C0002R, intact cuttings were als o cleaned in an ultrasonic water bath for $3\,\mathrm{{min}}$ to further remove mu d contamination prior to handpicking. This process was added t o match the procedure of the structural geology group and helpe d with lithologic identification of the cuttings when necessary. Result s show that this additional procedure did not affect the measured porosity values (see Physical properties in the Site C0002 chapter [Kitajima et al., 2020]). Wet cuttings were gently wiped with absorben t paper until no visible water films were observed on the surfaces. The samples were then immediately placed into a glass jar of know n mass for wet mass measurement.  

# Measurements  

The wet sample mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ was measured using a paired electronic balance system designed to compensate for the ship’s heav e (Figure F21A). The sample mass was counterbalanced with a precisely known mass ( $\mathrm{~40~g~}$ for sediment) and determined to a precision of $\pm0.01\mathrm{~g~}$ . The balance system was calibrated twice a day o r more frequently during poor weather conditions. After measurement, the wet samples were placed in a convection oven for ${>}24\,\mathrm{h}$ a t $105^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to dry. The dry samples were then cooled in a desiccato r for at least $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ to equilibrate to room temperature $({\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and the n the dry mass and volume were measured. The dry mass $(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ wa s determined using the same counterbalanced measuring system. Dr y volume $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ was measured using a helium-displacement Quantachrome pentapycnometer (Figure F21B) with a precision of $\pm0.04\$ $\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ . The five-chamber system allows the measurement of four sample volumes and one calibration sphere, which was rotated betwee n all measurement chambers to monitor errors in each chamber. Th e pycnometer was calibrated at least once per $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . An average of fiv e measurements was reported for each sample.  

Some repeat measurements were conducted on several cutting s samples from Hole C0002Q to check if drying time and method affected the results. For intact cuttings, additional drying time beyond $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ has no effect on the results, whereas for bulk samples, porosity increased by $2\%{-}6\%$ with additional drying time. The drying time was fixed at $24\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , however, to remain consistent with previous expeditions. A vacuum chamber was also used to dry some cuttings samples to assess whether heating in the oven influenced the final porosity. Results showed that porosity values were generally consistent within $0.3\%$ between oven-dried and vacuum-dried samples.

# Phase relations in marine sediments  

From the direct measurements of $M_{\mathrm{wet}},M_{\mathrm{dry}},$ and $V_{\mathrm{dry}},$ pore fluid mass $(M_{\mathrm{f}})$ , salt mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{salt}}\right)$ , mass of solids excluding salt $(M_{s})$ , pore fluid volume $(V_{\mathrm{f}})$ , salt volume $(V_{\mathrm{salt}})$ , and volume of solids excluding salt $\left(V_{s}\right)$ can be obtained by  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{M_{\mathrm{f}}=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})/(1-s),~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}\\ {M_{\mathrm{satt}}=M_{\mathrm{f}}-(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})s/(1-s),}\\ {M_{s}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{f}}=[(M_{\mathrm{dry}}-s\times M_{\mathrm{wet}})]/(1-s),~~~~~~~}\\ {V_{\mathrm{f}}=M_{\mathrm{f}}/\rho_{\mathrm{f}}=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})/[(1-s)\rho_{\mathrm{f}}],~~~~~~~~}\end{array}
$$  

$V_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{salt}}/\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}}=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})\mathsf{s}/[(1-\mathsf{s})\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}}],$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{s}}=V_{\mathrm{dry}}-\,V_{\mathrm{salt}}=V_{\mathrm{dry}}-(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})s/[(1-\mathrm{s})\rho_{\mathrm{salt}}],
$$  

where  

$\boldsymbol{M}_{\mathrm{wet}}=$ total mass of the wet sample, $M_{\mathrm{dry}}=$ mass of the dried sample, $\scriptstyle\mathbf{s}\;=$ salinity $(3.5\%)$ , $\uprho_{\mathrm{f}}=$ density of pore fluid $(1.024\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , and $\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}}=$ density of salt $(2.220\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ .  

# Calculations of physical properties  

Water content $(W_{\mathrm{c}})$ was determined following the methods of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Designation D2216 (ASTM International, 1990). Corrections are required for salt when measuring the water content of marine samples. In addition to the water content calculation in ASTM D2216 (i.e., the ratio of pore fluid mass to dry sediment mass as percent dry weight), we also calculated the ratio of pore fluid mass to total sample mass (percent wet weight). The equations for water content are  

$W_{\mathrm{c}}\:(\%\:\mathrm{dry}\:\mathrm{weight})=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})/(M_{\mathrm{dry}}-\l\mathrm{s}M_{\mathrm{wet}})$  

$$
W_{\mathrm{c}}\left(\%\mathrm{{\wet\,weight}}\right)=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})/[M_{\mathrm{wet}}(1-{\ s})].
$$  

Bulk density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{b}}\right)$ , dry density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{d}}\right)$ , and grain density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{g}})$ are defined as  

$$
\rho_{\mathrm{b}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}/(V_{\mathrm{dry}}+V_{\mathrm{f}}-V_{\mathrm{salt}}),
$$  

$$
\uprho_{\mathrm{g}}=M_{\mathrm{s}}/V_{\mathrm{s}}=M_{\mathrm{s}}/(V_{\mathrm{dry}}-V_{\mathrm{salt}}),
$$  

where $V_{\mathrm{wet}}$ is the bulk volume of wet sample determined from the dry volume $\mathbf{\nabla}(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , pore fluid volume $(V_{\mathrm{f}})$ , and salt volume $(V_{\mathrm{salt}})$ .  

Porosity $(\Phi)$ is the ratio of the volume of pores to the total sample volume; void ratio (e) is the ratio of the pore volume to the volume of the solid grains. They are calculated as  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\Phi=V_{\mathrm{f}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}}\,\mathrm{and}}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{e=V_{\mathrm{f}}/V_{\mathrm{s}}.}}\end{array}
$$  

# $P$ -wave velocity (discrete samples)  

$P$ -wave velocity measurement was performed on discrete cubic samples $({\sim}20\ \mathrm{mm}\times20\ \mathrm{mm}\times20\ \mathrm{mm})$ ) prepared from cores and bit samples. The samples were cut with either a single or a parallel diamond blade saw, and their two parallel surfaces were ground with 220 grit sandpaper if needed. When preparation of the cubic samples was difficult, the discrete samples with parallel surfaces in one or two directions were prepared and used for $P_{\|}$ -wave and resistivity measurements. For cores, samples were cut with faces orthogonal to the $x_{\mathrm{~}},y_{\mathrm{~\rightmoon~}}$ , and $z\cdot$ -axes of the core reference (see Structural geology). This three-component measurement plan enables first-order estimation of $P$ -wave velocity anisotropy. For bit samples, the first measurement direction is recorded as the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis direction, the second as the $y$ -axis, and the third as the $z$ -axis because orientations of these bit samples were unknown.  

A $P$ -wave logger for discrete samples (PWL-D) was used to measure $P$ -wave velocity (Figure F22). The sample is held between two transducers acting as transmitter and receiver. The PWL-D stand has a laser distance sensor and two interchangeable sets of transducers with resonant frequencies at 230 and $500\,\mathrm{kHz}$ . The transmitting transducer was connected to a pulse generator, and th e receiving transducer was connected to an oscilloscope synchronized with the pulse generator. The oscilloscope signal was displayed digitally and the $P$ -wave total traveltime $(t)$ for the firs t arrival was picked and recorded. The laser distance sensor provide d the sample length $(L)$ . The velocity in any direction (e.g., $V_{\mathrm{p_{x}}})$ wa s defined by the sample length $(\mathbf{e}.\mathbf{g}.,L_{\mathrm{x}})$ , total traveltime $(t_{\mathrm{x}})$ , and system-calibrated delay time $\boldsymbol{(t_{\mathrm{delay}})}$ :  

$$
V_{\mathrm{px}}=L_{\mathrm{x}}/(t_{\mathrm{x}}-t_{\mathrm{delay}}).
$$  

Traveltime delay was determined by placing the transmitter an d receiver in direct contact and measuring the traveltime. The lase r distance sensor was calibrated by placing the transmitter and receiver in direct contact and then spacing them using a $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ lon g reference specimen. QC measurements were made daily by measuring velocity on acrylic and glass standards with known lengths an d acoustic velocity values.  

Measurements on discrete core samples were performed wit h the $500\;\mathrm{kHz}$ transducers, whereas those on bit samples from Hole s  

![](images/92180ae69fd3a6b30fa7c627050c2316e73e373f421e111d3a51cb02207588dd.jpg)

C0002Q and C0002R were performed with both the 230 and 50 0 kHz transducers. Waveforms from heterogeneous or attenuatin g samples, as well as some samples with irregular shapes, exhibite d significant distortion of the wave train. Because the automated pic k was on the second zero crossing (rather than on the first arrival), these measurements were discarded as unreliable.  

Because $P$ -wave velocity was measured in the $x_{\mathrm{~\}},y_{\mathrm{~\$ , and $z$ -directions for cores from Sites C0024 and C0025, the anisotropy was calculated following the approach of Carlson and Christensen (1977). Some sources of anisotropy include (1) alignment of pores durin g consolidation, (2) fabric development due to alignment of mineral grains, and (3) microstructures such as microfractures and microcracks. Calculation of the horizontal-plane anisotropy $\left(\alpha_{\mathrm{VPhor}}\right)$ an d vertical-plane anisotropy $\left(\alpha_{\mathrm{VPvert}}\right)$ of $P.$ -wave velocity compares th e horizontal $\scriptstyle{\left[x\right]}$ and $y_{.}$ ) and vertical $(z)$ components of $P$ -wave velocit y expressed as a percentage of the mean:  

$$
\alpha_{\mathrm{VPvert}}\,(\%)=200[(V_{\mathrm{px}}+V_{\mathrm{py}})/2-V_{\mathrm{pz}}]/[(V_{\mathrm{px}}+V_{\mathrm{py}})/2+V_{\mathrm{pz}}].
$$  

# Electrical resistivity (discrete samples)  

Resistivity was measured on the same discrete samples used fo r $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity measurements for relatively consolidated materials. The parallel faces of the samples were held between two electrodes, and their complex impedance was measured with a $40~\mathrm{Hz}$ to 11 0 MHz frequency sweep with the Agilent 4294A impedance analyze r (Figure F23). Sample dimensions were obtained during $P$ -wave velocity measurement. Coupling between the sample and each stainless steel electrode was obtained through a paper filter soaked i n either $35\,\mathrm{g/L}\,\mathrm{NaCl}$ solution or seawater. The impedance of the sample for each configuration was obtained by subtracting the impedance of the coupling layers from the measured impedance. Th e impedance of the coupling layers was evaluated by stacking the tw o filters between the electrodes immediately after measuring the impedance of the sample. Sample resistivity $\left(R_{\mathrm{x}}\right)$ in the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -direction wa s computed from the amplitude $(|Z_{\mathrm{x}}|)$ and phase angle $(\Theta_{\mathrm{x}})$ of th e measured impedance by  

$$
R_{\mathrm{x}}=[|Z_{\mathrm{x}}|\mathrm{cos}(\Theta_{\mathrm{x}})-|Z_{0}|\mathrm{cos}(\Theta_{0})]\times(L_{\mathrm{y}}L_{\mathrm{z}}/L_{\mathrm{x}}),
$$  

![](images/195738f55217dd66d5634f557574fa101653874c79eed75619b0c1a4ad37a18a.jpg)  

where $L_{\mathrm{x}},L_{\mathrm{y}},$ and $L_{\mathrm{z}}$ are the lengths of cubic discrete samples in th e $x_{\mathrm{~\,~}},y_{\mathrm{~\,~}}$ , and $z$ -direction, respectively, and $\left|Z_{0}\right|$ and $\uptheta_{0}$ refer to the amplitude and phase angle of the filter impedance. Resistivities in th e $y_{-}$ and $z$ -directions were obtained similarly.  

In the case of discrete core samples and bit samples from Sit e C0002, $L_{\mathrm{y}}$ and $L_{\mathrm{z}}$ are not known precisely because the shapes of th e discrete samples were generally irregular. In such cases, the pycnometer was used to measure the wet rock volume so that the effective cross-sectional area (equivalent to $L_{\mathrm{y}}\times L_{\mathrm{z}})$ could be estimate d by dividing the volume by the thickness $\left({L_{\mathrm{x}}}\right)$ .  

Resistivity is calculated as the inverse of the real conductivity. T o minimize electrode polarization effects on conductance and to remain consistent with Expedition 348 data and reports, the values o f conductivity and resistivity at $10\,\mathrm{kHz}$ were reported. The laborator y temperature was also reported for each measurement to allow correction to in situ temperature and for comparison with logging data. Similar to the $P$ -wave velocity anisotropy, when oriented cubic samples were available from Site C0024 cores, the horizontal-plan e anisotropy $\left(\alpha_{\mathrm{Rhor}}\right)$ and vertical-plane anisotropy $(\alpha_{\mathrm{Rvert}})$ of electrica l resistivity were calculated by comparing the horizontal $\scriptstyle{\left(x\right)}$ and $y$ ) and vertical $(z)$ components of resistivity expressed as a percentag e of the mean:  

$\upalpha_{\mathrm{Rhor}}\,(\%)=200[(R_{\mathrm{x}}-R_{\mathrm{y}})/(R_{\mathrm{x}}+R_{\mathrm{y}})]$  

$$
\alpha_{\mathrm{Rvert}}\,(\%)=200[(R_{\mathrm{x}}+R_{\mathrm{y}})/2-R_{\mathrm{z}}]/[(R_{\mathrm{x}}+R_{\mathrm{y}})/2+R_{\mathrm{z}}].
$$  

For soft-sediment cores, the complex impedance (i.e., equivalen t resistivity) was measured using the Agilent 4294A analyzer and  a four-pin array consisting of four electrodes spaced $7.5~\mathrm{mm}$ apart. The array was inserted into the working half and measured th e complex impedance, from which the electrical resistivity in the $y_{\mathrm{~\,~}}$ - direction was calculated:  

$$
R_{\mathrm{y}}=|Z_{\mathrm{y}}|\mathrm{cos}\theta_{\mathrm{y}}/d_{\mathrm{r}},
$$  

where $d_{\mathrm{r}}$ is a constant dependent on the geometry of the electrod e array and $Z$ and θ are the magnitude and phase, respectively, of th e complex impedance. $d_{\mathrm{r}}$ was determined every $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ by comparin g the measured impedance with an IAPSO standard seawater solution $(35\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{L}\;\mathrm{NaCl})$ of known electrical impedance.  

# Thermal conductivity  

In an infinite homogeneous media, a line heat source with  a constant heat power will cause a temperature increase after initiation of heating as expressed by  

$$
T(t)=(q/4\uppi k)\times\ln(t)+\mathrm{C},
$$  

where  

$T(t)=$ temperature as a function of time, $q=$ constant line heat input per unit length per unit time, $k=$ thermal conductivity, $t=$ time after the start of heating, and $C=\mathbf{a}$ constant depending on thermal diffusivity, etc.  

By applying a known heat power $q$ for a certain time interval, th e value of $k$ can be determined through a least-squares fitting of th e temperature versus time record.  

Thermal conductivity was measured on core working halves at  a spacing of at least 1 measurement per core using a half-space lin e source probe (mini-HLQ probe) (Vacquier, 1985), which approximates an infinite line source, for consolidated cores from Hole s C0002T, C0024E, C0024F, and C0025A. Samples were placed in  a seawater bath at ambient temperature $(20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ for at least 15 min before measurement. The half-space probe was placed directly on th e split core parallel to the core axis. For soft-sediment cores fro m Holes C0024B, C0024D, C0024G, and C0025A, a full-space needl e probe was inserted into whole-round sections through a hole drille d through the working-half side of the core liner.  

Using the TK04 (TeKa Berlin) thermal conductivity measurement system (Blum, 1997), all thermal conductivity measurement s were made after cores equilibrated to room temperature. At the beginning of each measurement, temperature in the sample was monitored to ensure that thermal drift was ${<}0.4\,\mathrm{~mK/min}$ (typicall y within $1{-}2\ \mathrm{min}$ ). After it was established that the temperature wa s near equilibrium, a calibrated heat source was applied, and the ris e in temperature was recorded for ${\sim}60~\mathrm{s}$ . For optimal measuremen t conditions, the heat source power was adjusted as a function of th e thermal conductivity of the sample. Thermal conductivity value s were based on the observed rise in temperature for a given quantit y of heat. The probe was calibrated at least once every $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . The calibration was performed on standard Macor blocks of known thermal conductivity, which is $1.652~\mathrm{W/(m\cdotK)}\,\pm\,2\%$ for a half-space lin e source probe and $1.623\,\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})\pm2\%$ for a full-space needle probe. The TK04 software fitted a theoretical prediction of the temperature rise versus time curve to various segments of the data (typicall y segments within 20–80 s since start time of heating) yielding multiple estimates of the thermal conductivity. Each estimation was evaluated according to an index logarithm of extreme time (LET) tha t helps to evaluate at what point the boundary conditions assumed i n the theoretical prediction appear to become invalid. We disregarded any conductivity estimates derived from those with LET values ${<}4$ for a half-space probe or ${<}3$ for a full-space needle probe. Also, the conductivity estimate associated with the greatest LE T was taken as the best estimate (as suggested by the manufacturer). Measurements were repeated 5 times automatically by the TK0 4 system, and the average value of the conductivity estimates were reported.  

# Shear strength measurements  

The shear strength of soft-sediment core working halves at Sit e C0024 was measured with an analog vane shear (Wykeham Farrance WF23544) and a pocket penetrometer (Geotest E-284B). On e measurement per core was taken, avoiding disturbed and heterogeneous sections. The shear strength of cores from Site C0025 wa s measured using only the pocket penetrometer. At least one but occasionally two measurements were made per section for Site C0025. Measurements were made with the vane rotation axis and the penetrometer penetration direction aligned with the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis of the core.  

Undrained shear stress $(S_{\mathrm{u[vane]}})$ is determined by the torque $(T)$ at failure and a constant $(K_{\mathrm{v}})$ dependent on the geometry of th e vane:  

$$
S_{\mathrm{u[vane]}}=T/K_{\mathrm{v}}.
$$  

All measurements were made with a $12.7~\mathrm{mm}$ long vane and  a $6.35\ \mathrm{mm}$ wide blade. Pocket penetrometer measurements provid e  

an estimate of unconfined compressive strength $(q_{\mathrm{u}})$ , which is related to the undrained shear stress $S_{\mathrm{u[penetrometer]}})$ by  

# $S_{\mathrm{u[penetrometer]}}=g(q_{\mathrm{u}})/2,$  

where $g=$ gravitational acceleration. Penetrometer measurement s were conducted by pushing a $6.5\ \mathrm{mm}$ diameter cylindrical prob e into the working half and recording the penetration resistance. Shear strength was reported as undrained shear strength to allo w comparison between different methods.  

# Anelastic strain recovery analysis  

ASR is a core-based measurement technique that can evaluat e both orientation and magnitude of 3-D present-day principa l stresses, with several assumptions. The ASR approach is to measur e the anelastic strain change due to release of the stress soon afte r core recovery. The methodology used for the ASR measuremen t during Expedition 358 is based on Matsuki (1991), following th e guideline described in Lin et al. (2007). A $15~\mathrm{cm}$ long undisturbe d whole-round core was selected and sampled directly from the cor e in the core cutting area and then X-ray CT scanning was carried ou t to screen for potential important structural sections. We did no t perform MSCL-W measurements on these samples because th e ASR measurement is time sensitive and requires instrumentation a s soon as possible after core is extracted from the subsurface to capture early strain recovery. Core samples were pushed out of thei r core liners, and the outer surface was washed in seawater to remov e drilling mud.  

Before starting the ASR measurement, the dimensions of an elliptical section of core sample were measured by a 2-D measurement sensor (Keyence Corporation; TM-065) while rotating th e core samples on the rotary table (Figure F24). This measuremen t was carried out to capture initial elastic strain recovery.  

The anelastic strains in nine directions, including six independent directions, were measured using 18-wire strain gauges ( 6 cross- and 6 single gauges; $120\,\Omega;$ Figure F25). In cases where a fe w fractures had developed in the specimen, the fractures were glue d to prevent the sample from splitting into pieces. It took $1\mathrm{-}2~\mathrm{h}$ t o mount 18 strain gauges, and the total elapsed time just after core o n deck was $1\mathrm{-}2~\mathrm{h}$ before starting to record the strain recovery. Th e core samples were double-bagged (with plastic and aluminum) an d submerged in a thermostatic water bath where temperature change s

were kept controlled at $22^{\circ}\pm0.1^{\circ}C$ for the duration of the measurement. Strain values were collected every $10\;\mathrm{min}$ for a maximum o f 15 days.  

# MSCL-I: photo image logger  

Digital images of archive-half cores and CCSs were acquired b y a linescan camera equipped with three charge-coupled devices. Each charge-coupled device has 2048 arrays. The reflected ligh t from the core surface is split into three channels (red, green, an d blue [RGB]) by a beam splitter inside the linescan camera and detected by the corresponding charge-coupled device. The signal s were combined, and the digital image was reconstructed. A correction was made for any minor mechanical differences among th e charge-coupled device responses. A calibration was conducted before scanning each core to compensate for pixel-to-pixel respons e variation, uneven lighting, and lens effects. After colors of blac k $\left(\mathrm{RGB}=0\right)$ ) and white $^\mathrm{RGB}=255_{.}$ ) were calibrated at f-stop $=\mathrm{\Deltaf}/16_{:}$ , the light was adjusted to have an adequate grayscale of $\mathrm{RGB}=137$ a t $\mathrm{f-stop}=\mathrm{f}/11$ . Optical distortion was avoided by precise movemen t of the camera. Spatial resolution is 100 pixels/cm.

# Downhole measurements  

In situ temperature measurements  

In situ temperature measurements were carried out at Sit e C0024 using the advanced piston corer temperature (APCT-3) too l (Heesemann, et al., 2006), which is installed in the HPCS assembl y to measure in situ formation temperatures. The APCT-3 shoe consists of the electronics and the coring hardware. During this expedition, an in situ temperature measurement was performed every tw o cores during HPCS coring. The sensor was calibrated for a workin g range of $0^{\circ}{-}45^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Prior to entering the hole, the instrument wa s held at the mudline for $5{-}10\ \mathrm{min}$ to equilibrate with bottom wate r temperature. The coring barrel was then lowered down the hole an d penetrated the formation as part of the coring assembly. It was the n left in position for at least $10\;\mathrm{min}$ to record temperature after penetration. The penetration of the tool into the formation causes a ris e in temperature due to frictional heating. Following the initial rise i n temperature, temperature decreases with time along a decay curv e toward an equilibrium value. A second rise in temperature fro m frictional heating can also be seen when the tool is pulled out of th e formation. Temperature was measured as a time series sampled every 1 s and logged on a microprocessor in the downhole tool; whe n the tool was retrieved, data were downloaded for processing. Th e formation equilibrium temperature is determined based on regression of a theoretical temperature decay curve to the data using th e MATLAB script TP-Fit.  

# Logging  

LWD and measurement-while-drilling (MWD) tools measure i n situ physical properties and downhole drilling parameters that ca n be analyzed both in real time using mud-pulse telemetry and afte r recovering the BHA and downloading the memory data. For Expedition 358, LWD/MWD acquisition was performed under contrac t by Schlumberger Drilling and Measurements Services.  

Because LWD/MWD data are recorded soon after initial drilling, depending on the BHA configuration and drilling rate of penetration (ROP), these measurements are less affected by drilling mu d formation invasion and disturbance when compared to wireline logging. LWD/MWD tools used during Expedition 358 include d  

Schlumberger’s arcVISION, TeleScope, MicroScope, SonicScope, and seismicVISION. The types of data recorded include NGR, downhole WOB and torque, annular pressure and mud temperature, resistivity, azimuthal resistivity images, compressional an d shear wave sonic velocities, and vertical seismic traveltime data. Although the original plan was to acquire a full suite of measurement s over each section, depending on borehole diameter and tool availability, the actual tools and BHA configurations used in each sectio n were eventually dictated by hole conditions and operational circumstances.  

# LWD acquisition systems and tools  

The LWD/MWD assembly includes a memory module and use s batteries and a mud turbine for power. Real-time monitoring of dat a acquired downhole while drilling is possible by transmission fro m the tool string to the ship using a modulated pressure wave in th e drilling mud (mud-pulse telemetry). Only a subset of LWD/MW D data was sent because of the bandwidth limitations of mud pulsing. Based on the relevance for drilling parameters and formation characterization, specific channels were chosen for real-time transmission. MWD data on drilling parameters such as drilling speed, ROP, and stick-slip indicators were transmitted (for some but not all BH A configurations) together with subsampled geophysical logs for hazard monitoring, formation information, and log quality check s during the acquisition. Full-resolution logs from each tool’s memor y chips only became available after the BHA was recovered on dec k and data were downloaded.  

Data processing included environmental corrections to ra w data, image construction in depth, and waveform analysis, as detailed below. Depth values reported in the processed logs are corrected to true sensor location rather than bit depth. The individua l tools that were used during Expedition 358 are described below. Al l tool specifications, names, and acronyms of the recorded logs ar e listed in Tables T9 and T10. Figure F26 shows the different LW D tool BHAs used during Expedition 358. Additional BHAs include d only an MWD tool to record deviation surveys. A more complet e description of the tools is available from Schlumberger Loggin g While Drilling Services (https://www.slb.com/drilling/surfaceand-downhole-logging/logging-while-drilling-services).  

# arcVISION  

Schlumberger’s arcVISION tool measures gamma ray, propagation resistivity, and pressure and temperature in the borehole annulus. Annular pressure data were used to calculate the equivalen t circulating density, which is the apparent density of the drilling flui d during pumping. Downhole pressure is also crucial for detectin g any inflow from the formation into the borehole or obstruction o f the borehole due to collapse of the borehole walls, signaled by a n increase in pressure. Monitoring of downhole pressure also allow s us to detect pressure decreases associated with loss of circulatio n due to permeable formations, faults, or unintended hydraulic fractures.  

The arcVISION tool measures natural gamma ray and propagation resistivity. For propagation resistivity, phase shift and attenuation are measured using five transmitters and two receivers at tw o frequencies ( ${}^{400}\,\mathrm{kHz}$ and $2\operatorname{MHz}$ . In total, 20 resistivity curves ar e acquired at different depths of investigation and axial resolutions. The depth of investigation ranges from 13 to 38 inches, and the axial resolution ranges from 0.7 to 3.0 inches (all resolutions and depth s of investigation are detailed in Table T11). These resistivity data a t various depths of penetration enable an estimation of the borehol e size (electromagnetic caliper [e-caliper]) that Schlumberger ca n compute on demand using internal software. The e-caliper can als o be processed shipboard by scientists using a nondocumented proprietary module from Schlumberger’s Techlog software platform.  

Processing of the gamma ray log includes corrections for fou r environmental factors: bit size, collar thickness, mud weight, an d potassium content in the drilling mud. If the borehole is enlarge d compared to the bit size, the processed gamma ray log values will b e underestimated. If the mud has higher potassium content, the processed gamma ray values will be overestimated. The data are processed on site by Schlumberger prior to data delivery.  

# seismicVISION  

The seismicVISION tool produces data that can be interprete d to be a check shot survey, providing a traveltime–depth function fo r seismic/well calibration, interval velocity, and a vertical seismic profile. The seismicVISION tool records seismograms using a hydrophone and a three-component geophone in the tool and a surfac e source and hydrophone. The source used during Expedition 358 i n Hole C0024A consisted of an array of three $250\ \mathrm{inch^{3}}$ air guns an d three $150\;\mathrm{inch^{3}}$ air guns (a total of $1200\;\mathrm{inch}^{3})$ ) that were suspende d by crane ${\sim}57\mathrm{~m~}$ from the rotary table (Figure F27) and fired fro m $5.4~\mathrm{m}$ below sea level (mbsl) at 2500 psi. Time correlations of th e shots are ensured using high-precision clocks at both the surfac e and downhole hydrophones. The surface hydrophone was suspended $1.27\textrm{m}$ below the air guns (total of $6.67~\mathrm{m}$ below mean se a level) and the zero times of the waveforms were corrected to mea n sea level. seismicVISION data were acquired while the pipe was being recovered. The first data were acquired at 752 mbsf, and the res t of the data were acquired every ${\sim}19\mathrm{~m~}$ at the connection and th e middle of each standpipe above 575 mbsf.  

At each data acquisition level, 10 shots were fired by the surfac e source at $15\;\mathrm{s}$ intervals. The tool records the pressure (hydrophone ) and acceleration (three-component geophones) seismograms obtained for each shot and calculates and records a vertical stack o f the shots. In practice, because our holes were near vertical and th e tool was centered and unclamped, the geophone data yielded littl e useful information. The tool also automatically picks and record s the $P$ -wave arrival time in the stacked seismogram. The stacke d seismogram and the picked $P$ -wave arrival times from the instrument are transmitted to the ship by the MWD system and thu s could be used soon after acquisition at each level or as the primar y data in case the tool fails to record or loses data.

# MicroScope  

Schlumberger’s MicroScope tool provides measurements of laterolog-type formation resistivity and high-resolution electrical resistivity images of the borehole wall. The tool provides severa l resistivity measurements: button resistivity at various depths of investigation (shallow, medium, deep, and extradeep), toroid (ring) resistivity, and bit resistivity.  

Bit resistivity uses the lower portion of the tool and the bit as  a measuring electrode. The lower transmitter coil generates a curren t that flows through the bit and into the formation, returning to th e drill collar farther up the tool string. By measuring the axial curren t through the bit for a given voltage, resistivity near the bit is determined by Ohm’s law. The axial resolution is 48 inches.  

For the toroid/ring resistivity, upper and lower transmitter toroids produce currents that flow out of the tool approximately perpendicular  to  the  formation  and  provide  lateral  resistivit y measurements at two depths of investigation (5 and 6 inches) an d an axial resolution of 15 inches.  

Button resistivity is similar to toroid resistivity except that electrodes are used instead of toroids. Four button electrodes, each 0. 4 inches in diameter, measure resistivity at four depths of investigation into the borehole wall: $\sim\!1.5,\,3,\,5;$ , and 6 inches. The tool acquires  azimuthal  readings  as  it  rotates  and  determines  it s orientation referenced to Earth’s magnetic field using accelerometers and magnetometers. After downloading the tool memory data,

the service company generated $360^{\circ}$ images of the borehole wall, sampled azimuthally at ${\sim}6.4^{\circ}$ (56 “bins”) and sampled vertically a t 0.3 inches (vertical resolution of 0.6 inches).  

A two-button electrode design ensures better borehole wall coverage and provides ultrahigh-resolution images, sampled azimuthally at ${\sim}1.7^{\circ}$ (208 bins) and sampled vertically at 0.2 inches (vertica l resolution of 0.4 inches).  

# SonicScope  

Schlumberger’s SonicScope tool acquires both monopole an d quadrupole waveforms using a single transmitter that excites bot h modes over a frequency range from 1 to $20\,\mathrm{kHz}$ . Transmitted soni c waves are detected by four arrays of azimuthal receivers; each arra y has 12 receivers. The received waveforms are stored in the too l memory, and the tool also automatically picks arrival times, generating an estimate of the slowness ( $\Delta t;$ traveltime over distance, o r the reciprocal of velocity) for waves transmitted through the formation, and those picks are transmitted uphole for real-time slownes s logs. Later processing of the full waveforms, stored in the memor y data, is used to generate the final sonic logs.  

In monopole mode, the transmitter generates a compressiona l wave that refracts at the borehole wall, generating critically refracted compressional and shear waves that travel along the borehole wall. The shear waves are only observed if the formation’s shea r slowness is less than the slowness of the borehole fluid (i.e., in a fas t formation). If the formation shear slowness is greater than the flui d slowness (i.e., in a slow formation), the shear wave is refracted awa y from the borehole and no shear wave returns to the tool. Quadrupole sources generate waves that are highly dispersive (velocity i s frequency dependent), but which at the lower end of the frequenc y

# TeleScope  

Schlumberger’s TeleScope MWD tool measures downhole WO B and torque, provides direction and inclination measurements, an d transfers drilling data and select formation data to the ship in rea l time  using  mud-pulse  telemetry  (https://www.slb.com/-/media/files/drilling/brochure/telescope-br). The TeleScope provide s critical real-time two-way communication between LWD tools an d the surface. This communication enables both scientists and operators to monitor drilling operations, estimate borehole conditions, an d detect geologic features while drilling. The mud-pulse telemetry process utilizes a modulator to generate a continuous $12~\mathrm{Hz}$ pressur e wave in the drilling fluid and changes the phase of the signal (continuous phase modulation) to transmit the data to the surface. Th e transmission rate ranges from 0.5 to 12 bps and is primarily dependent on water depth and fluid density. A pulse rate of 6 bps was use d during Expedition 358. Various models of the TeleScope 675 wer e used during this expedition, and the main difference between the m was the ability or lack thereof to measure downhole WOB.  

During Expedition 358, various combinations of data from th e TeleScope, arcVISION, MicroScope, and SonicScope were transferred to the ship in real time, depending on which tools were in th e drill string BHA for a given run (Figure F26). Because of the limite d bandwidth of mud-pulse telemetry, those data were downsample d for real-time transfer.  

# Onboard data flow  

The LWD tools recorded data at a preset frequency based o n logging speed and the tool-optimized resolution, providing measurements as a function of time. The depth information for th e LWD and MWD data was recorded on the LSF depth scale) but reported as depth below seafloor (mbsf) for reporting purposes to allow standard interpretation and correlation with shipboard sampl e measurements. Schlumberger’s integrated logging and drilling surface system, which was installed on Chikyu, was used to record an d control the ROP and depth of the drill string at any given time whil e logging. This was determined using the length of the drill string an d derrick top drive position. A crown-mounted heave compensator a t the top of the derrick helped reduce errors from heave and improved WOB accuracy.  

The real-time data were displayed on a monitor in the laboratory in real time and uploaded to the server every $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ for an initia l interpretation by shipboard scientists. Recovery of the memory dat a occurred after each BHA run. In both cases, data referenced in tim e were converted to BRT depth. The depth reference was then converted to the LSF depth scale. Data were then distributed in digita l log information standard (DLIS) format, and the main scalar log s were extracted and converted into log ASCII standard (LAS) files.  

# Data quality assessment  

Cross-correlating LWD/MWD data for primary quality assessment included the use of downhole drilling parameters, drillin g control logs, and geophysical control logs. The Logging Staff Scientists (LSSs) documented the LWD/MWD operations and converte d the raw data received from the Schlumberger engineer to the LS F depth scale. Resistivity and e-caliper logs were used for data qualit y assessment, permitting analysis of borehole conditions (e.g., caving, washout, bridges, and invasion) for potential effects on loggin g data. Borehole images were also used to assess borehole conditions. Regions of high stick-slip also affect image quality. Time elapsed after passage of the drill bit for the main geophysical measurement s was also monitored as a quality check along with drilling operations. Because of variations in sampling time, all measurements ma y have insufficient heave compensation and/or unaccounted movements, including bending, shocks, and vibrations of the BHA, creating errors in local depth measurements as much as tens o f centimeters.  

# Real-time quality control and real-time geomechanics  

Logging scientists and the LSSs continuously observed the realtime data feed and closed-circuit television feed from the rig floor. This provided an initial quality check on the data and tracking o f events (e.g., time off bottom) that could affect the log response. Th e parameters monitored included sonic logs, resistivity, gamma ray, annular pressures, torque, WOB, ROP, and mud volume.  

When electric images were recorded, logging scientists provided rapid interpretation of structures and borehole breakouts using the real-time resistivity image data as part of the real-tim e geomechanics (RTG) workflow. Screenshots of the real-time dat a were printed out every $^{3\,\mathrm{h}}$ , and manual picking of structures (bedding, resistive fractures, conductive fractures, borehole breakouts, and tensile fractures) was performed. PDFs of the real-time imag e data were uploaded to the server every $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ and were used to doubl e check the initial interpretations. Picked structures and their orientations were reported to the Science Leaders and RTG watch leads, who then used these data as part of a larger data set to examin e borehole stability and downhole stress and provide recommendations for mud weight. Daily geomechanics reports are available i n RTG in Supplementary material.  

# Log and image interpretation  

Changes in the log response are usually related to variation o f the composition and/or texture of sediment and rock, and they wer e used to define and characterize formation properties. Logging unit s were characterized through both qualitative and quantitative methods.  

# Lithologic logging unit characterization  

The depths of logging unit boundaries, physical properties o f the logging units, and bedding information were defined based o n LWD logs and borehole images. Trends and variations in all available LWD/MWD logs were examined to define distinct loggin g units and allowed for the following:  

• Defining and characterizing each logging unit, subunit, and unit boundary; • Categorizing composition and trends in each unit; and • Interpreting geological features based on log data.  

Lithology, from unit scale to bed scale, was primarily determined from gamma ray logs along with resistivity and sonic log s when available. High or low gamma radiation was used as the primary indicator for the interpretation of clay- or sand-rich intervals, respectively. Sonic and resistivity logs aided textural interpretation. Borehole images helped in characterizing geological features suc h as bedding orientation, faults, fractures, sedimentary structures, bed boundaries, and unconformities. Logging units were correlate d with core, cuttings, and seismic data at Site C0002 from previou s Integrated Ocean Drilling Program expeditions (Expedition 31 4 Scientists, 2009; Expedition 315 Scientists, 2009b; Strasser et al., 2014b; Tobin et al., 2015b) to further refine the interpretations (se e Lithology).  

# Structural interpretation from logs  

Structural analysis was performed on the memory data resistivity image logs using Schlumberger’s Techlog software. The azimuthal button resistivity data were displayed as unwrapped $360^{\circ}$ north-oriented images of the borehole wall for interpretation an d dip measurements. As part of the workflow for image analysis, dynamic and static normalization were performed on the resistivit y images. Static normalization shows overall change in resistivity in  a single borehole or a logging run because it displays a color scal e covering the entire range of resistivity throughout the run. Dynami c normalization recalculates the color scale range over a “sliding ” depth interval and is thus useful for bringing out subtle details in  a log such as changes in facies or lithology, natural and drilling-induced fracture, or borehole breakout width.  

Resistivity contrasts in the rock are the basis for the identification and interpretation of geological features in the resistivity images. Dipping planar surfaces are identified as sinusoidal curves o f similar contrast in unwrapped resistivity images (Luthi, 2001). Th e dip and azimuth of fractures, faults, and bedding were determine d by fitting sinusoids to the image data. Artifacts can appear in th e processed data because of stick-slip and insufficient heave corrections (Lofts and Bourke, 1999). Borehole diameter was obtaine d from the e-caliper. The borehole size was set to the bit size $(8\%$ inches for all runs, except $12\%$ inches for the lowermost section o f Hole C0002R) to calculate dip when a caliper measurement wa s missing. This assumption may cause dip to be overestimated in regions with a large borehole diameter, introducing small dip angle errors. This means the reported dips should be viewed as maximu m values. Depth of resistivity investigation was also one of the parameters used for dip angle calculation.  

Using the background resistivity as a base, we classified fractures as conductive or resistive but only for unambiguous examples. Clear crosscutting or dramatic variation in bedding dip formed th e basis for fracture classification in addition to azimuth orientatio n and fracture density.  

# Borehole wall analysis  

Stress orientation in the borehole can be determined by usin g both borehole breakouts and drilling-induced tensile fracture s (DITFs). The vertical stress $(S_{\mathrm{v}})$ , two horizontal principal stresse s $\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{S}}_{\mathrm{hmin}}$ and $S_{\mathrm{HMAX}})$ ), fluid pressures, and mud weight are considered t o control the circumferential stress azimuth around the borehol e (Jaeger and Cook, 1979; Zoback, 2007). Borehole breakouts for m when the maximum circumferential stress exceeds the unconfine d compressive strength of the formation, assuming an isotropic formation. In a vertical well, breakouts appear in resistivity images (obtained with the MicroScope tool) as parallel and vertical conductiv e features oriented $180^{\circ}$ apart from each other in the direction o f $S_{\mathrm{hmin}}$ . The minimum circumferential stress arises in the direction o f $S_{\mathrm{HMAX}}$ where DITFs form if the effective circumferential stress becomes negative (tensional) enough to overcome the tensile strengt h of the formation (typically less than $10\,\mathrm{MPa}_{\mathrm{}}$ ). DITFs appear as vertical pairs of cracks $180^{\circ}$ apart if the borehole axis is aligned with th e vertical stress but could form en echelon patterns of inclined crack s if the borehole axis is deviated from vertical (Zoback, 2007).  

Interpretation of the various resistivity images provided the orientation of breakouts and DITFs. Resistivity images were oriente d to convert the measured azimuths and widths of breakouts alon g with DITFs into true azimuth for the estimation of horizontal principal stress direction.  

Integration with lithologic interpretations helped interpret variations in the formation strength, stress, and/or pore pressure. MWD drilling parameters assisted in the analysis of borehole stability, mud pressure surges, and formation strength.  

# Estimation of porosity from resistivity  

In the absence of an LWD tool to directly measure in situ porosity, we used Archie’s law to derive a porosity $(\Phi)$ log from the measured resistivity log:  

$$
F=a/\Phi^{\mathrm{m}},
$$  

where $F$ is the formation factor, and $^{a}$ and $_m$ are known as the tortuosity and cementation factor, respectively. The formation factor i s calculated from the resistivity log as  

$$
F=R/R_{\mathrm{f}},
$$  

where $R$ is the LWD-measured resistivity and $R_{\mathrm{f}}$ is the resistivity o f the pore fluid. We used the deep resistivity measurement to minimize the effects of fluid invasion into the formation. The fluid resistivity  can  be  estimated  from  assumptions  on  the  pressure, temperature, and salinity of the pore fluid. The cementation facto r depends on rock type and was calibrated using the shipboard measurements of porosity and resistivity on cuttings and core samples.
