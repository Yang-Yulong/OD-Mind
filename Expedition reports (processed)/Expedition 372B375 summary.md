# Abstract  

Slow slip events (SSEs) at the northern Hikurangi subductio n margin, New Zealand, are among the best-documented shallo w SSEs on Earth. International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition s 372 and 375 were undertaken to investigate the processes and i n situ conditions that underlie subduction zone SSEs at the norther n Hikurangi Trough. We accomplished this goal by (1) coring an d geophysical logging at four sites, including penetration of an activ e thrust fault (the Pāpaku fault) near the deformation front, the uppe r plate above the SSE source region, and the incoming sedimentar y succession in the Hikurangi Trough and atop the Tūranganui Knol l seamount; and (2) installing borehole observatories in the Pāpak u fault and in the upper plate overlying the slow slip source region. Logging-while-drilling (LWD) data for this project were acquired a s part of Expedition 372, and coring, wireline logging, and observatory installations were conducted during Expedition 375.  

Northern Hikurangi subduction margin SSEs recur every $1{-}2\ \mathrm{y}$ and thus provide an ideal opportunity to monitor deformation an d associated changes in chemical and physical properties throughou t the slow slip cycle. In situ measurements and sampling of materia l from the sedimentary section and oceanic basement of the subducting plate reveal the rock properties, composition, lithology, an d structural character of material that is transported downdip into th e SSE source region. A recent seafloor geodetic experiment raises th e possibility that SSEs at northern Hikurangi may propagate to th e trench, indicating that the shallow thrust fault (the Pāpaku fault ) targeted during Expeditions 372 and 375 may also lie in the SS E rupture area and host a portion of the slip in these events. Hence, sampling and logging at this location provides insights into th e composition, physical properties, and architecture of a shallow faul t that may host slow slip.  

Expeditions 372 and 375 were designed to address three fundamental scientific objectives:  

1. Characterize the state and composition of the incoming plate and shallow fault near the trench, which comprise the protolith and initial conditions for fault zone rock at greater depth and which may itself host shallow slow slip;   
2. Characterize material properties, thermal regime, and stress conditions in the upper plate directly above the SSE source region; and   
3. Install observatories in the Pāpaku fault near the deformation front and in the upper plate above the SSE source to measure  

temporal variations in deformation, temperature, and fluid flow. The observatories will monitor volumetric strain (via pore pressure as a proxy) and the evolution of physical, hydrological, and chemical properties throughout the SSE cycle.  

Together, the coring, logging, and observatory data will test a suit e of hypotheses about the fundamental mechanics and behavior o f SSEs and their relationship to great earthquakes along the subduction interface.  

# Introduction  

Slow slip events (SSEs) involve transient aseismic slip on a faul t (lasting weeks to years) at a slip velocity intermediate between plat e tectonic rates and those required to radiate seismic waves. Onl y since the advent of dense, plate boundary–scale geodetic network s in the last ${\sim}15\,\mathrm{y}$ has the importance of these events as a significan t mode of fault slip been recognized. The observation of SSEs and associated seismic phenomena (e.g., tremor and low-frequency earthquakes) along subduction megathrusts worldwide (e.g., Schwart z and Rokosky, 2007) has ignited one of the most dynamic fields o f current research in seismology (e.g., Rubinstein et al., 2010; Pen g and Gomberg, 2010; Wech and Creager, 2011). Despite this intens e interest, the physical mechanisms that underlie SSEs and the relationship of SSEs to destructive seismic slip on subduction thrust s are poorly known.  

This deficiency in our understanding of SSEs is partly due to th e fact that most well-studied subduction zone SSEs (e.g., Cascadi a and southwest Japan) occur too deep for high-resolution imaging o r direct sampling of the source region. A notable exception is th e northern Hikurangi margin, New Zealand, where well-characterized SSEs occur every $1{-}2\ \mathrm{y}$ over a period of 2–3 weeks at depth s $<\!2{-}15\,\mathrm{km}$ below the seafloor (Wallace and Beavan, 2010; Wallace e t al., 2016) (Figure F1). The proximity of SSEs to the seafloor makes i t feasible to drill into and sample, collect downhole logs from, an d conduct monitoring in the near field of the SSEs and potentiall y even in the faults that host these events. The regularity and wellcharacterized short repeat interval of the SSEs allow monitorin g over multiple SSE cycles, with the potential to document the spatial and temporal distribution of strain accumulation and release an d any associated hydrogeologic phenomena.  

The scientific objectives of International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expeditions 372 and 375 were threefold:  

• Document the physical properties, hydrogeological properties, chemical properties, lithology, geometry, microstructure, and thermal state of the subduction inputs and Pāpaku fault located near (and possibly in) the shallowest reaches of SSE slip. The in

puts include the sediment and upper igneous crust of the subducting Pacific plate, with an emphasis on intervals that host or will eventually host SSEs.  

• Define the stress regime, thermal structure, porosity, permeability, lithology, pore fluid pressure state, fluid chemistry, flow pathways, and structural geology of the upper plate overlying the SSE source region.   
• Install observatories in the upper plate and in the Pāpaku fault that together span the SSE source region to monitor deformation and changes in temperature and hydrogeology related to SSEs.  

# Background  

# Geological setting  

In the region of the Expedition 372 and 375 drilling transect, th e Pacific plate subducts westward beneath the North Island of Ne w Zealand along the Hikurangi Trough at $4.5{-}5.5\;\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{y}$ (Wallace et al., 2004) (Figure F1). The subducting plate is composed of the Hikurangi Plateau, a Cretaceous large igneous province. The plateau sequence is overlain by a ${\sim}1~\mathrm{\km}$ thick Cenozoic to Mesozoi c sedimentary sequence (Figure F2) that increases to $>\!5\,\mathrm{km}$ in thickness to the south (e.g., south of ${\sim}40^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ ). The northern part of th e margin is currently primarily nonaccretionary and locally exhibit s frontal tectonic erosion associated with subducting seamount s (Lewis et al., 1998; Collot et al., 2001; Pedley et al., 2010). Wher e accretion does occur, the margin is characterized by a narrow, steeply tapered $\scriptstyle(>10^{\circ}$ taper angle) wedge (Barker et al., 2009).  A number of seamounts are present on the Pacific plate approachin g the deformation front (e.g., Tūranganui Knoll and Puke seamounts). The subduction thrust is identified as a décollement between  a highly deformed imbricated thrust wedge above a relatively less deformed subducting sequence.  

SSEs at the northern Hikurangi margin occur every 18–2 4 months and typically involve $1{-}3\;\mathrm{cm}$ of southeastward surface displacement at continuously operating GPS (cGPS) sites (Figure F1 ) along the coast. The portion of the subduction interface that undergoes slow slip is almost fully locked between the SSEs, and this sli p deficit is mostly or completely recovered by the SSEs (Wallace an d Beavan, 2010). The equivalent moment magnitudes of the larges t SSEs are typically Mw 6.5–7.0, with average slip of ${\sim}7\mathrm{-}20\,\mathrm{cm}$ on th e plate interface. These larger SSEs are punctuated by more frequen t smaller events (one or more per year) that are not as well characterized (see GPS time series inset in Figure F1). SSE slip in this area i s predominantly offshore, and the events appear to repeatedly rupture similar areas of the interface (Wallace and Beavan, 2010). A recent seafloor geodetic experiment has shown that slow slip occur s to within $\leq\!2\ \mathrm{km}$ of the seafloor along the Expedition 375 drillin g transect, and it is possible that slow slip continues all the way to th e trench (Wallace et al., 2016).  

Multichannel seismic data reveal that the source areas of som e SSEs (between ${<}5$ and ${>}10{-}16\,\mathrm{km}$ depth) correspond to the top of  a thick high reflectivity zone (HRZ) (Figures F1, F2) (Bell et al., 2010). The high-amplitude reflectivity has been hypothesized to resul t from undercompaction and high fluid pressures in sediments entrained between downgoing seamounts. Alternatively, the reflector s may represent lithologic packages (e.g., altered basaltic lavas or volcaniclastic sediments). If the former interpretation is correct, the n the inferred correlation between the HRZ and SSEs would suppor t the idea that fluid pressure is associated with the generation of slo w slip by reducing effective stress; if the latter interpretation is correct, the correlation would suggest a compositional control on faul t slip behavior (e.g., Kodaira et al., 2004; Liu and Rice, 2007; Audet e t al., 2009; Song et al., 2009; Saffer and Wallace, 2015).  

# Previous drilling in the region  

No previous scientific drilling has been undertaken at the Hikurangi subduction margin. A total of 44 industry exploration well s have been drilled onshore, ranging in depth from $_{<100}$ to $4352\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and 3 have been drilled offshore the east coast of the North Island. These wells target the East Coast Basin, which overlies much of th e inner Hikurangi forearc.  

Previous drilling during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 181 targeted the eastern portion of the Hikurangi Plateau (Sites 1123 an d 1124) ${\sim}900$ and ${\sim}600\,\mathrm{km}$ , respectively, east of the coast of the Nort h Island (Davy et al., 2008). Results of this drilling allow a preliminar y correlation of seismic facies (Plaza-Faverola et al., 2012; Ghisetti e t al., 2016; Barnes et al., 2018) that suggests the following Hikurang i Plateau stratigraphy:  

• A basal sequence of high-velocity $(>\!4\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s})$ basaltic rocks;   
• An overlying $3\,\mathrm{km}$ thick Hikurangi Basement Sequence (HKB) interpreted to comprise $120\;\mathrm{Ma}$ volcaniclastics and/or chert or limestone;   
• A late-stage $(100{-}90\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ) volcanic cone and seamount constructional sequence;   
• A $\AA:150{-}230\;\mathrm{m}$ thick sedimentary cover sequence comprising an upper sequence $(70-32\,\mathrm{{Ma})}$ of nannofossil chalk and mudstone and a possible lower sequence $\left(100{-}70\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ ) of clastic sedimentary rocks; and   
• $\mathrm{A\,1000{-}1200\,m}$ thick trench-fill cover sequence of late Cenozoic turbidites, mudstone, and debris flow deposits. At the deformation front beneath Puke Ridge (Figure F2), the subduction décollement lies $\sim\!2\,\mathrm{km}$ below the seabed in the upper part of the HKB.

# Scientific objectives (overall primary and secondary objectives)  

Logging (including LWD and wireline logging), coring, an d long-term observatories installed at the Hikurangi subduction margin drill sites during Expeditions 372 and 375 were planned to address a suite of hypotheses regarding slow slip and the mechanics o f subduction megathrusts:  

• SSEs propagate to the trench. They are not confined to a specific (narrow) pressure or temperature range.   
• Pore fluid pressure is elevated in the source region of SSEs. The elevated pore pressures are driven by a combination of compaction disequilibrium and mineral dehydration reactions that occur as sediments and altered igneous crust on the incoming plate are buried and heated during subduction.   
• SSEs occur in regions of conditional frictional stability. A single fault patch can exhibit different slip modes (e.g., steady creep, episodic slow slip, or seismic slip) depending on in situ conditions and state.   
• A continuum of duration and magnitude characteristics of SSEs and slow seismic behavior occurs along the shallowest reaches of the subduction megathrust.   
• SSEs drive fluid flow and chemical transport along faults and throughout the upper plate.  

Expeditions 372 and 375 undertook a coordinated program o f LWD, coring, and observatory installation framed around three primary scientific objectives designed to test these hypotheses. Thes e scientific objectives are outlined here and addressed in further detail below.  

1. Characterize the compositional, thermal, hydrogeological, frictional, geochemical, structural, and diagenetic conditions of the subducting material and Pāpaku fault.  

Achieving this objective requires characterization of the incoming stratigraphy and upper oceanic basement rocks, together wit h the Pāpaku fault, which forms a shallow active strand of the frontal thrust system. This characterization involves a combination of coring, downhole measurements, and logging at originally propose d Sites HSM-05A (now Site U1520; sedimentary succession on subducting plate), HSM-08A (now Site U1526; seamount on subducting plate), and HSM-15A (now Site U1518; Pāpaku fault ) (Figure F3), followed by a strategy of coordinated post-expeditio n laboratory analyses (Saffer et al., 2017). Site U1518 provides material from an active thrust in the updip region of the plate interfac e early in its evolution, at low temperature and low effective stress. I f SSEs propagate onto splay faults near the deformation front, th e Pāpaku fault zone sampled at Site U1518 may undergo slow slip; thi s possibility will be tested using data from the observatory installe d during the expedition. Site U1520 targeted the sediment package o n top of the Hikurangi Plateau. Site U1526 targeted a representativ e section of the upper portion of the Tūranganui Knoll seamount, which was thought to be composed of volcaniclastic sediment or altered basaltic basement.  

LWD data acquired during Expedition 372 at Sites U1518 an d U1520 documented sediment properties and structure and characterized stress orientations through analysis of wellbore failures a t Site U1518 (see the Site U1518 and Site U1520 chapters [Saffer e t al., 2019; Barnes et al., $2019c]$ ). Coring during Expedition 375 aime d to collect key samples and data sets for sediment/rock physical properties, pore fluid composition, and downhole temperature wit h a focus on hydrogeology and fault mechanical processes. Together, these data define the initial conditions and composition for both th e subducting crust and interstitial pore fluids, and samples of the incoming materials will be used for laboratory experimental studies o f rock physical and chemical properties to understand the in sit u properties and their evolution with progressive subduction. Thes e data and post-expedition studies will also yield critical informatio n to refine depth conversion of existing 2-D and 3-D seismic data an d thus to quantitatively extend knowledge of in situ properties an d conditions (stress, fault zone properties, and pore pressure) fro m the boreholes to a broader region (e.g., Tobin and Saffer, 2009). Ultimately, samples and geophysical data acquired at Sites U1518, U1520, and U1526 will constrain (1) the composition and frictiona l properties of subduction inputs and the shallow plate interface, (2) the hydrologic and thermal conditions of the incoming plate an d shallow fault, and (3) the structural character, stress conditions, an d mechanical properties of the main active thrust and subduction inputs.

Downhole temperature measurements were planned to defin e temperature profiles and, in combination with measurements o f thermal properties on core samples, provide information abou t shallow heat flow across the margin. These data will be used to constrain thermal models of the margin that define margin temperatur e structure and thus the thermal, diagenetic, and metamorphic environment of SSEs and to identify potential advective signatures associated with active fluid flow (e.g., Saffer et al., 2008; Peacock, 2009; Saffer and Wallace, 2015).  

2. Characterize the properties and conditions in the upper plate overlying the SSE source region.  

LWD resistivity image data acquired during Expedition 372 a t Site U1519 provide key information about fracture and faulting patterns. The data also document borehole breakouts, providing information about the maximum and minimum horizontal stres s orientations. In combination with rock physical properties data acquired from cores during Expedition 375, these data may also b e used to estimate horizontal stress magnitudes (e.g., Moos and Zoback, 1990; Zoback et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2013; Huffman and Saffer, 2016).  

Core samples from Site U1519 acquired during Expedition 37 5 will also enable measurements of rock elastic and other physica l properties needed to confidently interpret observatory data (e.g., Wang and Davis, 1996; Sawyer et al., 2008; Hammerschmidt et al., 2013), to assess the role of upper plate properties in possible triggering of SSEs (e.g., Wallace et al., 2017), and to define realistic roc k properties to inform models of SSE slip (e.g., Williams and Wallace, 2018). Analysis of pore fluid chemistry allows identification of th e source region of fluids in the hanging wall above and surroundin g the SSE region to assess whether fluids from depth flow upward an d escape through the fractured and structurally disrupted hangin g wall and to quantify flow pathways, rates, and driving forces (e.g., Kopf et al., 2003; Hensen et al., 2004; Ranero et al., 2008; Kastner e t al., 2014).  

# 3. Monitor deformation, hydrogeology, and chemistry via borehole observatories.  

Installation  of  borehole  observatories  was  planned  in  th e Pāpaku fault (Site U1518) and in the hanging wall above the sourc e area of large SSE slip (Site U1519) (Figures F2, F3). The observator y at Site U1518 includes multilevel pore fluid pressure sensing above, in, and below the fault zone and high-resolution downhole temperature monitoring using a string of 30 autonomous temperatur e sensors (Figures F4, F5). Time series of fluid flow rates and flui d geochemistry in the fault zone interval will be collected usin g OsmoSamplers and an OsmoFlowmeter (Jannasch et al., 2004; Solomon et al., 2009). The observatory at Site U1519 involves a simple r design (Figure F4) with two levels of formation pressure sensing an d a string of 15 temperature sensors. Both observatories incorporat e pressure sensing at the wellhead to provide a seafloor reference fo r the downhole pressure sensors to allow removal of oceanographi c signals; the wellhead sensors may also provide data to resolve vertical deformation of the seafloor (e.g., Wallace et al., 2016).  

The main goals of the observatories are as follows:  

• Monitor temporal variations in pore fluid pressure, temperature, fluid geochemistry, and flow rate in the fault zone, hanging wall, and footwall of the Pāpaku fault (Site U1518) as well as pressure and temperature in the hanging wall further landward (Site U1519) through several SSE cycles. These data will quantify ambient pore pressure, provide information about potential links between hydraulic and geochemical transients and SSEs, and constrain the source region of fluids associated with SSEs (e.g., Solomon et al., 2009; Davis et al., 2011). • Determine ambient temperatures and the geothermal gradient to better constrain the thermal regime of slow slip. • Determine formation hydraulic and elastic properties using tidal and other oceanographic forcings (e.g., Kinoshita et al., 2018). • Integrate pore pressure changes (as a direct proxy for volumetric strain) in a broader framework of deformation monitoring from an existing network of onshore cGPS and seafloor sensors to constrain the spatial and temporal distribution of slip during SSEs (e.g., Araki et al., 2017).

# Site summaries  

Site U1518  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1518 is located on the lower continental slope near th e trench and ${\sim}73\,\mathrm{km}$ from shore at ${\sim}2630\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figures F2, F3; Table T1) (see the Site U1518 chapter [Saffer et al., 2019]). Thi s site is located on the forelimb of an anticline formed by an activ e thrust, the Pāpaku fault, which branches from the plate interfac e (Figure F2). The fault is thought to accommodate a component o f plate motion in this portion of the Hikurangi margin, and it is possible that it hosts SSEs. Both LWD during Expedition 372 and corin g during Expedition 375 were planned to extend through the Pāpak u fault near the deformation front, terminating $150{-}200\ \mathrm{m}$ into th e footwall (Figure F2). Drilling was expected to encounter accrete d Pleistocene trench-fill sediments comprising hemipelagic mud, sand and mud turbidites, ash, and mass transport deposits (MTDs ) in both the hanging wall and footwall. The primary operational objectives at this site were (1) coring and downhole logging to tota l depth with the highest priority of sampling the lower ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{m}$ of th e hanging wall, the fault zone, and the footwall of the thrust (including additional possible deeper subsidiary faults suggested on the basis of seismic data) and (2) installing a subseafloor observatory t o monitor changes throughout the slow slip cycle in and surroundin g the fault zone.  

The main scientific objectives of coring and downhole logging a t Site U1518 were to define the structures and deformation, physica l properties, lithology and composition, and interstitial fluid geochemistry of the active thrust fault and surrounding sediments. Coring and LWD results were used to define the depth interval fo r observatory pore pressure monitoring and geochemical sampling i n the fault zone and to select optimal locations for pore pressur e monitoring in the hanging wall and footwall.  

Key foci for post-expedition studies on core samples and downhole logging data include but are not limited to  

• Structural analyses to characterize deformation mechanisms and style and fracture and fault orientations (e.g., Byrne et al., 2009);   
• Analysis of wellbore failures (breakouts and tensile fractures) to characterize contemporary maximum and minimum stress orientations and, with constraints on rock strength, potentially constrain absolute stress magnitudes;   
• Laboratory measurements of fault and wall rock rheology to test hypotheses linking fault constitutive properties to slip behavior (e.g., Saffer and Wallace, 2015; Leeman et al., 2016);   
• Geomechanical and thermal properties measurements to define poroelastic, strength, and heat transport properties of the formation and to guide interpretation of observatory data (e.g., Wang, 2004; Sawyer et al., 2008; Davis et al., 2009; Kinoshita et al., 2018); and   
• Strength, permeability, and elastic moduli measurements to provide context for the interpretation of borehole failures as indicators of in situ stress magnitude, parameterization of deformation and hydrologic models, and core-log-seismic integration.

The vessel was offset $5\;\mathrm{m}$ north, the bit was raised another $3\;\mathrm{m}$ , and Hole U1518E was spudded at $1125\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 14 March 201 8 $38^{\circ}51.5669^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $178^{\circ}53.7618\,\mathrm{E};$ ; 2626.1 mbsl). Cores 1H–32X penetrated from 0 to 175.6 mbsf and recovered $160.96\mathrm{~m~}$ $(92\%)$ . Advanced  piston  corer  temperature  tool  (APCT-3)  formatio n temperature measurements were taken with Cores 4H, $6\mathrm{H}$ , 8H, $10\mathrm{H},$ and 14F. The decision was made to switch to coring with th e rotary core barrel (RCB) system after discovering that the cuttin g shoe used with Core 31X had been destroyed after it took $80\,\mathrm{{min}}$ t o advance $3.6\;\mathrm{m}$ while cutting Core 32X.  

# Hole U1518F  

The vessel was offset $5\,\textrm{m}$ south. Hole U1518F $38^{\circ}51.5694^{\prime}\mathrm{S},$ $178^{\circ}53.7619\mathrm{\,E}$ ; $2626.1~\mathrm{mbsl}$ ) was spudded at $0135~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 Marc h 2018 with an RCB BHA and was advanced without coring to 197. 7 mbsf. Cores 2R–32R penetrated from 197.7 to 494.9 mbsf and recovered $126.82\mathrm{~m~}(43\%)$ . Coring was terminated so that observator y operations could start.  

# Hole U1518G  

In preparation for installing the observatory, we predrilled Hol e U1518G. The vessel was offset $35\;\mathrm{m}$ north of Hole U1518F (and ${\sim}5$ m south of Hole U1518B). A BHA with a $14\%$ inch drill bit was lowered to the seafloor, Hole U1518G $38^{\circ}51.5505^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $178^{\circ}53.7617\,\mathrm{E};$ $2629.8\;\mathrm{mbsl}_{\cdot}$ ) was spudded at $1050\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 March 2018, and the hol e was advanced without coring to 433 mbsf. Next, a reentry cone an d mud skirt were released from the moonpool and allowed to free-fal l down the drill string to the seafloor.

The first stage of the observatory installation consisted of deploying an ACORK (Figure F4). Between $2000~\mathrm{h}$ on 22 March an d $1700~\mathrm{h}$ on 23 March, we assembled a $422\textrm{m}$ long ACORK casin g string consisting of $10\%$ inch casing, three joints with pressur e screens, and an umbilical with three $\%$ inch diameter tubes secure d on the outside of the casing. The umbilical tubes were terminated a t the three screens centered at 393, 323, and 218 mbsf to monito r pressure below, within, and above the fault zone, respectively. Next, we assembled a drilling assembly inside the ACORK casing composed of a $9\%$ inch drill bit, an underreamer with its arms set to $14\%$ inches, and a mud motor to rotate the bit and underreamer in isolation from the casing. Finally, the umbilical tubes were connected t o the valves and loggers on the ACORK wellhead, and the entir e ACORK assembly was lowered to the seafloor on 24 March. Durin g our attempt to reenter Hole U1518G, unexpected heave caused th e drill bit to hit the reentry cone at $1215\,\mathrm{h}$ , which resulted in the con e and its base being offset ${\sim}3{-}5\;\mathrm{m}$ from the hole and making reentr y into the predrilled hole impossible.  

# Hole U1518H observatory  

Because the underreamer and drill bit were inside the ACOR K casing and the entire assembly was already at the seafloor, the decision was made to drill-in the ACORK assembly at the new location. Hole U1518H $38^{\circ}51.5402^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $178^{\circ}53.7642\,\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{\Omega}}$ ; 2631.1 mbsl) was spudded at $1245~\mathrm{h}$ on 24 March 2018 and reached a total depth of 42 6 mbsf. Once the ACORK landed in the reentry cone, we deployed  a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) platform and a free-fall funnel o n top of the ACORK body. The ACORK casing was reentered an d cleaned of cuttings on 26 March before a bridge plug was installe d on 27 March at 421 mbsf inside the ACORK casing to seal its interior from the formation.  

The second stage of the observatory installation consisted of deploying a CORK-II inside the ACORK, but operations were interrupted on 28 March while we waited for the R/V Tangaroa t o deliver replacement seals. During this period we relocated to Sit e U1520 to drill-in a reentry system in advance of coring there late r during the expedition. We resumed operations in Hole U1518H o n 31 March by assembling the $412\,\textrm{m}$ long CORK-II casing strin g composed of $4\%$ inch drill pipe, two swellable packer joints, on e “quadrant seal” joint carrying the seat for the OsmoSampler package, drill collars, and a bullnose. The CORK-II wellhead was attached on 1 April, and the entire assembly was lowered to th e seafloor until it reentered the ACORK funnel and the CORK-I I wellhead reached ${\sim}17\,\mathrm{m}$ above the ACORK funnel.

The third stage of the observatory installation consisted of deploying the temperature sensors and OsmoSampler package insid e the CORK-II casing string. On 1 April, we assembled the $407\,\mathrm{m}$ lon g instrument string consisting of 3 segments of Spectra rope carryin g a total of 23 temperature sensors, the ${\sim}22\mathrm{~m~}$ long OsmoSample r package with an additional 7 temperature sensors inside, 3 wea k links, 4 sinker bars, and a top plug. The instrument string was deployed with the logging wireline. At $2105~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 April, the OsmoSampler package landed in the CORK-II seat at 323 mbsf, followe d by the top plug latching inside the CORK-II wellhead. Once the instrument string was released, the CORK-II landed inside th e ACORK wellhead at $0020\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 April, completing the observator y installation in Hole U1518H. The time spent at Site U1518 durin g Expedition 375 was 13.22 days. The total time spent at Site U151 8 during both expeditions was 16.62 days.  

# Principal results  

# Logging while drilling  

Six LWD tools were deployed on the BHA (NeoScope, SonicScope, TeleScope, proVISION, geoVISION, and StethoScope) whil e drilling Holes U1518A (118 mbsf) and U1518B $(600~\mathrm{mbsf})$ durin g Expedition 372, providing both real-time and recorded-mode dat a to the targeted depth (Table T1). Based on the LWD physical properties measurements, we identified six main logging units that wer e divided into subunits based on the observed physical propertie s characteristics of the sediments (Figure F6). We interpreted numerous significant features from the logs, such as the thrust fault zon e and associated sand/silt units. The fault zone, interpreted to be a t ${\sim}322~\mathrm{mbsf},$ is associated with a reduction in resistivity and densit y and an increase in porosity with depth. The hanging wall of the faul t is characterized by high $P$ -wave and $S{\mathrm{.}}$ -wave velocities, whereas th e footwall is characterized by relatively lower velocities. A high-amplitude seismic reflection interval in the footwall sequence is associated with interpreted sandy sediments characterized by increase d borehole washout deeper than 350 mbsf. In this interval, an abrup t

change in physical properties occurs close to 370 mbsf, where w e interpret a deeper fault strand. As described in more detail below, clusters of both resistive and conductive fractures were observed i n the resistivity images, more commonly in the fault hanging wall sequence. Borehole breakouts oriented approximately north–sout h were observed toward the base of the hole, from which we infer a n east–west maximum horizontal stress direction.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

At Site U1518, we identified three lithostratigraphic units, tw o of which (Units I and III) were divided into two subunits (Figur e F7). All three units are Quaternary in age. Sediment compositio n and texture are consistent throughout Holes U1518E and U1518F, with a background of silty clay(stone) or mud(stone) alternatin g with thin beds of silt(stone) to silty sand(stone). The distinction s among lithostratigraphic units are based largely on the character o f coarser beds inferred to be turbidites and soft-sediment deformation features that are inferred to be MTDs.

The uppermost $2.2~\mathrm{m}$ of Core 375-U1518E-1H consists of unconsolidated Holocene mud. Subunit IA includes this Holocen e drape, starts at the seafloor, and extends to 197.7 mbsf. Sedimen t from Section 1H-CC is older than $0.53\ \mathrm{Ma}$ in age, and porosity i s lower than expected for the current depth of burial (Figure F8). W e therefore consider some of the original stratigraphic section to b e missing because of submarine slides or other forms of mass wastin g after frontal accretion. The normally graded beds range in grain siz e from sandy silt to silty sand and very fine sand. We surmise that relatively dilute turbidity currents were interspersed with backgroun d settling of suspended sediment on the trench floor of the Hikurang i Trough. Felsic ash layers also occur in the uppermost $44\;\mathrm{m}$ , probably deposited by air fall. Subunit IB extends from 197.7 to 304. 5 mbsf and is characterized by sparse and thinner $\left(<\!10\;\mathrm{cm}\right)$ beds o f normally graded siltstone. The subunit boundary is gradational, an d its position coincides with the bottom of the zone that was no t cored.  

Unit II extends from 304.5 to 370.4 mbsf, and its upper boundary matches a significant change in biostratigraphy defined by  a thrust-related age inversion with older hanging wall material (olde r than $0.53\;\mathrm{Ma}_{}^{}$ ) over younger footwall sediments (younger than 0.5 3 Ma). We designated this material as a separate lithostratigraphi c unit on the basis of a sharp reduction in the number of silty turbi

This unit is composed of mudstone with thi n beds of normally graded siltstone and sandy siltstone; the sediment s were deposited by turbidity currents and hemipelagic settling in  a trench-floor environment. The most distinctive characteristic of Uni t III is soft-sediment deformation that is similar in many respects to wha t has been described in MTDs from comparable depositional environments elsewhere (e.g., the Nankai Trough). Subunits IIIA and IIIB ar e separated based on a change in the frequency of the MTD-type features at 475.7 mbsf. The amount of soft-sediment deformation decreases significantly in Subunit IIIB. Intricate varieties of bioturbatio n also become more widespread and diverse below the subunit boundary.  

Broad facies-level comparisons (i.e., packets of beds at a $10+\,\mathrm{m}$ scale) can be made between the lithostratigraphy defined from cor e descriptions and the provisional log-based stratigraphy defined i n Holes U1518A and U1518B (see Logging while drilling in the Sit e U1518 chapter [Saffer et al., 2019]) (Figure F6). Six logging unit s were defined for Site U1518 during Expedition 372. The loggin g unit designations were based on attributes that change in respons e to deformation structures and physical properties and lithology an d bed thicknesses. Closely spaced oscillations in resistivity, nuclea r magnetic resonance (NMR), porosity, and gamma ray measurements from Logging Units 2 and 3 are consistent with thinly bedde d and uniformly fine grained sediments in Lithostratigraphic Unit I. Unit II (304.53–370.4 mbsf) likely represents lithologies comparable with those in the lower parts of Logging Subunit 3C (229–320. 7 mbsf) and Unit 4 (320.7–346 mbsf). The top boundary of Unit II i s based largely on the inversion of biostratigraphy rather than  a change in lithology, which cannot be detected by logging. In contrast, the Unit III upper and lower boundaries do not match ver y closely to the boundaries for Units 5 and 6 or their subunits, likel y because different sets of criteria were used to define subunits. Recognition of Unit III is based largely on an increase in syndepositional deformation in the form of contorted domains, whic h are interpreted to be MTD-type deposits. In contrast, the designations for logging units rely mainly on changes in physical propertie s and caliper records suggestive of washouts.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Planktonic foraminifer and calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy indicates that the sedimentary sequence recovered from Sit e U1518 is Holocene to Pleistocene. Biostratigraphic dating indicate s a high sedimentation rate of $2.8\;\mathrm{m/ky}$ in the Pleistocene section.  

The base of the Holocene (younger than $0.011\;\mathrm{Ma}$ ) was identified between 1.97 and $2.33~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . The underlying section from 2.3 3 to 296.9 mbsf is from the Middle Pleistocene to possibly early Pleistocene (older than $0.53\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ). Sediments from 306.95 to 492.26 mbs f are Middle Pleistocene or younger $(0.126{-}0.53\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) and represen t an age reversal at the top of the structurally defined thrust fault, a s described below (see Structural geology) (Figure F7).  

Midbathyal benthic foraminifer markers occur throughout th e sedimentary sequence, and very rare lower bathyal markers occur i n a few samples deeper than 306.95 mbsf. The absence of lowe r bathyal markers in most samples is unexpected, given that the sit e was drilled at $2626~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , suggesting that the bulk of the sedimentary sequence has been reworked downslope from midbathyal water depths or shallower. Downslope reworking is supported by th e presence of common inner to midshelf taxa in some samples.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Routine paleomagnetic analysis included natural remanen t magnetization (NRM) measurement of archive halves prior to an d following stepwise alternating field (AF) demagnetization to a pea k field of $30\,\mathrm{mT}.$ Interpretation of the paleomagnetic results was compromised by diagenesis of the primary magnetic mineral phases an d extensive tectonic deformation. Some cores also experienced cor e disturbance that resulted in the complete destruction of any depositional remanence. All XCB cores were affected by significant drilling-induced overprints that could not be removed during routin e demagnetization of the archive halves. More extensive AF and thermal demagnetization experiments were conducted on discret e specimens to aid our interpretation.  

Inclination records show that the entire sequence recovere d from Site U1518 is most likely of normal polarity, despite an interva l between 220 and 270 mbsf in which the polarity remains unresolved. Based on biostratigraphic observations, we place the paleomagnetic record in the Brunhes Normal Chron (C1n).  

Rock magnetic analyses included determination of the magneti c coercivity distribution based on AF demagnetization, isothermal remanent magnetization acquisition, and magnetic susceptibilit y measurement. Inferences about the blocking-temperature $(T_{\mathrm{b}})$ distribution of individual samples were drawn from the thermal demagnetization behavior. We tentatively identified at least tw o magnetic mineral phases. The first phase is a low-coercivity $_{\left\langle{\le50}\right.}$ mT) mineral that we suggest is titanomagnetite. During AF demagnetization experiments, the majority of our samples were affecte d by the growth of a gyroremanent magnetization at treatment step s higher than $50~\mathrm{mT}$ that we attribute to the presence of secondar y greigite.  

# Structural geology  

Cores from Hole U1518E are characterized by sediments wit h gently to moderately dipping beds, although significant drilling-induced deformation in the APC and XCB cores prevents detaile d structural observations. RCB cores from Hole U1518F preserve  a suite of deformation structures that define the Pāpaku fault zone, which spans from 304.5 to 361.7 mbsf. This zone includes a mai n brittle fault zone extending from 304.5 to 322.4 mbsf, a subsidiar y fault from 351.2 to 361.7 mbsf, and an intervening zone of less intense brittle-ductile deformation.  

Gently to steeply dipping beds, locally overturned, were observed in the hanging wall. Variations in bedding dip angles in th e hanging wall (Figure F8) generally agree well with LWD image log– derived bedding dips. These beds are crosscut by moderately t o steeply dipping fractures that increase in frequency with depth toward the fault zone. Normal faults with centimeter-scale displacements are also preserved at scattered locations throughout th e sequence.  

The main fault zone includes an upper fault that contains mixe d brittle and ductile structures extending to 322.4 mbsf. This interval is characterized by intense brecciation, discrete fractures, and ductilely deformed intervals. Several of the ductilely deformed zone s are overprinted by brittle structures. Deformation intensity decreases gradually with depth, except in a few localized bands, fro m the base of the main fault zone to a subsidiary fault at 351.2 mbs f (Figure F8). The subsidiary fault is marked by more intense ductil e deformation and increased frequency of faults, fractures, and breccias from 351.2 to 361.7 mbsf. There is no clear change in litholog y across this subsidiary fault. The ductile deformation is likely a composite of tectonic, synsedimentary, and slope processes.  

The footwall below 361.7 mbsf is characterized by relatively undeformed hemipelagic sediments with modest and relatively constant dip angles and is cut by a few normal faults and fractures. Th e generally gentle bedding dips are in good agreement with LWD-derived dips.  

Fractures were observed at various depths in the Site U151 8 LWD resistivity image logs acquired during Expedition 372 (se e Logging while drilling in the Site U1518 chapter [Saffer et al., 2019]). Significant fracture clusters were observed between 170 an d 230 mbsf, between 315 and 321 mbsf (at a comparable depth, although slightly deeper than those observed in the main fault zone i n Hole U1518F; Figure F8), and between 436 and 444 mbsf. Thes e clusters include a mix of conductive and resistive fractures, an d overall they exhibit a preferred northwest–southeast strike.  

# Geochemistry  

We collected 82 whole-round (WR) samples for pore wate r chemical analyses at Site U1518. Each core collected deeper than 3 0 mbsf was scanned with an infrared (IR) camera to identify col d anomalies indicative of potential gas hydrate. The majority of W R samples taken for interstitial water analyses were located away fro m the IR anomalies to define background chemical profiles not impacted by gas hydrate dissociation during core recovery. A small subset of samples co-located with the IR cold anomalies were analyzed to quantify gas hydrate saturations based on the deviation o f dissolved chloride concentrations from the background profile. Drilling fluid was also analyzed as part of the shipboard geochemical program to identify potential contamination; below the sulfate– methane transition zone (SMTZ), sulfate is depleted in the pore water and any sulfate present in a sample is interpreted to be the resul t of contamination. Based on $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ concentrations below the SMTZ , we corrected all pore water species in each sample for drilling contamination.  

The pore fluid chemical profiles at Site U1518 reflect the combined effects of microbially mediated organic matter degradation, authigenic carbonate precipitation, volcanic ash alteration, and silicate mineral diagenesis. Sulfate concentration decreases approximately linearly from $28.1~\mathrm{mM}$ at 1.5 mbsf to below detection limi t $(0.1\mathrm{~mM)}$ at ${\sim}8$ mbsf. The SMTZ is marked by a concomitant increase in headspace methane concentration from 51 to 5461 part s per million by volume (ppmv). The SMTZ is shallower at this sit e than at nearby Site U1517 (drilled during Expedition 372 [Barnes e t al., 2019a]), which likely indicates a larger vertical methane flux. Ethane was detected in some headspace samples shallower than 20 0 mbsf but was not detected deeper. Methane/ethane ratios ar e ${>}20{,}000$ , suggesting a microbial origin of the methane.  

Alkalinity, ammonium, bromide, and phosphate concentratio n profiles also reflect organic matter diagenesis, with peaks in Lithostratigraphic Subunit IA followed by decreases in Subunit IB. Th e fault zone coincides with repetition of the diagenetic sequence i n the footwall, with a second peak in alkalinity, ammonium, and phosphate concentrations in Unit III. Based on the deviation of Cl concentration from the background concentration profile, we identifie d the presence of gas hydrate in six WR samples.  

Chloride, potassium, and sodium concentrations increase wit h depth and reach concentration maxima at ${\sim}60$ mbsf in Lithostratigraphic Subunit IA. Likewise, silica, lithium, and strontium concentrations steadily increase in Subunit IA and then decrease betwee n the top of Subunit IB and the top of the fault zone at $\mathord{\sim}300$ mbsf. Subunit IA sediments contain several volcanic ash layers and disseminated ash and have elevated K-feldspar concentrations. The increase in pore water Cl, alkali metal, and strontium concentration s in this unit likely reflects ongoing alteration of rhyolitic ash and Kfeldspar to authigenic hydrous aluminosilicate minerals. Similar t o the geochemical tracers of organic matter diagenesis discusse d above, clear repetition of the ash/silicate mineral diagenetic sequence occurs at the fault zone.  

Solid-phase analyses yielded calcium carbonate $\left(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\right)$ ) content ranging from 2.1 to $23.1\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ . Total organic carbon (TOC) content is generally low and ranges from 0.1 to $0.88~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . C/N ratio s range from 0.85 to 15.80 (average $=6.84\$ ). Localized peaks in $C/\Nu$ ratios occur in Lithostratigraphic Unit II, suggesting some heterogeneity in organic matter sources in this depth interval.  

# Physical properties  

An abrupt change in physical properties occurs between 0 an d 50 mbsf in Hole U1518E and includes a shift to lower porosity, concomitant higher bulk density, and higher $P$ -wave velocity. Deepe r than $50~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , all physical properties remain nearly constant wit h depth, with a few distinct exceptions. The depth trends of bulk density, porosity, $P$ -wave velocity, undrained shear strength, and natura l gamma radiation (NGR) measured in the cores are generally les s pronounced than the trends in LWD bulk density, neutron porosity, $P$ -wave velocity, and gamma ray data.  

Porosity decreases from $65\%$ to $50\%$ in the uppermost $50\,\mathrm{m}$ . Between 50 and 495 mbsf, porosity is nearly constant and ranges fro m $40\%$ to $50\%$ (Figure F8). $P$ -wave velocity is ${\sim}1500\ \mathrm{m/s}$ near the seafloor, increases rapidly to $1600\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ at 2 mbsf, and then remains approximately constant at $1600\ \mathrm{m/s}$ between 2 and 12 mbsf. Deepe r than 238 mbsf, $P$ -wave velocity values are scattered and range fro m $\mathord{\sim}1500$ to ${\sim}2000~\mathrm{~m/s~}$ . Undrained shear strength increases wit h depth (albeit with significant scatter) to an average of $120{-}200\ \mathrm{kPa}$ at 200–280 mbsf and decreases to an average of $60{-}100\,\mathrm{kPa}$ by 30 0 mbsf. Deeper than 450 mbsf, strength increases again (with significant scatter) to values as high as $400{-}500\,\mathrm{kPa}$ .  

NGR ranges from 6 to 63 counts/s, with an average of 4 2 counts/s. NGR increases rapidly from ${<}25$ counts/s at the seafloo r to 40 counts/s at 2 mbsf and remains nearly constant with depth. Magnetic susceptibility is correlated with the lithostratigraphi c units. The interval between 2 and 176 mbsf (in Lithostratigraphi c Subunit IA) is characterized by zones of low magnetic susceptibilit y and less scatter, with an average magnetic susceptibility of $11\times10^{-5}$ to $14\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ (at 2–12, 40–60, and 75–109 mbsf) and intervenin g zones of high magnetic susceptibility and more scatter, with an average of $22\,\times\,10^{-5}$ to $25\,\times\,10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}$ (at 13–40, 60–75, and 109–17 6 mbsf). Between 197.7 and 462 mbsf, from the top of Subunit IB t o the bottom of Subunit IIIA, magnetic susceptibility exhibits som e scatter, ranging from $10\times10^{-5}$ to $20\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ , but with less scatte r than that observed in Subunit IA. Magnetic susceptibility shifts to  a lower average value of $13\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ at 466 mbsf and remains constan t to 495 mbsf (in Subunit IIIB). Thermal conductivity is relativel y constant with depth, with an average of $1.38\pm0.10\,\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{(m{\cdotK})}$ .  

# Downhole measurements  

Five formation temperature measurements were made with th e APCT-3 in Hole U1518E with Cores 4H, 6H, 8H, 10H, and 14F. Although all five measurements are high quality, an offset occurs between the three measurements taken with one sensor and the tw o taken with another sensor. We estimate a thermal gradient o f $0.035^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{m}$ using three equilibrium temperatures from one of thes e tools. The vertical conductive heat flow computed as the product o f the thermal gradient and thermal conductivity is $48~\mathrm{mW/m^{2}}$ . Th e temperature over the depth window corresponding to the Pāpak u fault zone is estimated to be $12^{\circ}{-}13^{\circ}C$ .  

# Core-log-seismic integration  

LWD data from Holes U1518A and U1518B (Figure F6) wer e correlated with core-based observations and physical propertie s measurements from Holes U1518E and U1518F and with seismi c reflection data across the holes drilled at Site U1518. These different data sets detect variations in physical properties, lithology, an d structure at a range of scales. LWD $P$ -wave velocity and densit y measurements were combined with density measurements from th e cores to develop a synthetic seismic trace to correlate the LWD, core, and seismic data. The synthetic seismic trace using the LW D data correctly predicts moderate-amplitude reflections in the uppe r $80\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , low-amplitude reflections to ${\sim}300~\mathrm{mbsf},$ and a package o f high-amplitude reflections between 300 and 400 mbsf (Figure F8).  

However, a significant reduction in LWD density and velocit y around 322 mbsf (Figure F6) produced a high-amplitude reverse d polarity reflection in our synthetics that is $\mathord{\sim}15\mathrm{{-}}20\;\mathrm{m}$ too deep relative to the observed high-amplitude reversed polarity reflection i n Seismic Profile 05CM-04 at the Hole U1518F location. This highamplitude reflection separates truncated dipping reflections abov e from continuous parallel reflections below. Physical properties values from cores show a reduction in density around $300{-}315~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , which is shallower than that observed in the LWD data (Figure F8) . Together, the core and seismic data suggest that the fault zone in th e Hole U1518F cored section lies $15\mathrm{-}26\mathrm{~m~}$ shallower than the sam e change in properties identified in the Hole U1518B LWD data. Thi s suggestion is supported by a better matching synthetic seismic trac e when the LWD reduction in density and velocity is shifted $15\,\mathrm{~m~}$ shallower (Figure F8). The difference in fault zone depth betwee n Holes U1518F and U1518B (located ${\sim}40\mathrm{~m~}$ apart) is likely due t o thrust fault geometry.  

# Site U1519  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1519 is located on the upper continental slope ${\sim}38~\mathrm{km}$ from shore in ${\sim}1000\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth at the landward edge of a midslope sedimentary basin (Figures F2, F3; Table T1) (see the Sit e U1519 chapter [Barnes et al., 2019b]). On the basis of regional stratigraphic and seismic interpretations prior to drilling, we expected to penetrate $260{-}270\;\mathrm{m}$ of horizontally layered late Quaternary basin fill comprising MTDs and layered sequences, includin g probable turbidites, underlain by a Pliocene–Pleistocene slope sequence of MTDs and layered sequences, also about $260{-}270\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick, dipping to the southeast. The base of this sequence is marke d by an apparent erosional unconformity identified in the seismic reflection data at $\mathord{\sim}540$ mbsf. Beneath the unconformity, we expecte d to penetrate Miocene sedimentary rocks (equivalent to the Tolag a Group exposed onshore) in seismically reflective landward-dippin g strata (Figure F2).  

The primary objective at Site U1519 was installation of an observatory to monitor pore fluid pressure and temperature, as described above. The observatory includes two levels of pressur e sensing via hydraulic lines that terminate in screens at 124 and 26 4 mbsf. Temperature sensing is achieved by a string of 15 autonomou s high-resolution temperature sensors. LWD in Hole U1519A durin g Expedition 372 penetrated to 650 mbsf. Drilling at Site U151 9 during Expedition 375 included RCB coring in discrete interval s (108–163.6, 250–288.4, and 520–640 mbsf; Hole U1519C) and AP C coring from the seafloor to 85.8 mbsf (Holes U1519D and U1519E). The main logging and coring objectives at this site were to provid e information about rock physical properties, composition, an d structural geology and deformation in the upper plate above the SS E source region. APCT-3 measurements of temperature in Hole s U1519D and U1519E define a temperature gradient and provide ke y constraints on the thermal regime of the slow slip source region. Pore water geochemistry data provide insights into diagenetic processes and potential fluid sources and flow pathways in the hangin g wall.  

One key focus for post-expedition studies on core samples wil l be geomechanical measurements to define poroelastic and strengt h properties of the formation. These data will be essential for interpretation of observatory data, such as calibrating the use of por e pressure as a proxy for volumetric strain (e.g., Wang, $2004;$ Araki e t al., 2017). Similarly, strength, permeability, and elastic moduli measurements will provide important context for interpretation o f borehole failures as indicators of in situ stress magnitude (e.g., Chang et al., 2010; Huffman and Saffer, 2016), parameterization o f hydrological models, and core-log-seismic integration. Detaile d analyses of wellbore failures identified in the LWD data may revea l contemporary maximum and minimum horizontal stress orientations. Comparison of these data with similar stress determination s elsewhere along the Hikurangi margin will enable evaluation of regional variations in current stress state across the margin. Therma l properties measurements will be used in combination with observatory temperature data to define heat flow and to interpret therma l transients in the context of heat conduction and possible advection.

Transit to Site U1519  

The vessel arrived at Site U1519 (proposed Site HSM-01 A [Saffer et al., 2017]) at $0530~\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{(UTC}+13\,\mathrm{h})$ ) on 24 December 201 7 after a $15.4\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1518.

We arrived at Site U1519 at $1810~\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{UTC}\,+\,12\ \mathrm{h})$ ) on 13 Apri l 2018 after waiting on weather conditions to improve in the Bay o f Plenty.  

# Hole U1519B observatory  

In preparation for installing the observatory, we predrilled th e observatory hole. A BHA with a $14\%$ inch drill bit was lowered t o the seafloor. Hole U1519B $38^{\circ}43.6426^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $178^{\circ}36.8655^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; 1000. 4 mbsl) was spudded at $0105~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 April 2018 and advanced without coring to 283 mbsf. Next, a reentry cone and mud skirt wer e released from the moonpool and allowed to free-fall down the drill string to the seafloor.  

The first stage of the observatory installation consisted of deploying an ACORK (Figure F4). Between 0115 and $1245\,\mathrm{h}$ on April 15, we assembled a $279\;\mathrm{m}$ long ACORK casing string consisting o f 22 joints of $10\%$ inch casing, two casing joints with $2\,\mathrm{m}$ long screen s for pressure monitoring, and an umbilical with three $\%$ inch diameter tubes (only two of which were used) secured on the outside o f the casing. The umbilical tubes were terminated at the two screen s centered at 124 and 264 mbsf. Next, we assembled a drilling assembly inside the ACORK casing composed of a $9\%$ inch drill bit, a n underreamer with its arms set to $14\%$ inches, and a mud motor t o rotate the bit and underreamer in isolation from the casing. Finally, the umbilical tubes were connected to the valves and loggers on th e ACORK wellhead, and the entire ACORK assembly was lowered t o the seafloor at $2130~\mathrm{h}$ on 15 April. Hole U1519B was reentered a t $2310\,\mathrm{h}$ , and the ACORK wellhead landed in the reentry cone on th e seafloor at $0635~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 April. Once the ACORK was released, w e deployed a free-fall funnel on top of the ACORK body. The ACOR K casing was reentered with a $9\%$ inch drill bit and cleaned of cutting s on 16 April before a bridge plug was installed on 17 April inside th e ACORK casing at 277 mbsf to seal its interior from the formatio n below.  

The second stage of the observatory installation consisted of deploying a CORK-II inside the ACORK. The $269\mathrm{~m~}$ long CORK-I I casing string consisted of 20 full joints and four pup joints of $4\%$ inch casing, four $6\%$ inch drill collars, and a bullnose. The CORK-I I wellhead was attached, the entire assembly was lowered to the seafloor, and it reentered the ACORK funnel at $_{0120\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ on April 18. W e lowered the CORK-II wellhead until it reached a position ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{~m~}$ above the ACORK funnel.  

The third stage of the observatory installation consisted of deploying a string of temperature sensors inside the CORK-II casing. At $0230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 April, we started assembling the $268~\mathrm{m}$ long instrument string consisting of a top plug, a single segment of Spectr a rope with 15 temperature sensors, one weak link, and one sinke r bar. The instrument string was deployed using the logging wireline, and the top plug latched inside the CORK-II wellhead at $0530\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 18 April. Once the instrument string was released, the CORK-I I landed inside the ACORK wellhead and was released at $0735~\mathrm{h}$ o n 18 April, completing the observatory installation in Hole U1519B.  

# Hole U1519C  

The primary coring objective at Site U1519 was to sample sediment in the intervals surrounding the ACORK pressure screens, which are centered at 124 and 264 mbsf, and in the sedimentary section from $\mathord{\sim}520$ to 640 mbsf. The vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ from Hol e U1519B at a heading of $122^{\circ}.$ , and Hole U1519C $38^{\circ}43.6483^{\prime}\mathrm{S},$ $178^{\circ}36.8773\,\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{\Lambda}}$ ; $1000.3\,\mathrm{\mbsl}_{\mathrm{}}$ ) was spudded at $1640~\mathrm{h}$ on 18 April 2018. Drilling without coring continued to 108 mbsf until $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 19 April. RCB Cores 2R–7R, 9R–12R, and 14R–26R advanced fro m 108.0 to 640.0 mbsf and recovered $119.17\;\mathrm{m}$ $(55\%)$ . Intervals $163.6-$ 250.0 and 288.4–518.4 mbsf were drilled without coring. The drill string was recovered at $0815\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 April, and the RCB BHA wa s put away.  

# Hole U1519D  

The final objective at Site U1519 was to core the shallow sedimentary section and collect in situ temperature measurements wit h the APCT-3. The vessel was offset $10~\mathrm{m}$ at a heading of $122^{\circ}$ , an d Hole U1519D ( $38^{\circ}43.6516^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $178^{\circ}36.8831\mathrm{\,E}$ ; $1000.4\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ ) was spudded at $1505\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 April 2018. APC Cores 1H–3H advanced fro m 0 to 23.2 mbsf and recovered $23.64\mathrm{~m~}$ $(101\%)$ . Nonmagnetic cor e barrels were used for all APC cores. Because coarse unconsolidate d material made it difficult to collect in situ temperature measurements and resulted in a partial stroke and significant overpull wit h Core 3H, we started a new hole.  

# Hole U1519E  

The vessel was offset $^{20\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ at a heading of $122^{\circ}$ , and Hol e U1519E $38^{\circ}43.6572^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $178^{\circ}36.8949^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; $1000.3\;\mathrm{mbsl})$ ) was spudded a t $1845\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 April 2018. APC Cores 1H–8H and HLAPC Cores 9F– 13F advanced from 0 to 85.8 mbsf and recovered $88.75\mathrm{~m~}$ $(103\%)$ . Nonmagnetic core barrels were used for all cores. Formation temperature measurements were taken with the APCT-3 for Cores 4H– 8H, 9F, 11F, and 13F. The time spent at Site U1519 during Expedition 375 was 8.79 days. The total time spent at Site U1519 durin g both expeditions was 10.96 days.  

# Principal results  

# Logging while drilling  

Hole U1519A was logged to the target depth of 650 mbsf. Si x LWD tools were deployed on the BHA (NeoScope, SonicScope, TeleScope, proVISION, geoVISION, and StethoScope) while drilling Hole U1519A, providing both real-time and recorded-mod e data. Based on the LWD measurements, three main logging unit s and ten subunits were identified (Figure F9). From 140 to 220 mbsf, significant low values of NGR, resistivity, and velocity caused b y washout of the borehole are associated with an inferred increase i n sand content. Other similar intervals are recognized near 300 an d 450 mbsf. Deeper than $550~\mathrm{mbsf}$ (coinciding with an unconformit y identified in the seismic data), resistive layers are well identified i n the imaged interval. The intervals are characterized by high resistivity and velocity spikes. Bedding features show varied dips and di p directions throughout the borehole. Fractures are generally spars e throughout the borehole but include a notable high-density cluste r just below ${\sim}230$ mbsf. Borehole breakouts identified from 597 t o 650 mbsf are oriented approximately northeast–southwest, inferring a maximum horizontal stress $\left(S_{\mathrm{Hmax}}\right)$ directed northwest– southeast.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

We identified two lithostratigraphic units at Site U1519 (Figur e F10). Detailed characterization of lithofacies was hampered by larg e coring gaps, poor recovery, and pervasive coring disturbance. Overall, the sedimentary strata range in age from Holocene to early Pleistocene. Common lithologies include mud(stone), silt(stone), an d sand(stone).  

Coring started at the seafloor in Holes U1519D and U1519E an d at 108 mbsf in Hole U1519C, in Lithostratigraphic Unit I. Core s from this depth range contain a background of dark greenish gra y mud and mudstone (silty clay to clayey silt) with variable levels o f consolidation.  Seismic  reflection  records  and  high-resolutio n bathymetry are indicative of shallow mass transport remobilizatio n at Site U1519. However, APC cores from Holes U1519D an d U1519E reveal no definitive indicators of gravity-driven, soft-sediment deformation in the hemipelagic mud.  

The Lithostratigraphic Unit I/II boundary at 282.66 mbsf displays a noticeable change in color from dark greenish gray above t o light greenish gray below, and the grain size coarsens somewhat t o silt-rich mudstone. A positive excursion in magnetic susceptibilit y also occurs. Below a $230\;\mathrm{m}$ gap in coring, mudstone is present wit h scattered thin interbeds of dark gray sandy siltstone to very fin e sandstone. In Cores 375-U1519C-19R, 21R, and 22R, the mudston e displays clear evidence of soft-sediment deformation, includin g convolute laminae, mesoscale folds, dismembered bedding, an d clasts of mudstone supported by a mudstone matrix. We interpre t the deformed zones to be intraformational MTDs. The remainde r of Unit II consists of consolidated greenish gray mudstone interbedded with poorly indurated sandy silt and sand, ranging in size u p to coarse sand. Core 23R contains a distinctive matrix-supporte d conglomerate with widely dispersed clasts of mudstone and intac t shells of what appear to be shallow-water fauna.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer species indicate that the sedimentary sequence recovered at Site U1519 is Holocene to Pleistocene (Figure F10). The base of the Holocene wa s identified between 4.40 and 14.00 mbsf. The underlying section t o 536.32 mbsf is dated Late to Middle Pleistocene $(0.011{-}0.62\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ), indicating a sedimentation rate of ${\sim}0.84~\mathrm{m/ky}.$ . Deeper than 536.4 1 mbsf to the base of Hole U1519C, the age is poorly constrained bu t is likely early Pleistocene or younger (younger than $1.73\,\mathrm{Ma}_{\mathrm{,}}$ ).  

Highly variable planktonic foraminifer abundances in the uppe r part of the section $(0{-}536.32\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) fluctuate between outer neriti c and oceanic values. This variability is attributed to downslope reworking, evident from the co-occurrence of inner shelf benthic tax a and shell fragments with bathyal markers. In the lower part of th e section (546.86–635.6 mbsf), benthic markers indicate depositio n in mid–lower bathyal or deeper water depths.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic analyses at Site U1519 were compromised by severe core disturbance that destroyed the depositional remanence i n the majority of cores. We thus only analyzed RCB cores from deepe r than 525 mbsf in Hole U1519C and APC cores from Holes U1519 D and U1519E. Cores 375-U1519C-14R through 26R were subjecte d to stepwise AF demagnetization to peak fields of 30 or $40\;\mathrm{mT}$ . Overprinting of the primary NRM, most likely by diagenetic alteration, and deformation in MTD intervals made it difficult to interpret th e magnetostratigraphy.  

Hole U1519D and U1519E cores were subjected to AF demagnetization to a peak field of $20\;\mathrm{mT},$ , which was sufficient to remove  a small viscous overprint. The NRM directions usually have negativ e inclinations that agree with the directions expected for a normal polarity field. However, the data have not been corrected for core disturbance, and many APC sections were affected by significan t drilling-induced bed drag. As a result, downhole variations in NR M directions do not necessarily reflect temporal variations in the magnetic field during sediment deposition.  

# Structural geology  

Intense drilling disturbance, coring gaps, and poor recovery i n cored intervals hampered recognition of structural features i n cores. However, dip data from LWD image logs provide useful context for observations of core structures (Figure F11). Much of th e strata at Site U1519 are inclined, although bed dips rarely exceed $50^{\circ}$ in the cored intervals. Steeper beds are recorded in folded strata, which likely represent MTDs. We defined two structural domain s based on structures in the core and LWD data. In Domain 1 (0– $567.58\,\mathrm{\mbsf})$ , bedding dips are dominantly steep, and scattered, steep, dominantly conductive fractures are present in the LWD resistivity image logs. Filled fractures are abundant in the lower recovered interval of Domain 1. Domain 2 (567.58–635.6 mbsf) coincide s with the bottom of lithostratigraphic Unit II and is defined by a decrease in the number of filled fractures, a slight shallowing of bedding dips in core, and a change in regional dip azimuth from northnortheast toward the north-northwest.

# Geochemistry  

In total, $100\;\mathrm{WR}$ samples were collected and squeezed for shipboard and shore-based pore water geochemical analyses. The geochemical profiles at Site U1519 reflect the combined effects o f organic matter diagenesis, authigenic carbonate precipitation, an d silicate mineral/volcanic ash alteration in response to rapid sedimentation. The pore water sulfate, alkalinity, ammonium, bromide, and phosphate profiles in Lithostratigraphic Unit I show change s with depth that are characteristic of organic matter degradation. The shallow pore water sulfate profiles in Holes U1519D an d U1519E are S-shaped, indicating a recent period of rapid sedimentation that is also indicated by the alkalinity profile between the seafloor and the SMTZ.  

![](images/6e37ee84a0625db83e85d02ecc80e334397570f794935f7630278b27473999b2.jpg)  
Figure F10. Stratigraphic column, Holes U1519C–U1519E. Gamma ray, caliper, and resistivity are from LWD measurements acquired during Expedition 372. T D $=$ total depth.  

A sharp increase in ammonium, alkalinity, phosphate, and bromide concentrations occurs across the Lithostratigraphic Unit I/I I boundary, indicating that a second concentration maximum occur s in Unit II. The exact depth of this second concentration maximu m is unknown because of the coring gap between 285 and 520 mbsf. The concentrations of these species, which are related to organi c matter diagenesis, remain elevated in the interval from 520 to 63 5 mbsf but decrease with depth.  

Dissolved calcium concentration decreases sharply from 9. 5 $\mathrm{mM}$ at 1.4 mbsf to $3.8\;\mathrm{mM}$ at the SMTZ. Below the SMTZ, calciu m concentration increases to $6.3\ \mathrm{mM}$ at 70 mbsf. The reversal in th e Ca profile below the SMTZ suggests enhanced silicate mineral/volcanic ash alteration in the zone of microbial methanogenesis, leading to a net addition of Ca to the pore water despite concurren t removal in authigenic carbonates. Likewise, strontium concentration increases below the SMTZ to $130~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ $50\%$ higher than seawater value), boron concentration increases to ${\sim}750~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ $79\%$ higher than seawater value), and potassium concentrations steadil y decrease, consistent with silicate and/or volcanic ash diagenesis i n the upper $100\mathrm{~m~}$ of Unit I. A second interval of enhanced silicat e mineral/volcanic ash diagenesis occurs between 520 and 630 mbs f in Unit II.  

Chloride concentration is lower than average modern seawate r value $^{\leftmoon}\mathrm{{[559~mM)}}$ in the upper portion of Lithostratigraphic Unit I, increasing from $549~\mathrm{mM}$ at 1.4 mbsf $2\%$ lower than average seawater value) to $559~\mathrm{mM}$ at 17 mbsf. Between 17 and 120 mbsf, Cl concentration remains relatively constant at or near a seawate r value. Chloride concentration decreases from $550{-}534\ \mathrm{mM}$ acros s the Unit I/II boundary to $440{-}546\ \mathrm{mM}$ between 520 and 630 mbsf. Discrete anomalies in the Cl profile at 520–630 mbsf are the resul t of gas hydrate dissociation during core recovery, marking zones o f elevated gas hydrate concentrations. However, background Cl concentration is also lower at 520–630 mbsf.  

Between the seafloor and 144.3 mbsf, headspace methane concentrations range between 0.55 and 5172.48 ppmv. Deeper tha n 144.3 mbsf, methane concentration decreases and remains betwee n

212.28 and 1802.82 ppmv, with an average of 1011.35 ppmv. Ethan e was detected in headspace samples deeper than 520.53 mbsf an d ranges between 0.25 and 1.92 ppmv. Methane/ethane ratios are consistently ${>}500$ , indicating a dominantly microbial methane source. Organic carbon values in Lithostratigraphic Units I and II rang e from 0 to $1.2\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ (average $=0.39\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ). Inorganic carbon and tota l nitrogen contents increase slightly with depth in both lithostratigraphic units and range from 0.05 to $1.95~\mathrm{wt\%}$ (average $=1.1\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ ) and from 0.00 to $0.09\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ (average $=0.05\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ ), respectively. C/ N ratios range from 0.85 to 14.92.  

# Physical properties  

NGR, magnetic susceptibility, gamma ray attenuation (GRA ) bulk density, and $P$ -wave velocity were measured using the WholeRound Multisensor Logger (WRMSL). Thermal conductivity wa s measured on WR core sections. Discrete $P$ -wave velocity, moistur e and density (MAD), and undrained shear strength were measure d on working halves. MAD porosity values decrease from $74\%$ nea r the seafloor to ${\sim}40\%$ at 85 mbsf (Figure F11). At 109–135 and $250-$ $284\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , porosity values are nearly constant at $41\%{-}45\%$ and $37\%-$ $43\%$ , respectively. Between 520 and 635 mbsf, porosity increase s slightly with depth and ranges between $34\%$ and $48\%$ . Although coring was conducted only in isolated intervals, MAD porosity an d density values are in good agreement with those from LWD. $P.$ -wav e velocity values range from 1500 to $1600\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ between 0 and 10 mbsf, but the data are unreliable for the rest of the borehole.  

Undrained shear strength increases linearly from 0 to ${\sim}180\,\mathrm{kPa}$ with an average depth-dependent gradient of $2.5\;\mathrm{kPa}/\mathrm{m}$ between  0 and 85 mbsf in Holes U1519D and U1519E. In Hole U1519C, shea r strength remains mostly constant, with average values of ${\sim}62\ \mathrm{kPa}$ between 105 and 140 mbsf, $30{-}300\,\mathrm{kPa}$ between 250 and 290 mbsf, and $54{-}1104\;\mathrm{kPa}$ between 515 and 555 mbsf. NGR ranges from ${\sim}0$ to 70 counts/s in Hole U1519C and is relatively uniform through th e cored intervals, with an average of 40 counts/s. Magnetic susceptibility is nearly constant between 0 and 150 mbsf and ranges from 1 0 $\times\,10^{-5}$ to $30\,\times\,10^{-5}$ SI, except for a few ash layers where magneti c susceptibility reaches as much as $300\,\times\,10^{-5}$ SI. Between 250 an d 283 mbsf, magnetic susceptibility ranges from $15\times10^{-5}$ to $20\times10^{-5}$ SI and increases to $40\times10^{-5}$ to $50\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ at 283 mbsf, which corresponds to the Lithostratigraphic Unit I/II boundary. Thermal conductivity ranges from 0.8 to $1.6\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\mathrm{{\cdotK}})$ between the seafloo r and 80 mbsf. Between 109 and 135 mbsf, thermal conductivity i s uniform at ${\sim}1.3\ \mathrm{W/(m{\cdot}K)}$ . Deeper than 250 mbsf, thermal conductivity increases to ${\sim}1.4\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ .  

# Downhole measurements  

Formation temperature measurements were taken with th e APCT-3 with Cores 375-U1519E-4H through 8H, 9F, 11F, and 13F. The APCT-3 measurements yield in situ temperature values fro m $6.44^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at 31 mbsf to $7.91^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at 86 mbsf and define a thermal gradien t of $24.3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ . Using a mean thermal conductivity value of 1.3 1 $\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K})$ , the heat flow is estimated as ${\sim}33\mathrm{\mW/m^{2}}$ .  

# Core-log-seismic integration  

LWD data acquired during Expedition 372 in Hole U1519 A were correlated with core-based observations and physical properties measurements from Holes U1519C–U1519E and with seismi c reflection data across the site in the Tuaheni Basin. LWD $P$ -wave velocity and density measurements were used to develop a syntheti c seismic trace to correlate the LWD, core, and seismic data (Figur e F11), which allowed us to assess the match between the seismi c traces that would be predicted from the physical properties in th e boreholes with seismic sections acquired across Site U1519 prior t o the expedition. Based on the new seismic tie, we defined three major seismic units and compared them with LWD data from Expedition 372 and lithostratigraphic units from Expedition 375.  

The upper seismic unit is $281\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and comprises a horizontally layered basin-fill sequence, including at least two interprete d MTDs in the upper $141\,\mathrm{m}$ and a thick underlying section of inferre d highly reflective, presumably sandy, sediments that were not cored. Cores from recovered intervals in this seismic unit comprise mudstones with minor sand and volcanic ash that are younger than 0.5 3 Ma in age. Both observatory screens were deployed in silty mudstone intervals in this unit. The middle seismic unit is a seawarddipping $265\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick slope sequence partially buried by the uppe r seismic unit. This interval includes a mixture of layered sediment s and MTDs interpreted in the seismic data. Only the upper $_{3.5\mathrm{~m~}}$ and lower $27\,\textrm{m}$ of this sequence were cored, and these interval s consist of predominantly fine grained mudstone. The lower seismi c unit is a strongly reflective interval that dips landward, likely as  a result of uplift and tilting by thrust faulting. Cores recovered fro m this unit to 635 mbsf consist of mudstone and MTDs containin g coarser material, which have been dated at $0.54{-}1.73\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , which i s younger than the expected Miocene/Pliocene age that was inferre d prior to drilling.  

# Site U1520  

# Background and objectives  

The primary objective at Site U1520 was to log and sample th e sedimentary sequence on the subducting Pacific plate to provide insight into the lithologies and conditions expected deeper along th e subduction interface and in the SSE source area. The site lies ${\sim}95$ km from shore and $16\,\mathrm{km}$ east of the deformation front at ${\sim}3520\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figures F2, F3; Table T1) (see the Site U1520 chapte r [Barnes et al., $2019\mathrm{c}]$ ). Site U1520 was expected to encounter sediments and rocks of late Quaternary to Cretaceous age based on regional seismic stratigraphic interpretation of the Hikurangi Platea u and Hikurangi Trough stratigraphy (Figure F2) (Barnes et al., 2010; Davy et al., 2008). The upper ${\sim}610{-}640\mathrm{~m~}$ of the section was expected to consist mainly of mud and sand turbidites, hemipelagi c sediment, debris flow material, and minor ash of predominantl y Pliocene–Quaternary age. The package from $\mathord{\sim}640$ to $\mathord{\sim}840$ mbs f was expected to comprise Late Cretaceous, Paleogene, and Miocen e sedimentary rocks of the Hikurangi Plateau cover sequence, including nannofossil chalk, mudstone, tephra, and sandstone with possible unconformities. The strongly reflective sequence deeper tha n 840 mbsf was interpreted to include basalts, volcaniclastic sediments, and breccia along with intervals of pelagic chert and/o r limestone (e.g., Davy et al., 2008).  

The highest priorities at Site U1520 were to measure and recover the materials deeper than ${\sim}600$ mbsf that represent the protolith for material transported into the SSE source region. Tim e constraints during Expedition 372 limited drilling with LWD to 75 0 mbsf at this site, which was short of the planned target of $1200\,\mathrm{mbsf}.$ To maximize our ability to sample the deep portion of the sectio n during Expedition 375, we drilled in casing to 642 mbsf in Hol e U1520C and conducted RCB coring below the casing to 1054. 1 mbsf. Following coring, we conducted wireline logging in the ope n hole below the casing from 642 to 947 mbsf. We returned to Sit e U1520 later during the expedition to conduct APC/XCB coring i n Hole U1520D to sample the upper $642\;\mathrm{m}$ of the section.  

The scientific objectives of coring and logging at Site U152 0 were to define the structures and deformation, physical properties, lithology and composition, and interstitial fluid geochemistry of th e incoming material prior to subduction. These data will also be use d for core-log-seismic integration across the Hikurangi Trough. Priorities for post-expedition analysis include but are not limited t o measurement of the mechanical, elastic, frictional, and hydrological properties of the incoming sediment and basement along with detailed compositional analyses.  

# Expedition 372 operations  

Transit to Site U1520  

The vessel arrived at Site U1520 (proposed Site HSM-05 A [Saffer et al., 2017]) at $1302\,\mathrm{{h}}$ $\mathrm{[UTC+13\h)}$ on 26 December 201 7 after a $28\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1519.  

# Hole U1520A  

The LWD BHA was made up with the geoVISION, NeoScope , TeleScope,  SonicScope,  and  proVISION  tools.  Hole  U1520 A $38^{\circ}58.1641^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , 179°7.9357ʹE; 3521.3 mbsl) was spudded at $0845\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 27 December 2017. LWD data were collected from 0 to 97.9 mbs f with continuous safety monitoring. Operations in Hole U1520 A were terminated early because of deteriorating weather conditions.  

# Hole U1520B  

After waiting on weather for $45.75\ \mathrm{h}$ (1.91 days), Hole U1520 B $38^{\circ}58.1587^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}7.9233^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; 3520.1 mbsl) was spudded at $1245\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 29 December 2017. LWD measurements were collected from 0 t o 750 mbsf with continuous safety monitoring.  

# Expedition 375 operations  

Transit to Site U1520  

We first occupied Site U1520 while waiting for Tangaroa to deliver replacement seals needed for the observatory installation a t Site U1518. We arrived at Site U1520 at $0257\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{UTC}+12\,\mathrm{h})$ ) on 2 8 March 2018.  

# Hole U1520C  

First, we fabricated the base of the reentry cone, assembled th e hydraulic release tool (HRT) needed to deploy the reentry system, assembled a casing string consisting of 54 joints of $10\%$ inch casin g and a casing shoe, and secured the casing string in the moonpool a t $_{0130\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ on 29 March 2018. Next, we put together the drilling assembly needed to drill in the reentry system. The drilling assembly wa s composed of a $9\%$ inch drill bit, an underreamer with its arms set t o $14\%$ inches, and a mud motor to rotate the bit and underreamer i n isolation from the casing. The underreamer arms were tested, an d the drilling assembly was completed and landed inside the casing a t  

$0500~\mathrm{h}$ on 29 March. The drilling assembly and HRT were connected to the casing and mud skirt, the reentry cone was assemble d in the moonpool, and the reentry system was lowered to the seafloor. While the reentry system was being lowered to the seafloor, Tangaroa arrived at $1615\,\mathrm{h}$ to deliver the replacement seals neede d for the CORK-II installation at Site U1518.  

The subsea camera was deployed to monitor the reentry con e and  base  while  drilling  it  into  the  seafloor.  Hole  U1520 C $\langle38^{\circ}58.1532^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}7.9112\mathrm{^E}$ ; 3522.1 mbsl) was spudded at $1940\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 29 March, and it took ${\sim}27\,\mathrm{h}$ for the bit to reach a total depth of 64 6 mbsf with the casing shoe at 642 mbsf. Once the drilling system wa s released from the reentry system, we recovered the subsea camer a and then the drill string at $1120~\mathrm{h}$ . With the reentry system completed, we departed for Site U1518 at $1310~\mathrm{h}$ on 31 March to complete the observatory installation there.  

We returned to Site U1520 on 2 April following a ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{h}$ deviation to the Gisborne Pilot Station for a personnel transfer an d reached Hole U1520C at $1848~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 April. We assembled an RC B coring assembly and reentered Hole U1520C at $0525~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 April. The next several hours were spent cleaning cuttings out of the inside of the $642~\mathrm{m}$ deep casing. RCB coring started at $1200~\mathrm{h}$ on  3 April. Cores 2R–44R penetrated from 646.0 to 1054.1 mbsf and recovered $235.81\textrm{m}(58\%)$ . Nonmagnetic core barrels were used for al l cores. Coring was terminated so that Hole U1520C could be logge d before the weather deteriorated.  

To prepare Hole U1520C for logging, we circulated the cutting s out of the hole with mud and recovered the RCB BHA. The subse a camera was deployed to check the reentry cone, which appeared t o have sediment inside, and the cone was flushed with seawater. Onc e the drill string was recovered, we made up a logging BHA and lowered it to the seafloor. Hole U1520C was reentered at $0250~\mathrm{h}$ on  9 April, and the drill pipe was set at 599 mbsf for logging, $42\;\mathrm{m}$ abov e the casing shoe. We deployed a modified triple combo tool strin g with the following tools (from the bottom up):  

• Dipole Shear Sonic Imager (DSI; sonic velocity),   
• High-Resolution Laterolog Array (HRLA; resistivity),   
• Hostile Environment Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS; caliper only, without the density source), and   
• Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC; gamma ray and telemetry).  

We made two logging passes from 642 to 947 mbsf where we encountered an obstruction $107~\mathrm{m}$ from the bottom of the hole. Th e tools were back on the rig floor at $1505~\mathrm{h}$ on 9 April, and the dril l string was recovered at $0010~\mathrm{h}$ on 10 April, ending operations i n Hole U1520C. The next objective for the expedition was to instal l an observatory at Site U1519 and core at Site U1526.  

# Hole U1520D  

After a ${\sim}6\,\mathrm{h}$ transit from Site U1526, we arrived at the specifie d coordinates of Hole U1520D at $2305\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 April 2018. Our objective for Hole U1520D was to core the uppermost sediment (shallower than $646~\mathrm{\mbsf})$ ) that we drilled without coring in Hol e U1520C. After assembling an APC/XCB BHA, Hole U1520 D $38^{\circ}58.1475^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}7.8991\mathrm{\,E}$ ; $3520.3\,\mathrm{mbsl}$ ) was spudded at $0850\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 25 April. Cores 1H–67X advanced from 0 to 642.3 mbsf and recovered $318.38\,\mathrm{m}\left(62\%\right)$ . In this interval, we drilled without coring fro m 189.3 to 220.0 mbsf and from 270.8 to 366.6 mbsf. Coring was suspended from $1600~\mathrm{h}$ on 29 April to $1315\ \mathrm{h}$ on 30 April while w e waited on weather. Nonmagnetic core barrels were used with al l APC cores. Formation temperature measurements were taken wit h the APCT-3 for Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, 13H, 16H, 19F, 23F, and 27F. The time spent at Site U1520 during Expedition 375 was 18.26 days. The total time spent at Site U1520 during both expeditions wa s 21.16 days.  

# Principal results  

# Logging while drilling  

Six LWD tools (NeoScope, SonicScope, TeleScope, proVISION , geoVISION, and StethoScope) were deployed in Holes U1520A an d U1520B, providing both real-time and recorded-mode data (Tabl e T1). In both holes, the resistivity image quality is degraded becaus e of tool stick and slip caused by the high drilling penetration rate.  

References to major reflection units determined from seismi c sections were used to help define logging units in the sedimentar y section. Nine logging units were identified in Hole U1520B, reflecting significant changes in the sediment physical properties recorde d by the logs (Figure F12). The uppermost $100\;\mathrm{m}$ is interpreted to b e relatively sandy sediment, mainly turbidities, associated with borehole washouts. These overlie ${\sim}110\ \mathrm{m}$ of finer grained sediments o f what is interpreted to be the Ruatoria MTD. The sediments beneat h the Ruatoria MTD comprise alternating fine- and coarser graine d sedimentary packages that show progressively increasing densit y and decreasing porosity with depth to a boundary at ${\sim}510$ mbsf. A t this depth, a marked change to sediments with a different acousti c character, higher density, and significantly lower gamma ray signature is evident. Several units with distinct logging characteristics ar e identified in the lower $150~\mathrm{m}$ of the borehole. Although the logs d o not enable direct identification of the rock type, the petrophysical characteristics and the tie to seismic reflectivity indicate that th e drilled section corresponds to the pelagic sequence overlying th e Hikurangi Plateau. Owing to generally poor hole conditions and  a fast rate of penetration, the image logs are poor quality throug h much of the drilled section in both Holes U1520A and U1520B. Dipping beds, however, were identified in many of the logging units. Above ${\sim}510\,\mathrm{mbsf_{\mathrm{:}}}$ , bedding dip inclination and azimuth appear to b e variable, particularly in the Ruatoria MTD. In the underlying sequence, the bedding dips are most commonly at low angles to th e northwest, west, and southwest. Several high-angle resistive fractures were identified in the sediments between 100 and 150 mbs f and between 660 and 710 mbsf in Hole U1520B.

Six lithostratigraphic units were defined from cores collected a t Site U1520 (Figure F13). The sediments and sedimentary rock s range in age from Cretaceous to Holocene. Thin tephra layers ar e scattered throughout most of the succession.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I begins at the seafloor and extends t o 110.5 mbsf. This interval consists of greenish gray hemipelagic mu d punctuated by graded beds of dark gray silt and sand. We interpre t the coarser beds to be products of deposition by turbidity current s on the floor of the Hikurangi Trough.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit II (110.5–222.0 mbsf) consists of hemipelagic mud with silt interbeds. These turbidites are generally fine r grained and thinner than those recovered in Unit I. Based on interpretations of seismic reflection data, Unit II is thought to represen t the distal edges of the Ruatoria debris avalanche. However, mesoscopic evidence is lacking for the types of soft-sediment, gravitydriven deformation expected in a submarine slide or debris flow deposit (e.g., truncated and rotated laminae, irregular bedding dips, fragmentation of cohesive mud clasts, clasts-in-matrix fabrics, an d flow banding).

Lithostratigraphic Unit III (222.0–509.82 mbsf) is similar t o Unit I but without thick sand beds. The turbidites are characterize d by graded beds of fine sand to silt with planar- and cross-laminae. We interpret the depositional environment to be in the Hikurang i Trough during a period of time in which turbidity currents were les s frequent, more dilute, and finer in grain size.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit IV begins at 509.82 mbsf in Hol e U1520D and extends to 848.45 mbsf in Hole U1520C. Lithologie s change markedly across the Unit III/IV boundary to a strongly lithified Pleistocene–Paleocene pelagic carbonate facies that include s light greenish gray marl, light brownish gray calcareous mudstone, and pale brown chalk. Secondary lithologies include matrix-supported gravity-flow deposits and volcanic tuff. The debris flow deposits display contorted to fragmented marl and chalk, togethe r with angular to subrounded clasts of volcaniclastic sandstone an d vesicular basalt.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit V (848.45–1016.24 mbsf) is dominate d by heavily altered, granule-sized volcaniclastic conglomerate. Thes e Cretaceous deposits are characterized by subangular clasts of basal t that range in size from a few millimeters to $6\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ . The fabric range s from clay matrix supported to clast supported, and the mechanism s of emplacement probably included grain flow and debris flow. Alteration of the basalt clasts to palagonite and clay minerals (smectite) is pervasive. Zeolite (phillipsite) and calcite are commo n cements.

Lithostratigraphic Unit VI (1016.24–1045.75 mbsf) comprises a blend of rock types whose stratigraphic organization and thicknesses are not resolvable. Much of the unit contains alternating volcaniclastic conglomerate and siliceous mudstone with a distinctive dark bluish gray to greenish gray color. Additional lithologies include pyrite-rich siltstone, organic-rich black mudstone, white limestone, reddish brown siltstone, and vesicular basalt with amygdules.  

# Biostratigraphy  

The sedimentary sequence and upper portion of the Hikurangi Plateau basement cored at Site U1520 represent a discontinuous Holocene to Late Cretaceous succession comprising several hiatusbounded packages. Planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils indicate that Holes U1520D and U1520C recovered Holocene sediment (younger than 0.011 Ma) from 0 to 5.88 mbsf, Pleistocene sediment (0.011–2.17 Ma) from 15.40 to 537.11 mbsf,  

![](images/8d047e47992e2ca50d03e322e670f03b8d75f8b938e72ff96c5d92aadd358ac1.jpg)

Pliocene sediment from 543.45 to 577.32 mbsf, a Pliocene/Miocen e boundary sequence from 587.74 to 592.94 mbsf, Miocene sedimen t from 609.71 to 746.82 mbsf, late Oligocene sediment from 756.62 t o 766.15 mbsf, middle to early Eocene sediment from 775.17 to 825.4 7 mbsf, and middle to early Paleocene sediment from 827.04 to 848.0 1 mbsf.  

The underlying volcaniclastic sequence (849.96–1045.75 mbsf ) spanning lithostratigraphic Units V and VI is largely unfossiliferous, except for 950.22–953.45 and 1016.69–1017.82 mbsf, where Lat e Cretaceous foraminifers were recovered. Organic-rich sediment s from 1036.57 to 1037.17 mbsf also include poorly preserved radiolarian faunas and siliceous branching tube-like fossils of unknow n affinity. Minor reworking of planktonic foraminifers is eviden t throughout the cored sedimentary succession but is most notable a t ${\sim}512$ mbsf, where common, well-preserved middle to early Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene taxa are present in a Pleistocene fauna, an d at $\mathord{\sim}588$ mbsf, where late Miocene $\mathbf{\left<8.96-9.63\Ma\right>}$ ) taxa dominate  a Miocene/Pliocene boundary fauna.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic investigations included NRM measurement o f archive halves prior to and following stepwise AF demagnetizatio n to peak fields of 30 or $40\;\mathrm{mT}.$ In addition, 1–2 discrete samples pe r core were subjected to more detailed AF or thermal demagnetization. The data quality and processing strategy differed somewhat fo r  

Holes U1520C and U1520D as a result of the different coring systems used, core disturbance, and recovery. With few exceptions, characteristic remanent magnetization directions calculated fro m data sets based on discrete samples were mostly coherent.  A magnetostratigraphy was produced with confidence for APC an d RCB cores (375-U1520D-1H through 30H and 375-U1520C-2 R through  Section 23R-6)  and  tentatively for  XCB cores (375- U1520D-31X through 66X). The volcaniclastic deposits of Lithostratigraphic Units V and VI all yield steep negative inclinations, suggesting that the entire unit may have been remagnetized. Th e Brunhes/Matuyama Chron boundary was identified at $413\mathrm{\mbsf},$ which is roughly consistent with biostratigraphic ages. Additional polarity horizons will be identified post-expedition.  

# Structural geology  

The sediments encountered at Site U1520 are generally undeformed. Bedding dips gently $(<\!30^{\circ})$ over the entire depth of the hole, with the exception of folded strata in debris flow deposits. The resistivity image log shows some intervals of steeper dips that are no t recognized in the cores. Discrete small displacement deformatio n features were observed throughout Hole U1520C (646–1036 mbsf ) but are largely absent shallower than 596.4 mbsf in Hole U1520 D (Figure F14).  

Distinct structural domains are broadly correlated with lithostratigraphic units. Domain 1 (0–596.4 mbsf) is defined by subhorizontal to gently dipping beds with no discrete deformatio n features. Several high-angle resistive fractures were identified i n LWD image logs between 100 and 150 mbsf. Deeper than 596. 4 mbsf, faults (normal when sense of slip was determined) and dissolution features are present throughout Domain 2 (596.4–848.4 5 mbsf), which consists of calcareous clay-rich sediments (Figur e F14). These observations are consistent with high-angle resistiv e fractures documented in LWD image logs between 660 and 71 0 mbsf in Hole U1520B. Domain 3 is characterized by veins that ar e common in the variably cemented volcaniclastic sediments tha t make up this interval (848.45–1016.24 mbsf). Domain 4 (1016.24– 1045.75 mbsf) coincides with Lithostratigraphic Unit VI, where deformation structures include several minor faults and few scattere d veins.  

# Geochemistry  

In total, 89 WR samples were collected and squeezed for shipboard and shore-based pore water chemical analyses. Despite th e high bulk density and cemented nature of the sediments recovere d from Hole U1520C, pore water was recovered from all three lithostratigraphic units. The geochemical profiles at Site U1520 are complex and likely reflect the combined effects of organic matte r diagenesis,  nonsteady-state  sedimentation,  volcanic  ash/silicat e mineral diagenesis, carbonate mineral diagenesis, solute diffusion, and potential lateral fluid flow in the volcaniclastic sediments o f Lithostratigraphic Unit V.  

Chloride concentrations increase linearly to a peak at 51.3 mbs f (Figure F14), decrease to 142 mbsf, and remain relatively constan t to the base of Lithostratigraphic Unit III. Collectively, these profile s suggest a zone of localized volcanic ash alteration/silicate minera l diagenesis and the precipitation of hydrous aluminosilicate minerals in Unit I. Below this zone, in the lower portion of Unit IV and i n Unit V, Cl concentrations are depleted relative to seawater an d marked by several local excursions to lower values over intervals o f ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ to a few tens of meters in thickness, which may reflect introduction of freshened water at these depths.  

Contemporary carbonate mineral recrystallization is manifeste d by elevated dissolved Sr concentration in Lithostratigraphic Unit I V shallower than 769 mbsf. Deeper than 769 mbsf, Sr concentratio n decreases monotonically to near constant values in Unit V. The decrease in Sr concentration at the base of Unit IV suggests that carbonate recrystallization is minor and that present-day carbonat e diagenesis is restricted to the top of Unit IV. Sulfate concentratio n increases linearly through the lower part of Unit IV and remains elevated and nearly constant in Unit V. A similar pattern occurs in th e Sr and Mg profiles. Maintaining this gradient likely requires introduction of a sulfate-enriched fluid in the volcaniclastic sediments, likely caused by lateral fluid flow and perhaps in a manner similar t o off-axis hydrothermal flow systems in igneous ocean crust (i.e., Baker et al., 1989; Fisher and Wheat, 2010; Solomon and Kastner, 2012; Vannucchi et al., 2013). A total of 93 samples from Hol e U1520C and 108 samples from Hole U1520D were taken for carbonate analyses. In Units I–III, $C a C O_{3}$ content varies from 2.06 t o $18.4~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . In Units IV–VI, $C a C O_{3}$ content varies from 0.35 to 96. 9 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ , reflecting variations in lithology. The $C a C O_{3}$ profile mimic s the total carbon and inorganic carbon profiles, with similar trend s in all lithostratigraphic units. In the deepest part of Unit IV, $C a C O_{3}$ content ranges from $90.0\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ at 799.0 mbsf to $91.4\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ at 844 mbsf. This high carbonate abundance reflects the presence of pelagic carbonate. In Unit V, peaks in $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content generally reflect localized calcite cement. Organic carbon values are generally low $_{\left(<1.19\right.}$ $\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) throughout the section.  

# Physical properties  

Porosity decreases with depth from $72\%$ at the seafloor to $28\%-$ $38\%$ at $\mathord{\sim}800$ mbsf, with some lower values of ${\sim}40\%$ between 40 an d 106 mbsf that correspond to sand layers. Deeper than 800 mbsf, porosity increases to $56\%$ . Deeper than 855 mbsf, porosity generall y decreases with depth but with substantial scatter to the bottom o f the hole; the lowest porosities in this interval (Lithostratigraphi c Units V and VI) correspond to local (centimeter to tens of centimeters thick) zones of enhanced carbonate and zeolite cementation. The scatter is associated with varying degrees of cementation (Figure F14). Porosity measured on cores is in good agreement wit h LWD density and porosity values.  

$P$ -wave velocity ranges from 1450 to $1800\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ between the seafloor and ${\sim}90$ mbsf. Between 90 and 420 mbsf, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity measurement was mostly unsuccessful because of gaps between core s and liners and expansion cracks. Between 420 and ${\sim}845$ mbsf, velocity generally increases with depth, ranging from 1500 to 270 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ , with little scatter. Deeper than 845 mbsf in volcaniclasti c Lithostratigraphic Units V and VI, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity exhibits significant scatter, ranging from 1800 to ${\sim}5000~\mathrm{m/s}$ . Undrained shea r strength increases with depth from $0{-}10\,\mathrm{kPa}$ at the seafloor to $^{100-}$ $150\,\mathrm{kPa}$ at 150 mbsf and remains constant to 400 mbsf followed by  a rapid increase with depth to ${\sim}600\,\mathrm{kPa}$ at 500 mbsf.  

NGR ranges from ${\sim}0$ to 75 counts/s. Mean values are betwee n 30 and 50 counts/s in all units, except lithostratigraphic Unit IV, where the mean NGR value is $\mathord{\sim}20$ counts/s. Magnetic susceptibilit y is nearly constant with depth in Units I–III and ranges from $20~\times$ $10^{-5}$ to $40\,\times\,10^{-5}$ SI. In Unit IV, magnetic susceptibility increase s with depth from $10\times10^{-5}$ at ${\sim}510$ mbsf to $100\times10^{-5}$ at ${\sim}700$ mbs f and then decreases to ${\sim}4\,\times\,10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}$ at $800{\-}849~\mathrm{mbsf}.$ At the top o f Unit $\mathrm{V}$ at $\mathord{\sim}849$ mbsf, magnetic susceptibility shifts rapidly to ${\sim}100\,\times$ $10^{-5}~\mathrm{SI}$ and then gradually increases with depth to $300\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ a t ${\sim}900$ mbsf, followed by a gradual decrease with depth to $10\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ at ${\sim}1020$ mbsf. At 1045 mbsf, magnetic susceptibility rapidly increases to ${\sim}300\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ .  

Thermal conductivity increases with depth from $1.0\:\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ a t the seafloor to $1.3\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ at $\mathord{\sim}20$ mbsf and remains nearly constant to ${\sim}550$ mbsf. Some higher thermal conductivity values o f $1.6{-}1.9\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ occur between 23 and 87 mbsf and correspond t o sand layers. Measurements were not made between 550 and 64 6 mbsf because the sediments were too indurated for a needle prob e and too fragile and disturbed by coring for the half-space probe. Thermal conductivity increases from ${\sim}1.2\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m{\cdot}K})$ at 648 mbsf t o $1.8~\mathrm{W/(m\cdotK)}$ at 700 mbsf and then remains relatively constant t o ${\sim}850$ mbsf. Deeper than 850 mbsf, thermal conductivity is nearl y constant, with an average of 1.2 W/(m·K).  

# Downhole measurements  

Five APCT-3 formation temperature measurements were combined with thermal conductivity measurements and yielded a hea t flow of $44\,\mathrm{\mW/m^{2}}$ and a temperature gradient of $38^{\circ}C/\mathrm{km}$ . Thi s heat flow value is consistent with heat flow measurements made using a $3.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thermal probe during the R/V Roger Revelle Cruis e RR1508 in the same location (Harris et al., 2016).  

Hole U1520C was logged using a modified triple combo too l string that included borehole diameter from a mechanical calipe r (HLDS), gamma ray (EDTC-B), resistivity (HRLA), and DSI. Th e nuclear source was not mounted on the HLDS. Although some differences exist, wireline logs are generally consistent with LWD dat a collected during Expedition 372 (Figure F13) (see Downhole measurements in the Site U1520 chapter [Barnes et al., $2019\mathrm{c}]$ ). Th e caliper shows that the hole ranges in size from 8 inches (likel y caused by collapse or swelling of clays) to 17 inches. The hole is irregular with many washouts deeper than 780 mbsf. In the uncase d portion of Hole U1520C, gamma ray varies between $\mathord{\sim}20$ and 8 0 gAPI, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity varies between ${\sim}1.6$ and $2.9\;\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ , and resistivity is relatively constant at ${\sim}2~\Omega\mathrm{m}$ , with the exception of stron g peaks between 870 and 890 mbsf. In general, gamma ray and $P$ -wav e velocity are inversely correlated between 640 and 848 mbsf and positively correlated deeper than 848 mbsf. Deeper than 848 mbsf, i n Lithostratigraphic Units $\mathrm{V}$ and VI, $P$ -wave velocity, resistivity, an d gamma ray all exhibit large variations over short (approximatel y meter scale) distances, similar to variations in core-based measurements, but are likely muted because of smoothing associated wit h the large measurement interval for the logs relative to that for discrete core samples.  

# Core-log-seismic integration  

The $P$ -wave velocity data from LWD and wireline logging wer e integrated to develop a velocity model to 944 mbsf. Because densit y data were not recorded during Expedition 375 wireline logging, th e density data from LWD were merged with whole-round track an d discrete sample data to construct a density model. A synthetic seismic reflection trace was developed to tie the LWD, core, and seismi c data (Figure F14). Considering the new seismic tie from this analysis, we defined nine seismic units and compared them with LW D data from Expedition 372 and wireline data and lithostratigraphi c units from Expedition 375.  

Seismic Unit 1 is $106\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and comprises moderate- to lowamplitude, laterally continuous reflections. Cores show the sequence to comprise mud, silt and fine-grained sandy turbidites, an d hemipelagic sediments of Late Pleistocene to Holocene age. Unit  2 is $119\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and is characterized by moderate- to low-amplitude, semicontinuous and chaotic reflections interpreted from seismi c and LWD data to represent the Ruatoria avalanche MTD. In Hol e U1520D, cores were only recovered from the upper $80\,\mathrm{m}$ of the unit, and the base of the unit was not recovered. The lithofacies is composed mostly of interbeds of hemipelagic mud and thin horizonta l silty turbidites with scattered mud intraclasts and erosional bases. The sequence appears largely undisturbed. Units 3–5 consist o f variable amplitude, laterally continuous reflections that can b e traced widely along and across the Hikurangi Trough. Coring reveals that these units are composed of normally graded silty turbidites with thick volcanic ash layers near the top of the unit. Microfossil ages indicate that these are early to Late Pleistocene i n age.  

Seismic Units 6–8 have more irregular geometry than the overlying units and moderate- to low-amplitude reflections locally offse t by small normal faults. The disrupted nature of the reflections i n Unit 6 could be interpreted to be one or more debris flows originating from the flanks of Tūranganui Knoll. Coring reveals that thes e units are composed of marl and calcareous mudstone with tuff an d thin MTDs overlying chalk. Biostratigraphy indicates that thes e units are early Paleocene to early–Middle Pleistocene in age. Unit  9 consists of high-amplitude reflections that are semicontinuous t o discontinuous and corresponds to Lithostratigraphic Units V an d VI, which are composed predominantly of mixed, variably cemented volcaniclastic lithologies, thin intervals of calcareous, siliceous, and organic-rich mudstone, and basalt. The seismic unit s exhibit overall progradational geometry toward the west, buildin g outward into the basin away from the flank of Tūranganui Knoll. Microfossil ages indicate that Unit 9 is late Early Cretaceous to Lat e Cretaceous in age.  

# Site U1526  

# Background and objectives  

The primary drilling objective at Site U1526 was to sample th e thin sediment cover $\left(\sim\!30\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ and ${\sim}100{-}150\;\mathrm{m}$ of underlying volcaniclastics or basement on the western flank of Tūranganui Knoll seamount at $2908\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figures F2, F3; Table T1) (see th e Site U1526 chapter [Wallace et al., 2019]). The scientific aim of coring was to characterize the seamount’s composition, physical properties,  extent  of  alteration  and  hydration,  and  structure  an d hydrogeology prior to transport into the SSE source region. Seismi c imaging shows that subducted seamounts present in the source region of shallow SSEs along the drilling transect (Bell et al., 2010) ar e possible barriers to SSE propagation (Wallace et al., 2016; Figur e F1) and that they may potentially be related to the location of historical tsunami earthquakes (Bell et al., 2014). Priorities for post-expedition core analysis include but are not limited to measuremen t of the mechanical, elastic, frictional, and hydrological properties o f the incoming sediment and basement along with detailed analyse s of composition and alteration.  

# Operations  

Transit to Site U1526  

The vessel arrived at Site U1526 (proposed Site HSM-08 A [Saffer et al., 2017]) at $1700\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{UTC}+12)$ on 22 April 2018.  

# Hole U1526A  

An RCB BHA was assembled, and the drill string was lowered t o the seafloor. Hole U1526A $39^{\circ}1.3203^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}14.7594^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; 2890. 1 mbsl) was spudded at $0150~\mathrm{h}$ on 23 April 2018. Cores 1R–14R advanced from 0 to 83.6 mbsf and recovered $29.26\mathrm{~m~}$ $35\%$ recovery). Nonmagnetic core barrels were used for all RCB cores. At the completion of coring, the drill bit was partially raised from the seafloor, and the ship returned to nearby Site U1520.  

# Hole U1526B  

On 2 May 2018, we returned to Site U1526 following an $^{8\,\mathrm{h}}$ transit from Site U1520 in dynamic positioning mode. The ship was offset $^{20\mathrm{~m~}}$ west-northwest from Hole U1526A, and Hole U1526 B $39^{\circ}1.3146^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , 179°14.7481ʹE; 2888.4 mbsl) was spudded at $2015\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 2 May. APC Cores 1H–4H and XCB Core 5X advanced from 0 t o 33.5 mbsf and recovered $31.56~\mathrm{m}$ $(94\%)$ . Nonmagnetic core barrel s were used for all APC cores. The time spent at Site U1526 was 2.8 8 days.  

The JOIDES Resolution started the transit to Auckland, Ne w Zealand, at $1200~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 May. Expedition 375 ended with the firs t line ashore at the Freyberg Wharf in Auckland at $0652\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 May.  

# Principal results  

# Lithostratigraphy  

We identified two lithostratigraphic units at Site U1526 (Figur e F15). Lithostratigraphic Unit I is a highly condensed section characterized by fine-grained, mixed (i.e., siliciclastic–calcareous) an d biocalcareous sediment. Carbonate content increases progressivel y downsection. Unit I extends from 0 to 30.23 mbsf and is compose d of mud, calcareous mud, and nannofossil-rich ooze. The greenis h gray mud contains foraminifer-rich silt and ash layers. Betwee n 26.91 and 30.23 mbsf, the lithology changes to light green calcareous mud with nannofossils and, across a significant unconformity, to pale brown nannofossil ooze. Unit I ranges in age from Holocen e to Late Cretaceous.  

![](images/f6da5f8f23471a0b04e96b2d620af2faa1a76e58aa7907371fc34e6f510c9f59.jpg)  
Figure F15. Stratigraphic column, Holes U1526A and U1526B.  

The Lithostratigraphic Unit I/II boundary at 30.23 mbsf is characterized by a $20\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick interval rich in manganese concretions. Unit II is Late Cretaceous in age and dominated by volcaniclasti c conglomerate with variably altered basalt clasts in a sand-sized matrix composed of shell and basalt fragments (Figure F15). The top o f the volcaniclastic conglomerate is characterized by abundant intac t shells. Because of the sharp contact between the dramatically different lithofacies and the presence of the manganese crust at the top o f Unit II, we interpret the unit boundary to be an unconformity. Basalt clasts generally range from centimeter to decimeter scale, wit h some intervals extending for $1\mathrm{-}2\textrm{m}$ . The extent of basalt alteratio n is highly variable, and many samples show good preservation of plagioclase and clinopyroxene.  

# Biostratigraphy  

The sedimentary succession cored at Site U1526 ranges in ag e from Holocene to Late Cretaceous (Figure F15). High foraminifera l and nannofossil abundances with moderate to very good preservation were observed throughout the hemipelagic sedimentary cove r (Lithostratigraphic Unit I). Below this interval, in Unit II, volcaniclastic coarse sandstones and conglomerates are barren of microfossils,  although  macroinvertebrate  remains  allow  for  broa d biostratigraphic constraint and paleowater depth reconstruction.  

Planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils indicat e that Hole U1526A recovered a succession of Holocene to Middl e Pleistocene $(0{-}0.63\,\mathrm{\Ma})$ sediments from 0.0 to 19.94 mbsf tha t overly early Pliocene $(4.57{-}5.15\;\mathrm{Ma})$ sediments from 20.46 to 21.0 4 mbsf. The underlying volcaniclastic section recovered in Hol e U1526A (29.1–81.39 mbsf) is generally barren of microfossil remains; however, a coarse sand–sized volcaniclastic sandstone t o conglomerate in the upper portion $(29.1{-}38.8~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) of Lithostratigraphic Unit II contains abundant bivalve shells. Below this interval, large subrounded to subangular pebbles and boulders of variably altered to fresh basalt are embedded in a coarse volcaniclastic san d matrix that contains remobilized shell material, echinoid spines, and coralline algae. Planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils indicate that Hole U1526B recovered Holocene (younge r than $0.011\ M\mathrm{a}$ ) sediments from 0 to 0.06 mbsf, Middle to earl y Pleistocene $(0.53{-}2.17\ \mathrm{Ma})$ sediments from 5.7 to $24.09~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , an d Late Cretaceous $({\sim}66{-}74\;\mathrm{Ma})$ sediments at $30.20\;\mathrm{mbsf}.$  

Planktonic foraminifer abundances and benthic foraminifer assemblages throughout Lithostratigraphic Unit I are indicative o f open oceanic settings and mid- to lower bathyal water depths $>\!600$ m), respectively. Macroinvertebrate remains in Unit II are consistent with Late Cretaceous shallow-water bioclastic material transported downslope.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1526 focused on producing a preliminary magnetostratigraphy for the sedimentary cove r sequence sampled in Hole U1526B, resolving remanence intensit y and demagnetization behavior of volcaniclastic material recovere d deeper than 24 mbsf, providing constraints on the emplacemen t temperatures of the volcaniclastic material, and exploring the possibility that in situ lava flows are present. Analyses included continuous NRM measurement of archive halves prior to and following A F demagnetization. An additional 14 discrete samples from individual basaltic clasts were subjected to thermal demagnetization experiments.  

The pelagic sediments in Hole U1526B yield NRMs in the rang e of ${\sim}0.005$ to $0.5\ \mathrm{A/m}$ that decay rapidly during removal of a stee p drilling overprint. Following AF treatment to 10 or $20~\mathrm{mT}_{x}$ , inclination records display a well-defined pattern with multiple switche s from negative (normal polarity) to positive (reversed polarity) inclinations with sharp transitions.  

The NRM of the volcaniclastic materials in Lithostratigraphi c Unit II ranges from ${\sim}0.2$ to $13.0\,\mathrm{A/m}$ . The NRM directions have inclinations that usually differ among mafic clasts, suggesting that th e clastic material was emplaced at ambient (“cold”) temperatures. Remanent magnetization directions from discrete samples are consistent with the directions measured on archive halves. Sample s generally yield high-quality demagnetization behavior and primarily demagnetize in the blocking temperature range of $250^{\circ}{-}350^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$ suggesting that titanomagnetite or titanomaghemite is the main remanence carrier.  

Basalts recovered between 57.2 and 64.8 mbsf yield consisten t steep and negative NRM inclinations similar to the inclination of  a ${\sim}1.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ long and mostly intact piece of basalt recovered betwee n 24.6 and 26.03 mbsf, which raises the possibility that in situ lav a flows may be present, although heavily fractured, in the sequence.  

# Structural geology  

Bedding planes are difficult to resolve throughout the cored interval at Site U1526, but subhorizontal bedding is recognized in th e upper sedimentary veneer. Fractures and veins are the most common structural features (Figure F16), occur in both clasts and matrix, and locally follow clast/matrix boundaries. Some clasts ar e brecciated, and some are cut by veins that continue into the matrix. Both fracture-filled and diffuse veins are present in the volcaniclastic deposits. We defined two distinct structural domains at this site. Domain 1 contains subhorizontal fine-grained sediments with n o veins. Domain 2 contains volcaniclastic sediments and basalt and i s distinguished by varying degrees of cementation and veining.

# Geochemistry  

The main objective of the inorganic geochemistry program a t Site U1526 was to identify diagenetic reactions and to evaluate th e possibility of vertical recharge of seawater through the Tūranganu i Knoll seamount. A total of 11 routine pore water WR samples wer e collected from APC cores in Hole U1526B and squeezed for shipboard and shore-based pore water chemical analyses. The geochemical profiles at Site U1526 reflect the combined effects of earl y organic matter diagenesis and carbonate/silicate mineral diagenesis. Many solutes exhibit a sharp gradient in their profiles that approaches the volcaniclastic sediments of Lithostratigraphic Unit I I to a modified fluid composition similar to that of the volcaniclasti c unit (Unit V) at Site U1520.  

Hydrocarbon gases were not detected at Site U1526. In Lithostratigraphic Unit I $(0{-}30.23~\mathrm{mbsf})$ , which consists of fine-graine d mixed to biocalcareous sediment, $C a C O_{3}$ content exhibits a larg e degree of scatter (from 1.26 to $69.99\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ). $C a C O_{3}$ content increase s with depth and reaches the highest value $(69.99\,\,\mathrm{wt\%})$ ) in Unit I a t 21 mbsf, which corresponds to a nannofossil-rich ooze. In Unit I I (30.23–81.39 mbsf), which is composed of coarse volcaniclasti c sandstone and volcaniclastic conglomerate, $C a C O_{3}$ content also exhibits a large degree of scatter, ranging from 0.25 to $68.30\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Th e highest value $(68.30\,\,\mathrm{wt\%})$ ) in Unit II is indicative of bivalve shell an d calcite cement incorporation in the shell-rich bed at the top of th e volcaniclastic sequence. Organic carbon content is low in Units  I and II (from 0.00 to $0.61~\mathrm{wt\%}$ ); the highest values occur shallowe r than 21 mbsf and correspond to calcareous mud. C/N ratios rang e from 20.89 to 190.91.  

# Physical properties  

Porosity ranges from $62\%$ to $68\%$ between the seafloor and 2 1 mbsf in Lithostratigraphic Unit I (Figure F16). Porosity decrease s abruptly to $18\%$ at $\mathord{\sim}30$ mbsf at the top of Unit II. From 39 mbsf t o the bottom of Hole U1526A in Unit II, porosity values exhibit larg e scatter $(2\%{-}44\%)$ and average $20\%$ with no significant downhol e trend. In Unit I $\mathrm{(0{-}30\ m b s f)}$ ), $P$ -wave velocity ranges from 1450 t o $1570~\mathrm{m/s}$ . Deeper than 30 mbsf in Unit II, $P$ -wave velocity range s from 1700 to ${\sim}6000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s};$ ; significant scatter arises from the heterogeneous nature of the conglomerates and basalt, due in part to variable degrees of cementation. Thermal conductivity ranges betwee n 1.2 and $1.6~\mathrm{W/(m\cdotK)}$ and has a mean of $1.5\ \mathrm{W/(m\cdotK)}$ . Undraine d shear strength increases with depth, ranging from 0 to ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{kPa}$ between 0 and 30 mbsf. NGR in Unit I mostly ranges between 20 an d 40 counts/s, except for lower values of 2–8 counts/s between 27 an d 30 mbsf, where nannofossil-rich ooze is present. NGR in Unit II increases from $\mathrm{{\sim}}29$ counts/s at the top of the unit to ${\sim}36$ counts/s a t ${\sim}50$ mbsf and then decreases gradually to 27 counts/s at the botto m of the cored interval. Magnetic susceptibility mostly ranges from 1 0 $\times\,10^{-5}$ to $200\times10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}$ in Unit I, shallower than ${\sim}30$ mbsf. Deepe r than ${\sim}30$ mbsf, magnetic susceptibility ranges from $\sim\!100\times10^{-5}$ t o $3000\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}_{\mathrm{z}}$ , with an average of ${\sim}1400\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ .  

# Core-seismic integration  

Core-based observations and measurements in Holes U1526 A and U1526B were integrated with seismic reflection data fro m Tūranganui Knoll. In the absence of logging data, we used $P$ -wav e velocity and density data from cores to construct a lithologic mode l and produce a seismic-well tie (Figure F16). $P$ -wave velocity dat a from the Hole U1526B pelagic sediments indicate that velocity i n this interval is low, typically ranging from $\mathord{\sim}1500$ to $1530\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , whic h is consistent with a strong reflection at the base of Lithostratigraphic Unit I that separates the pelagic sediments from cemente d volcaniclastic sandstones below. To depth convert the seismic dat a below Unit I, we used a mean $P$ -wave velocity value of $3805~\mathrm{m/s}$ from core data.  

Two seismic units were identified at Site U1526. Seismic Unit  1 corresponds to Lithostratigraphic Unit I and is represented by  a $30.2\textrm{m}$ thick weakly reflective interval in Hole U1526B. However, the thickness varies significantly away from the site, reaching ${>}140$ m elsewhere on Tūranganui Knoll. Cores show that Unit 1 (0–30. 2 mbsf) comprises hemipelagic mud, light greenish gray calcareou s mud, and brownish white nannofossil-rich ooze with thin layers o f volcanic ash. Unit 2 corresponds to Unit II and represents the lowe r $44\;\mathrm{m}$ drilled in Hole U1526A but extends below the depth of drilling. The upper part of the unit is strongly reflective, comprising planar to irregular, discontinuous high-amplitude reflections. Core s show that Unit 2 comprises large, subrounded to subangular pebbles and boulders of variably altered to fresh basalt embedded in  a matrix of cemented volcaniclastic sand.  

and the $10\%$ inch casing was lowered behind an underreamer, mu d motor, and drill bit, with the ACORK head attached to the top of th e casing. At both sites, an HRT was used to release the ACORK assembly after it was drilled in.  

A flatpack umbilical containing three hydraulic lines $?\!_{4}$ inch diameter) was strapped to the outside of the $10\%$ inch casing as it wa s assembled and run through the moonpool. These lines terminate i n casing screens in the target monitoring intervals at depth and ar e connected to valves and the pressure sensing unit at the ACOR K head. Pressure monitoring at Site U1518 takes place in the hangin g wall (217.7 mbsf), fault zone $(332.1\,\mathrm{\mbsf})$ , and footwall (393. 2 mbsf) of the Pāpaku fault. Pressure monitoring takes place in tw o intervals at Site U1519 (at 124 and $264\,\mathrm{mbsf}$ ). After the ACORK wa s seated, the CORK-II was lowered into the inner bore of the $10\%$ inch ACORK casing and latched into the ACORK head after lowering and landing the instrument string into the CORK-II.  

Temperature sensors were attached to a rope (7⁄16 inch Spectr a line) with sinker bars at various depths to hold the rope taut (Figur e F4). A total of 30 temperature sensors were installed at Site U1518, with dense spacing spanning the fault zone and coarser spacing i n the hanging wall and footwall. The instrument string at Site U151 9 consists of 15 temperature sensors. Both instrument strings wer e lowered through the drill pipe into the inner bore of the $4\%$ inc h casing and seated with a landing plug at the CORK-II head. The OsmoSamplers and OsmoFlowmeter were lowered as part of the temperature string at Site U1518 (Figure F4) and were landed in  a titanium seat inside the CORK-II casing that was positioned in th e fault zone interval. Screened, perforated casing (7 m high) at th e fault zone monitoring interval allows flow of formation fluids int o the OsmoSampler package that monitors fluid flow rates and continuously samples formation fluid for geochemical characterization.  

# Observatory installations  

Borehole observatories were installed at Sites U1518 and U1519. The observatory at Site U1518 (penetrating the Pāpaku fault) includes three levels of pore pressure monitoring, high-resolutio n temperature monitoring at 30 separate depths, a fluid flowmeter, and time-series fluid sampling for geochemical analyses (Figure F4) . The observatory at Site U1519 is similar in overall design (as described below) but includes only two pore pressure monitoring intervals and temperature monitoring at 15 separate depths, with n o fluid sampling (Figure F4). Pore pressure monitoring is conducte d through hydraulic tubing that terminates in screens outside of th e casing, except in the fault zone interval at Site U1518, where th e casing is perforated for geochemical sampling. The fluid sampling i s conducted using osmotic pumps connected to sampling coils (Jannasch et al., 2004). Temperature monitoring is conducted using autonomous temperature sensors suspended in the interior of th e casing and within the OsmoSampler package at Site U1518.  

Both observatories consist of an outer $10\%$ inch casing strin g with an ACORK head and a $4\%$ inch inner casing string with  a CORK-II head placed inside the ACORK (Figure F4). For the faul t site, Hole U1518G was predrilled to 433 mbsf, and the intention wa s to lower $10\%$ inch casing into the hole escorted by an underreamer, mud motor, and drill bit, with the ACORK head attached to the to p of the casing. During reentry, however, unanticipated heave cause d the bit to knock the reentry funnel away from Hole U1518G, requiring us to drill in the ACORK and casing at the new location of th e funnel and mud skirt (Hole U1518H; drilled to 426 mbsf). For th e Site U1519 observatory, Hole U1519B was predrilled to 283 mbsf,  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

All of our primary objectives were successfully achieved durin g Expeditions 372 and 375:  

• Acquiring LWD data to characterize geophysical properties at three sites spanning from the subducting Pacific plate through to the upper slope overlying a region of large slow slip; • Installing two subseafloor observatories to monitor deformation and characterize changes in thermal, hydrological, and chemical state during multiple SSE cycles; and • Coring at four sites to characterize the physical conditions and rock properties that underlie SSE occurrence.  

Overall, the LWD aims achieved during Expedition 372 wer e reasonably successful, considering that the expedition lost significant time because of weather events and an operational delay prio r to departing Australia that was related to biosecurity requirement s in New Zealand waters. Target LWD depths were reached at bot h Sites U1518 (600 mbsf) and U1519 (650 mbsf; Table T1). At Sit e U1520 in the Hikurangi Trough, LWD reached $750\mathrm{~m~}$ of the total planned depth of 1200 mbsf.  

Because of mostly excellent weather and smooth operations, w e were able to complete an ambitious slate of planned drilling activities during Expedition 375, including wireline logging the lowe r portion of Site U1520. Together, Expeditions 372 and 375 implemented a complex, linked data-sharing and sampling plan tha t spanned two expeditions, several shore-based investigators, and  a high volume of sample requests for mission-critical post-expeditio n studies of rock properties, composition, structures, and deformation. This plan was largely successful because of the careful coordination of sample requests and sampling strategies during the severa l months prior to the two expeditions.  

# Logging while drilling  

A range of LWD tools were successfully deployed at Site s U1518–U1520 during Expedition 372. These tools included th e geoVISION (electrical imaging); the NeoScope (propagation resistivity and neutron porosity); the SonicScope (compressional, shear, and Stoneley wave slowness); the TeleScope (measurement-whiledrilling data); and the proVISION Plus (NMR). The LWD data wer e collected to  

• Monitor in real time for gas entering the borehole or formation overpressures,   
• Facilitate lithologic interpretation,   
• Guide interpretation of faults and fractures,   
• Determine the maximum and minimum horizontal stress directions,   
• Estimate hydrate saturation,   
• Constrain elastic moduli for integration with seismic data, and   
• Provide guidance for selection of monitoring intervals for the observatories installed during Expedition 375.  

The downhole measurement plan for Expedition 372 also include d deployment of the StethoScope tool to determine formation pressure and fluid mobility (a measure of permeability) by inserting  a probe into the formation wall at selected depths. This tool ha d never been deployed by IODP, although a similar wireline measurement was made using the Modular Formation Dynamics Teste r during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 319 (Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010; Saffer et al., 2013). During Expedition 372, the StethoScope was deployed at Site U1518 six times at two stations but failed to record pressure measurements because of a lac k of mud seal at the borehole wall.  

We drilled two holes (U1518A and U1518B) through the Pāpak u fault because bad weather interrupted operations in Hole U1518A. Hole U1518B produced excellent quality logging data. We successfully drilled to the target depth of 600 mbsf, and interpretation o f the LWD data indicates that we penetrated the fault zone at $\sim\!320$ mbsf. The logs reveal a sequence above the fault with different physical properties than those below (Figure F6). In addition, changes i n seismic reflection character in the drilled interval are correlate d with variations in logging parameters with depth. The logging dat a provide detailed insights into the likely lithologies in the borehol e and physical properties that reveal deformation, bedding attitude, stress state, and elastic properties. We successfully identified th e distribution and density of fractures visible in borehole images an d associated structures that can be inferred from bedding dips. Thes e data will help to constrain kinematic models of thrust and fold development. We also observed borehole breakouts oriented approximately north–south, suggesting an east–west-oriented maximu m horizontal stress. Another important success at Site U1518 was th e successful collection of continuous high-resolution data to aid in selecting depth targets for the borehole observatory installatio n during Expedition 375.  

The primary objective at Site U1519, in the upper margin slop e basin, was to log to 650 mbsf to help characterize the nature of th e sedimentary sequences before a planned borehole observatory installation during Expedition 375. We successfully acquired generall y high quality logging data to the target depth. We found an excellen t correlation between changes in logging parameters and three majo r sedimentary sequences that were interpreted on seismic reflectio n profiles prior to drilling (Figure F9). In addition, a remarkably goo d match occurs between subunits recognized in the logs and comple x subunits that were inferred to correspond to changes in lithology i n the seismic data. Shipboard analysis indicates that the logs provid e information on bedding thicknesses and dips, fracture orientations, and density. The lower part of the borehole successfully penetrate d a westward-dipping sedimentary sequence beneath the seafloo r that lies on the landward (back limb) side of an apparently inactiv e thrust fault. Borehole breakouts in the lower part of the hole are oriented northeast–southwest, suggesting an approximately margi n normal–directed maximum horizontal stress. Logging properties, such as compressional and shear wave velocity and density data, will improve analysis of seismic refection data away from the borehole. Similar to Site U1518, collection of continuous high-resolution dat a was of great value toward selecting depth targets for the borehol e observatory installation at this site.  

We drilled two holes (U1520A and U1520B) in the subductio n inputs sequence in the Hikurangi Trough because bad weather interrupted operations while drilling Hole U1520A (Table T1). Hol e U1520B reached a total depth of 750 mbsf and was then abandone d to undertake other work at Site U1517. Consequently, we did no t reach our predrilling objective of drilling through the oldest sedimentary sequences and penetrating the inferred volcanic rocks corresponding to the lower flank of Tūranganui Knoll. Acquisition o f LWD data to 750 mbsf, however, provided Expedition 375 with ke y operational flexibility when returning to the site for coring. Becaus e the turn-around time for shore-based processing of LWD data wa s typically ${\sim}3$ days and this site was drilled close to the end of the expedition, our shipboard interpretations for this site are based o n some unprocessed LWD data. The LWD logs at Site U1520 reveal numerous changes in physical properties downhole that matc h boundaries in the depth-converted seismic reflection data (Figur e F12). As at the other sites, we found that changes in borehole conditions revealed by the ultrasonic caliper and other logging propertie s such as density, resistivity, porosity, and gamma ray coincide wit h changes in seismic reflection amplitudes and packages of seismi c stratigraphy. In the upper and middle reaches of the borehole, w e drilled through sequences we infer to be predominantly turbidite s and the distal reaches of the Ruatoria MTD. Cores acquired durin g Expedition 375 confirmed that LWD data were acquired beneat h the base of the Hikurangi Trough clastic sequence and into the inferred pelagic cover sequence of the Hikurangi Plateau.  

# Observatory installations  

Both of the complex, nested observatory installations were completed successfully. Each of the installations required a carefully coordinated sequence of  operations,  including several  reentries, running and releasing multiple nested casing strings in deep water, and rigging large instrument strings, lengthy rope, and several hundred meters of hydraulic umbilical (see Operations in the Sit e U1518 chapter and Operations in the Site U1519 chapter [Saffer e t al., 2019; Barnes et al., 2019b]). At Site U1518, the observatory included monitoring fluid pressure at three separate intervals an d fluid sampling in the interior of the casing through a complex holecompletion design (Figure F4). At Site U1519, the observatory design was somewhat simpler but also included multiple nested casin g strings and installation of an instrument string. We attribute th e overall success of both observatory installations to a combination o f extensive pre-expedition preparation and to a carefully planned operations strategy for casing installation and instrument handling a t the rig floor and moonpool. The design phase of the observatorie s began in collaboration with Texas A&M University (USA) engineering staff in April 2015 ( ${\sim}35\$ months in advance of Expedition 375). This preparation time was enabled by funding of the observator y development well in advance of the expedition and was essential t o design and fabricate the observatory systems and to develop the implementation strategy.  

Observatory operations generally went smoothly and, in som e cases, more quickly than anticipated (e.g., running casing whil e strapping umbilical took less time than allotted in initial time estimates). However, a few minor problems were encountered durin g deployment that may compromise the observatory integrity at eac h site. At Site U1518, unexpected heave during reentry in the predrilled hole (U1518G) caused the drill pipe to bump and displac e the reentry cone. As a result, we had no viable option other than t o drill-in the ACORK system to its total depth of 423 mbsf at a ne w location (Hole U1518H) a few meters away from the previousl y drilled hole. Although it was fortunate that we were prepared t o drill with a mud motor and underreamer, the proximity of a larg e open hole very near to the observatory installation raises two possibilities: (1) an extended time period may be required for the environment around the observatory borehole to reach thermal an d chemical equilibrium and (2) hydraulic isolation from the seafloo r may be compromised. However, we anticipate that this deep, largediameter open hole will have collapsed soon after abandonment; initial download of the pressure data from the observatory will allow us to assess this. Because the casing string was drilled-in rathe r than lowered into a predrilled hole, it is also possible that the umbilical was damaged during installation and/or that the casing screen s were fouled by circulation of a large volume of cuttings during drilling of the large-diameter hole. An additional potential issue at Sit e U1518 arose because the ROV platform (deployed by free-fall) hun g up on the top of the ACORK wellhead. For this reason, we electe d not to install an ROV platform at Site U1519.  

At Site U1519, postinstallation inspection of the ACORK an d CORK-II wellheads by the subsea camera revealed that the reentr y funnel had filled with cuttings that partly bury the ACORK bays an d the lower portion of the pressure sensor package. Potential futur e replacement of the sensor package, which is designed to be modular, will require removal of the cuttings before the sensor packag e can be replaced. The inspection also revealed that one of the support fins on the CORK-II wellhead was slightly damaged, likel y during release using the J-tool. In general, these issues were unavoidable. However, based on these experiences, modification of installation operations may warrant consideration, for example, (1) t o minimize the risk of large cuttings loads filling the ACORK reentr y funnel, (2) to more reliably release wellheads without requiring dril l string rotation (e.g., by using a hydraulic release as was used for th e ACORK), and (3) to redesign the ACORK wellhead profile to minimize risk of ROV platform or other free-fall components becomin g misaligned.  

# Coring and sampling  

At all of our coring sites (U1518–U1520 and U1526), the primary drilling and sampling objectives were met. At Site U1518, th e formation was highly overconsolidated at the seafloor, and as a result we were unable to drill with the APC/XCB systems as deeply a s planned and switched to RCB coring at a relatively shallow dept h $(<\!200\,\mathrm{\mbsf})$ to drill across the thrust fault. At Site U1520 (Hol e  

U1520C), we used a drill-in reentry system to case the upper portion of the sediment section; this system worked as planned and allowed us to reach our depth target in the volcaniclastic sequence. The original planned depth of the hole was 1200 mbsf, but the total depth was shallower because we had reached our main scientific objective. At Site U1526, we initially elected to undertake RCB corin g in Hole U1526A because the primary target was the volcaniclasti c and basaltic sequences of the seamount. However, sufficient tim e became available after completing operations at Site U1520 (nea r the end of the expedition) that we were able to return to Site U152 6 to obtain a nearly complete section of the sedimentary sequenc e overlying the seamount in Hole U1526B with APC coring. At Sit e U1519, a highly targeted coring strategy was undertaken to maximize our efficiency with limited time. Here, we opted to spot cor e with the RCB system to collect material only from depths corresponding to the screened intervals of the observatory and in th e lower part of the section where wellbore failures (breakouts) wer e observed in LWD data. Two more APC/HLAPC holes targete d shallow temperature and fluid chemistry measurements at Sit e U1519. This targeted approach yielded the key data needed to mee t expedition science objectives.  

The suite of cores obtained at Sites U1520 and U1526 reveal  a surprising diversity of lithologies entering the subduction zone, including clastic trench fill material, carbonate-rich pelagic sediments,  and  a  thick  volcaniclastic  sequence.  Post-expeditio n research focused on the composition, diagenetic state, and physical properties of these lithologies will reveal the role that they play i n SSE occurrence. Of particular interest are the extensive volcaniclastic deposits found in the lower portions of Sites U1520 and U1526; the alteration and diagenetic products of these materials ma y strongly influence the frictional properties and fluid content in th e SSE source region. Correlating the lithologic sequences from Site s U1520 and U1526 into regional seismic data will provide importan t insight into the dominant lithologies in the SSE source region an d their along-strike variations. Changes in pore water geochemistr y observed throughout the Site U1520 section suggest evidence fo r recent fluid flow in lithologies recovered from the lower half. Flui d geochemistry also shows changes due to rapid sedimentation event s in the upper, clastic portion of Site U1520.  

At Site U1518, coring across an active shallow thrust fault provided new insights into the fault architecture, small-scale structural features, physical properties, and pore fluid geochemistry of an active fault that may be involved in SSEs. Post-expedition investigations will illuminate the hydrological and mechanical behavior o f this active fault, particularly investigations related to fault structur e and microstructures; analysis of pore fluid geochemistry variation s across the fault; and laboratory studies of fault and wall rock friction, strength, and hydrological properties. These studies will als o strongly complement the insights gained from the observatory samples and data (see above).  

Drilling at Site U1519 aimed to characterize the upper plat e physical and mechanical properties and thermal state. The approach of targeted spot coring was successful in obtaining sample s needed to robustly interpret observatory pressure and temperatur e data and to extract quantitative information about in situ stres s state from wellbore breakouts deeper than $\mathord{\sim}590$ mbsf. Temperatur e measurements in the APC hole were also successful and provid e valuable constraints for models that will define the thermal structure of the subduction zone and the temperature regime of the SS E source region.  

Although the Expedition 375 priorities were focused on slo w slip at subduction zones, we also recovered material that will giv e new insights into a range of other processes. Tephra layers, sometimes as thick as $1.5\;\mathrm{m},$ , were encountered throughout Sites U1518– U1520. These layers provide a nearly complete and continuous record of volcanic events at the Hikurangi subduction zone since th e inception of subduction at the Hikurangi-Kermadec-Tonga Trench. Post-expedition research on the tephra will reveal changes in th e magnitude, frequency, and source of arc volcanism. Pre-expeditio n interpretation of seismic reflection images suggested that Sit e U1520 would intersect the distal portions of the $\sim\!3150\;\mathrm{km}^{3}$ Ruatoria debris avalanche deposit (Collot et al., 2001). However, evidenc e of mass transport processes in cores recovered from this unit i s equivocal; further investigation is needed to determine if Site U152 0 did indeed intersect the Ruatoria debris avalanche deposit. If so, th e cores may provide important insights into processes associated wit h the emplacement of this massive debris avalanche deposit. Dating o f basaltic material and detailed biostratigraphic and sedimentologica l investigation of sedimentary sequences recovered from Site U152 6 will yield improved constraints on Hikurangi Plateau development, including its vertical tectonic history.
