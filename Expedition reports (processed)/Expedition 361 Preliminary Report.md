# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 36 1 drilled six sites on the southeast African margin and in the IndianAtlantic ocean gateway, southwest Indian Ocean, from 30 Januar y to 31 March 2016. In total, $5175\mathrm{~m~}$ of core was recovered, with a n average recovery of $102\%$ , during 29.7 days of on-site operations. The sites, situated in the Mozambique Channel at locations directl y influenced by discharge from the Zambezi and Limpopo Rive r catchments, the Natal Valley, the Agulhas Plateau, and Cape Basin, were targeted to reconstruct the history of the greater Agulhas Current system over the past ${\sim}5~\mathrm{my}$ . The Agulhas Current is the strongest western boundary current in the Southern Hemisphere, transporting some $70~\mathrm{{Sv}}$ of warm, saline surface water from th e tropical Indian Ocean along the East African margin to the tip o f Africa. Exchanges of heat and moisture with the atmosphere influence southern African climates, including individual weather systems such as extratropical cyclone formation in the region an d rainfall patterns. Recent ocean model and paleoceanographic dat a further point at a potential role of the Agulhas Current in controlling the strength and mode of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during the Late Pleistocene. Spillage o f saline Agulhas water into the South Atlantic stimulates buoyanc y anomalies that act as control mechanisms on the basin-wid e AMOC, with implications for convective activity in the North Atlantic and global climate change. The main objectives of the expedition were to establish the sensitivity of the Agulhas Current t o climatic changes during the Pliocene–Pleistocene, to determine th e dynamics of the Indian-Atlantic gateway circulation during thi s time, to examine the connection of the Agulhas leakage an d AMOC, and to address the influence of the Agulhas Current on African terrestrial climates and coincidences with human evolution. Additionally, the expedition set out to fulfill the needs of the Ancillary Project Letter, consisting of high-resolution interstitial wate r samples that will constrain the temperature and salinity profiles o f the ocean during the Last Glacial Maximum.  

The expedition made major strides toward fulfilling each o f these objectives. The recovered sequences allowed generation o f complete spliced stratigraphic sections that span from 0 to betwee n ${\sim}0.13$ and 7 Ma. This sediment will provide decadal- to millennialscale climatic records that will allow answering the paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic questions set out in the drilling proposal.  

# Introduction  

The Agulhas Current of the South Indian Ocean is a fundamental part of the South Indian Ocean subtropical gyre circulation an d constitutes the strongest western boundary current in the Souther n Hemisphere oceans (Lutjeharms, 2006a) transporting ${\sim}70$ Sv (1 S v $=10^{6}\;\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{s})$ of warm, saline tropical surface waters to the tip of Africa (Figure F1, F2). This volume transport is roughly twice that o f the Gulf Steam in the North Atlantic (Cunningham et al., 2007), bu t like its northern counterpart the Agulhas Current fosters exchange s of heat and moisture with the atmosphere that influence regiona l climates and weather systems (Reason and Mulenga, 1999). A portion of the Agulhas waters invade the South Atlantic through th e Agulhas rings (Arhan et al., 2011) that transport between 5–20 Sv o f warm, saline water from the Indian Ocean to the South Atlantic— the so-called interocean “warm-water route” of the global oceani c thermohaline circulation (THC). Ocean models and paleoceanographic data strongly suggest that the “leakage” of saline Agulha s water into the South Atlantic stimulates regional buoyancy anomalies that ultimately impact convective activity in the northern Nort h Atlantic, plausibly acting as a contributor to the basin-wide Atlanti c Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) (Figure F1) (Weijer , 2000; Weijer et al., 2002; Knorr and Lohmann, 2003; Van Sebille e t al., 2009; Biastoch et al., 2008, 2009a). The numerical simulation s specifically point to Agulhas leakage as a potential modulator of th e AMOC and a rheostat for the ventilation of the deep ocean. Henc e the significance of the Agulhas Current is threefold:  

The Agulhas Current is a significant component of the globa l THC; it carries surface water into the Atlantic that compensates fo r the export of deep water from the Atlantic Basin to the world ocean;  

This Agulhas leakage transfer of salt to the South Atlantic variably impacts the buoyancy structure there and may contribute t o mode changes and variability of the AMOC and thus climate variability in the North Atlantic region; and  

Variations in Agulhas warm-water transports along the southeast African continental margin drive interannual variability connected with the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) mode with implication s for southern Africa regional climate and weather systems.  

Interest in the long-term evolution of ocean circulation of f southern Africa, on Pliocene–Pleistocene timescales, has concentrated in the past on the Atlantic side of the continent. Deep Se a Drilling Project (DSDP) Legs 40 and 75 in 1974 and 1980 and Ocea n Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 108 and 114 in 1985 and 1987 targeted the southwest African continental slope and rise north an d south of Walvis Ridge in order to explore marine conditions durin g the opening of the South Atlantic, including the origin and paleoceanographic history of the Eastern Walvis Ridge and carbonat e dissolution cycles. More recently, ODP Leg 175 in 1997 targeted th e southeastern Atlantic margin between $5^{\circ}$ and $32^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ to assess the history of the Benguela Current and upwelling off Angola and Namibia. ODP Leg 208 in 2003 drilled a transect of six sites on Walvi s Ridge to gain insight into paleoceanographic events such as the Paleocene/Eocene hyperthermals and the early Oligocene Oi1 col d event.  

By contrast, the eastern continental margin off southern Afric a is poorly represented in the database of scientific drill sites. Prior t o International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 361, only one site, DSDP Leg 25 Site 244, has been drilled within the direct reaches of the South Indian western boundary current. The sit e is positioned on Davie Ridge, at the northern entrance of the Mozambique Channel, and was occupied during Leg 25 in 1972 (Simpson, Schlich, et al., 1974) to provide data on the structure an d geological history of the East African margin and western Madagascar.  

Expedition 361 fills this scientific/geographic gap by drilling targets in three sectors of the greater Agulhas Current system (Figur e F3):  

1. The northern sector in the Mozambique Channel that provides the source waters for the Agulhas Current;   
2. The central sector in the confluence region where the southwestern extension of the East Madagascar Current converges with the Mozambique Channel throughflow to form the Agulhas Current; and   
3. The southern sector in the Indian-Atlantic ocean gateway at the tip of Africa with Agulhas retroflection, Agulhas Return Current, and Agulhas leakage.  

Analysis of these sediments will help to address the scientific objectives outlined below.  

# Background Motivation for drilling in the greater Agulhas Current system  

The Agulhas Current system—modern oceanographic circulation  

The Agulhas Current constitutes the largest ocean wester n boundary jet current in the Southern Hemisphere. This current i s involved in the warm-water return flow that feeds the renewal o f North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and is a key component of th e global oceanic thermohaline “conveyor belt” circulation (Gordon, 1986; Weijer et al., 1999; Lutjeharms, 2006a). The Agulhas Curren t carries thermocline waters from the South Indian subtropical gyr e with contributions of Red Sea and Arabian Sea Waters and from th e Indonesian Throughflow (Lutjeharms, 2006a) (Figure F4). Drive n by the anticyclonic wind field over the South Indian Ocean, thes e water types are advected through eddies and meanders from th e equatorial Indian Ocean through the Mozambique Channel and th e East Madagascar Current (EMC) (Song et al., 2004; Beal et al., 2006). Interaction between Madagascar and westward-travelin g Rossby waves from the tropical Indian Ocean contribute to the formation of eddies (Schouten et al., 2002a) east of Madagascar (Biastoch and Krauss, 1999). Four to five of these eddies, as wide as 35 0 km, drift southward through the Mozambique Channel per year, carrying a mean transport of 17 Sv (Ridderinkhof et al., 2010), imposing short-term modulation over the whole depth range an d width of the channel (de Ruijter et al., 2002) and imparting an interannual variability of ${\sim}9$ Sv into the Agulhas Current (Biastoch et al., 2009a). A coupled ocean (sea-surface temperature [SST])–atmosphere oscillator in the tropical Indian Ocean, the IOD, provide s important upstream forcing of the Agulhas Current (Ridderinkho f et al., 2010). The EMC has an estimated transport of $20\:S\mathbf{v}$ (Donohue et al., 2003; Schott et al., 1988), increasing to 35 Sv at the southern tip of Madagascar (Nauw et al., 2008). At the latitude of Durba n $(30^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ , the westward-flowing southern extension of the EMC converges with the southward-flowing train of Mozambique Channe l eddies to form the Agulhas Current as a narrow jet-type curren t that is steered by the steep South African continental margin. By th e time it passes $32^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , the Agulhas Current carries ${\sim}70$ Sv of war m $(24^{\circ}{-}17^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and saline (35.5–35.2) (Gordon et al., 1990, 1992; Bea l and Bryden, 1999; Bryden and Beal, 2001) waters of the South Indian thermocline (Bryden et al., 2005). In its deeper reaches, th e current also includes saline Red Sea Water (Gordon et al., 1987) an d other waters derived from far-distant sources in the Pacific (Gordo n and Fine, 1996; Speich et al., 2002).  

The Agulhas Current’s mean trajectory is steered by the bathymetry of the narrow southeast African shelf where its steep continental slope provides for maximum barotropic and baroclini c guidance (de Ruijter et al., 1999b; Lutjeharms and de Ruijter, 1996; Goschen and Schuman, 1990). Instabilities of the current are cause d by the downstream migration of eddies and meanders that interac t with the bathymetry and morphology of the continental margin. A n example is solitary meanders that form in the Natal Bight, the socalled Natal Pulses (Figure F5) (e.g., Lutjeharms and Roberts, 1988; Beal and Bryden, 1999; de Ruijter et al., 1999b; van Leeuwen et al., 2000; Bryden et al., 2005; Biastoch et al., 2008; Tsugawa and Hasumi, 2010; Rouault and Penven, 2011). At the tip of Africa, the current turns west, driven by its own inertia, and retroflects back to th e east into the Indian Ocean as the Agulhas Return Current (Lutjeharms and Ballegooyen, 1988). Mozambique Channel and EMC eddies that propagate downstream with the Agulhas Current a s strongly barotropic solitary meanders (Bryden et al., 2005; Biastoc h et al., $2009{\mathrm{a}}$ ; Tsugawa and Hasumi, 2010) destabilize the retroflection to the extent that four to six up to $400~\mathrm{km}$ wide anticycloni c eddies (Agulhas rings) form per year and spin off the retroflectio n area carrying between 2 and 20 Sv of thermocline water to th e South Atlantic (de Ruijter et al., $1999\mathbf{a}$ ; Richardson, 2007). Some researchers have suggested that Agulhas leakage is linked with interannual modes of Indian and Pacific variability, thus proposing  a connection with the IOD and Pacific La Niña/El Niño phase s (Schouten et al., 2002b; Palastanga et al., 2006).  

# Agulhas leakage and the AMOC  

The dynamics of the Agulhas leakage and its possible impact o n the AMOC and global climate have been explored in a number o f ocean and climate models. These studies suggest that (1) this exchange affects the buoyancy of Atlantic thermocline waters, potentially influencing NADW formation on multidecadal timescale s (Weijer et al., 2002; Knorr and Lohmann, 2003; Biastoch et al., 2009a) and (2) perturbations of planetary waves by mesoscale eddies influence decadal variability of the AMOC (Van Sebille and va n Leeuwen, 2007; Biastoch et al., 2008).  

Saltwater entering the South Atlantic with Agulhas rings stimulates planetary (Kelvin and Rossby) waves that propagate across th e Atlantic Basin and perturb the AMOC (Biastoch et al., 2009a). Short-term variability that appears to be associated with Agulha s leakage is observed in the subtropical North Atlantic (de Ruijter e t al., 1999a), whereas some of the interannual to decadal AMOC variability seen in the models plausibly stems from the frequency o f Agulhas ring shedding that, in turn, is modulated by the IOD and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modes (de Ruijter et al., 1999a; Gordon and Haxby, 1990). The basin-scale radiation of planetar y waves triggered by Agulhas leakage hence constitutes a “fast-response” mechanism that operates on interannual to decadal timescales.  

The advection of saltwater from the Agulhas region to the convection centers in the North Atlantic Ocean is the likely connectio n between the AMOC response and Agulhas leakage. Seeding numerical Lagrangian floats into the Agulhas retroflection area in highresolution ocean general circulation models reveals an advectiv e transit time of 30–40 y from the Agulhas Current to the North Atlantic (van Sebille et al., 2010). These time estimates are also consistent with those obtained with lower-resolution models (Weijer, 2000). Continuing heat exchange with the overlying atmospher e augments the density anomaly associated with leaked Agulhas saltwater parcels as they drift northward (Weijer, 2000; Haarsma et al., 2011). Agulhas leakage therefore stimulates an AMOC respons e with a time delay dictated by the advective timescale for the exces s salt to reach the North Atlantic, whereas the new AMOC equilibrium state is achieved several hundred years later when buoyanc y fluxes and mixing are in balance (Weijer, 2000; Hughes et al., 2009). Establishing the impact of wind forcing on Agulhas leakage and it s subsequent effect on the AMOC is not straightforward because th e strength and position of the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitud e westerlies may affect the Agulhas leakage and AMOC simultaneously (Biastoch et al., 2009b; Toggweiler and Samuels, 1995; Sijp an d England, 2008), perhaps by shifting the position of the Subtropical Front (STF) south of Africa. The STF is thought by some to defin e the width of the Agulhas leakage corridor, hence the strength of th e leakage, although recent modeling studies show a stronger dynami c relationship with the intensity of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies (Durgadoo et al., 2013). Nonetheless, the westerlies control th e northward Ekman transport in the Southern Ocean, which force s deep water to ascend to the upper ocean, conceivably “pulling” th e deep branch of the AMOC (Toggweiler and Samuels, 1995; Visbeck, 2007). Through their influence on deep-water upwelling an d AMOC strength, the westerly winds and Agulhas buoyancy fluxe s likely play important roles in the regulation of the ocean’s ability t o store carbon (Watson and Garabato, 2006; Backeberg et al., 2012), which posits a further plausible link between Agulhas leakage an d global climate variability.  

# Paleoceanography of the Agulhas Current system  

The Agulhas Current region is an area in which retrieval o f high-quality sediment cores is difficult. The southeast African margin has a very narrow shelf and a steep continental slope, leading t o frequent sediment instability and slumping. Further, the vigorou s Agulhas Current and its mesoscale variability can cause sedimen t redistribution because meanders and eddies frequently reach th e seafloor. Yet, a number of published studies and emerging wor k demonstrate that paleoceanographic records of excellent quality ar e in fact achievable for reconstructing both surface and deep-wate r variability in the region. A full synthesis of the paleoceanographi c evidence is yet to emerge, but there appears to be several aspects o f the Agulhas paleotime series about which different workers are i n broad agreement. Based on published records, Agulhas leakage ha s been a persistent feature of the past $1.3\;\mathrm{my},$ with less leakage durin g full glacial times than interglacial times and greatest leakage at th e glacial terminations (Peeters et al., $2004;$ Caley et al., 2012; Petrick e t al., 2015). There is also general agreement about evidence for  a more northerly position of the STF during glacial times (Rau et al., 2002, 2006; Bard and Rickaby, 2009; Martínez-Méndez et al., 2010), and some suggestion that this may play a role in reducing Agulha s leakage. However, there is also evidence that the positions of th e westerly wind belt and STF can be decoupled (Graham and De Boer, 2013; De Boer et al., 2013; Durgadoo et al., 2013), leading to som e uncertainty in the exact mechanisms of changing Agulhas leakage.  

At the tip of Africa, a spliced record composed of Cores GeoB3603-2 and MD96-2081 (termed the Cape Basin Record [CBR]; Peeters et al., 2004) shows maximum abundance of the so-calle d “Agulhas leakage fauna” (ALF) that appears to be related to minim a in precession (maxima in northern summer insolation), leadin g these authors to suggest a possible teleconnection to the monsoo n system. Multiple-proxy data from planktonic foraminifers from sediment Core MD96-2080 on the Agulhas Bank provide a detailed reconstruction  of  surface-ocean  paleoclimatology  in  the  area. Continued  warming  across  full-glacial  stages  (marine  isotop e Stages [MIS] 2 and 6) displayed in planktonic $\mathrm{Mg/Ca}$ data implie s increased influence of warm Agulhas water in the region and/or reduced northward advection of cold subantarctic surface wate r (Martínez-Méndez et al., 2010) (Figure F6). This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that peak Agulhas leakage occurred durin g glacial terminations and plausibly aided the AMOC to shift to it s full-strength interglacial mode (Knorr and Lohmann, 2003, 2007; Peeters et al., 2004). A high-resolution faunal record of the accumulation rate of tropical species Globorotalia menardii at ODP Sit e 1087 in the southern Benguela region was used to infer that Agulha s leakage strengthened during every glacial termination of the pas t $1.3\;\mathrm{my}$ (Caley et al., 2012). The Caley et al. (2012) interpretation o f increased leakage during terminations in the Late Pleistocene is als o supported by combined alkenone $\mathrm{Uk}^{37}$ and δD) and dinoflagellat e cyst assemblages, SST, and salinity estimates from Site 1087 (Petric k et al., 2015).  

SST and salinity records at an upstream location along th e southeast African margin (Core MD96-2048; $26^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ ) (Caley et al., 2011) display prominent 41 ky cyclicity that was interpreted to suggest that long-term Agulhas Current variations were associate d with high-latitude (as opposed to regional tropical) climate forcing. However, the cyclicity also suggests that some of the apparent variability in Agulhas leakage could actually be changes in the Agulha s Current. Thus, to circumvent the potential problem that AL F (Peeters et al., 2004) and G. menardii (Rau et al., 2006; Caley et al., 2012) indexes might be sensitive to the changing composition of th e Agulhas source assemblage upstream, Caley et al. (2014) proposed  a new quantitative foraminiferal-based proxy index for Agulhas leakage, named Agulhas leakage efficiency, and suggested that Agulha s leakage efficiency represents the transfer of Agulhas water from th e Indian Ocean to the Atlantic independent of the variations in th e source assemblage. Using this approach, Caley et al. (2014) confir m substantial changes in Agulhas leakage volume transports at the termination of glacial periods $(>\!10\,\,\mathrm{Sv})$ and possibly a complete halt o f leakage during MIS 12.  

The composition of terrigenous sediment in core tops of marin e sediment cores around South Africa shows significant and systematic provenance variations (Franzese et al., 2006, 2009). Provenanc e studies using $^{87}\mathrm{Sr}/^{86}\mathrm{Sr},$ , eNd, and $^{230}\mathrm{Th}_{\mathrm{xs}}$ flux estimates from Holo - cene and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) samples from a number o f cores near the tip of South Africa were used to suggest reduced advection of sediment derived from Agulhas water (and therefore possibly Agulhas leakage) during peak glacial times (Franzese et al., 2006). In a follow-up study, Franzese et al. (2009) made a more detailed geographic study of Holocene and LGM samples from a set o f cores from the R/V Charles Darwin 154 site survey cruise as well a s additional cores from the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory repository from the Agulhas Plateau. The interpretations from thes e two studies support a weaker Agulhas Current and less leakage, a s well as an Agulhas trajectory very similar to modern. These result s are partly at odds with models that suggest over glacial–interglacial cycles, if the wind pattern is fixed but its strength reduced, a weake r Agulhas Current results in increased leakage (De Ruijter, 1982; Dijkstra and De Ruijter, 2001; Van Sebille et al., 2009). However, if th e winds shift northward and weaken during glacial periods, a weake r Agulhas Current could combine with reduced leakage. The equivocal comparison between data and models call for further work including multiproxy analyses.  

A key question concerning Agulhas leakage is: How importan t are the locations of the STF and westerly wind belts? For instance, early work from Core MD96-2080 from the western flank of th e Agulhas Bank (Rau et al., 2006) showed the continuous presence o f subtropical planktonic foraminifers (e.g., G. menardii); this observation implies persistent Indian-Atlantic surface water flow durin g the last $450\,\mathrm{ky}$ . On the other hand, transient occurrences of subpolar species (Neogloboquadrina pachyderma dextral) suggest intermittent incursions of cold subantarctic waters in the Agulha s corridor during glacial periods (Rau et al., 2002, 2006), perhaps th e result of meridional shifts of the subtropical and subantarcti c fronts. SST records and ocean productivity indicators near the eastern entrance of the Indian-Atlantic ocean gateway in Core MD96- 2077 are tentatively taken to support such a scenario in that the y suggest that during some full-glacial stages the STF moved northward by as much as $7^{\circ}$ in latitude (Bard and Rickaby, 2009), thus potentially severely reducing Agulhas Current transports into th e gateway and limiting leakage to the South Atlantic. However, thi s picture is contrasted by substantial increases of ALF (Peeters et al.,  

2004) in the Agulhas corridor at the termination of glacial periods, alluding to an involvement of Agulhas leakage in interhemispheri c ocean and climate change, notably the resumption of NADW formation (Peeters et al., 2004). Additionally, the records of Caley et al. (2014) and Petrick et al. (2015) also demonstrate Agulhas leakag e was a persistent feature of the past $500\;\mathrm{ky},$ including glacial MIS 1 0 (Caley et al., 2014), apparently at odds with a substantial effect o n Agulhas leakage caused by the significant northward migration o f the STF (Bard and Rickaby, 2009).  

Multiple-species stable isotope and alkenone data from OD P Site 1085, slightly further north, also suggest that Agulhas leakag e variability during MIS 11 was directly related to AMOC activity an d wind forcing. Site 1085 shows evidence for strengthened leakage a t the end of MIS 11 that may have contributed to renewed ice-shee t build-up and the demise of warm conditions (Dickson et al., 2010).  

Recent reconstructions detailing the multicentennial- to millennial-timescale hydrographic variability in the Agulhas corridor hav e been published for the last glacial cycle $80\,\mathrm{\ka}$ to present; Cor e MD02-2594) (Dyez et al., 2014), the previous two glacial–interglacial climate cycles of MIS 8–5 (Core MD96-2080; 265–77 ka) (Marino et al., 2013), and upstream in the Agulhas Current for the las t glacial cycle (Core CD154 17-17K; Simon et al., 2013). These studie s confirm a connection of leakage maxima with glacial–interglacia l climate transitions and extend the connections to millennial-scal e salinity anomalies that appear to systematically coincide with accelerated warming at the end of the North Atlantic cold phases (stadials).  This  finding  lends  credence  to  earlier  hypothetica l considerations (Lutjeharms, 2006a) and numerical models (Knor r and Lohmann, 2003; Weijer et al., 2002; Biastoch et al., 2008) pointing to Indian-Atlantic salt leakage as an essential modulator o f abrupt climate change. However, reanalyses of a freshwater LG M hosing experiment using a fully coupled atmosphere–ocean genera l circulation model (Gong et al., 2013) has been recently used to suggest that the millennial-scale salinity increases in the Agulhas corridor are consistent with the presence of a quasi-interhemispheri c salt seesaw. This salt seesaw is analogous to the thermal bipolar seesaw, responding to reduced cross-hemispheric heat and salt exchange during times of weakened AMOC (Simon et al., 2015a). Indeed, Simon et al. (2015a) suggest that although more upstrea m saline Agulhas water was propagated to the Indian-Atlantic ocea n gateway during Heinrich Stadial 1, the salt flux into the South Atlantic, through the Indian-Atlantic ocean gateway, during that tim e was actually reduced. Accordingly, intervals with higher salinity i n the Agulhas Current source region cannot necessarily be taken t o indicate increased salt exchange through the Indian-Atlantic ocea n gateway into the South Atlantic, thus calling for further study.  

# Agulhas Current links with southern African climates and rainfall patterns  

Southern Africa spans a significant range of climatic and vegetation zones (Figure F7) from the low-latitude tropical regime that i s primarily under the influence of the Intertropical Convergenc e Zone (ITCZ) and Congo Air Boundary (CAB) to the high souther n latitudes that are influenced by the northern extensions of the circum-Antarctic westerly wind belt (Tyson, 1986; Chase and Meadows, 2007). The ITCZ and CAB collectively form the divid e between easterly winds arriving from the Indian Ocean and westerly winds from the Atlantic (Leroux, 1983). Presently, the southernmost extent of the seasonal migrations of the ITCZ and CAB i s situated over the Zambezi Catchment during austral summer (December, January, and February [DJF]). The Zambezi Catchment i s the largest riverine catchment in southeastern Africa, with headwaters extending far into the continental interior. Because of th e northern position of the African rainfall belt as well as the presenc e of mountain ranges of the East African Rift zone, annual rainfall amounts are higher across the Zambezi Catchment compared to th e neighboring Limpopo Catchment to the south. Although directl y connected with the ITCZ, the convergence zone over tropical southern Africa is decoupled on occasion from the divide betwee n dry trade winds in the east and wet monsoon in the west, as occurring, for instance, over West Africa in summer. Rainfall intensity today in southeast Africa is correlated to SST variability in th e southwest Indian Ocean and the Agulhas Current regime (Reaso n and Mulenga, 1999; Walker, 1990; Jury et al., 1993; Reason, 2002; Singleton and Reason, 2007). Additionally, today’s interannual variability of precipitation in South Africa is also antiphased with tha t of tropical East Africa (Goddard and Graham, 1999). It is apparen t from modern observations that terrestrial precipitation record s have very regional patterns, and thus understanding past variabilit y requires records from a range of archives that span this variability.  

During the Late Pleistocene, shifts in African climate have bee n largely paced by regional insolation changes driven by orbital precession (deMenocal et al., 1993). These changes result in antiphase d summer insolation maxima between the Northern and Souther n Hemispheres, which drives an interhemispheric temperature contrast resulting in zonal shifts of the ITCZ and imprint of the summer  monsoonal  rainfall  (Kutzbach  et  al.,  2008).  Additionally, African climate is impacted by high-latitude forcing predominantl y varying on longer obliquity and eccentricity timescales (Tuenter e t al., 2003; Weber and Tuenter, 2011). Although in the low-latitud e tropics African climate is dominated by the influence of the ITC Z and associated rain belts, studies from central and eastern Afric a document the increasing influence of the Atlantic and India n Oceans (Castañeda et al., 2007; Schefuß et al., 2005; Tierney et al., 2008). Whereas longer term climate evolution of the African continent is documented by a variety of terrestrial and marine records, the history of the northeastern and southeastern tropical Afric a (e.g., Schneider et al., 1997; Johnson et al., 2002; Schefuß et al., 2005; Castañeda et al., 2007; Weldeab et al., 2007; Tierney et al., 2008, 2011; Ziegler et al., 2010; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2014) is better constrained than southern Africa. Southern African records are sparse, fragmented, and often suffer from a lack of robust age framework s (e.g., Gasse et al., 2001; Partidge et al., 1997, 2004; Chase et al., 2007; Collins et al., 2014). Such information is important because variability has significantly influenced African biomes during the Pleistocene, and this has in turn affected the distributions of species as well as human demography (Scott et al., 2008).  

Lake Malawi, the southernmost of the East African Rift lakes i n the southern tropics, provides the only available continuous continental record of the last $1.3\ \mathrm{my}$ of terrestrial climate in souther n East Africa. Reconstruction of temperature (using the organic prox y $\mathrm{TEX}_{86})$ and aridity (using leaf wax $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}_{.}$ ) indicates a variable and predominantly arid climate that has $40~\mathrm{ky}$ periodicity prior to $900{\mathrm{~ka}}$ (the mid-Pleistocene transition [MPT]), shifting to a more humi d environment after the MPT. After the MPT, the record has stron g $100~\mathrm{ky}$ periodicity, with warmer and wetter conditions in interglacial intervals and relatively cool and dry glacial intervals (Johnson e t al., submitted). The inferred shift in climate conditions across th e MPT is supported by additional sedimentological proxies that indicate lower lake levels prior to the MPT followed by higher amplitude lake level variability and overfilled lake conditions until ${\sim}100$ ka punctuated by intervals of short-lived extreme drought (Lyons e t al., 2015). A similar story for the MPT is also found in the record o f African $C_{4}$ plant abundance from ODP Site 1077 in the tropica l South Atlantic, although this record does not exhibit the shift toward overall more humid conditions for the last ${\sim}900\,\mathrm{ky}$ (Schefuß e t al., 2003).  

Lake Malawi is located in northwestern part of the Zambez i Catchment, which drains into the Indian Ocean at ${\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ . A $\delta\mathrm{{D}_{\mathrm{{leafwax}}}}$ record in sediment Core GeoB 9307-3 off the Zambezi River documents brief and distinctly wetter intervals that correlate with th e Younger Dryas and Heinrich Stadial 1 (Schefuß et al., 2011). Together with BIT index (the relative abundances of branched glycero l dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) and the isoprenoid GDGT, crenarchaeol (Hopmans et al., 2004; Huguet et al., 2007) and X-ra y fluorescence data, this proxy record is taken to indicate that rainfal l intensities and Zambezi sediment discharge increase because of  a southward shift of the ITCZ during Northern Hemisphere col d events. However, in an apparent contradiction, the $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{leafwax}}$ recor d of this core shows an increased abundance of drought-tolerant $C_{4}$ grasses during these inferred wet intervals. This discrepancy in $C_{3^{-}}$ $C_{4}$ plants is probably attributed to shifts in source areas within th e Zambezi subcatchments, as inferred from magnetic mineral inventories (Just et al., 2014), presumably due to changes in the locus o f rainfall.  

A more distal, deeper coring site ${\sim}200\,\mathrm{km}$ north of the Zambez i River mouth at ${\sim}1300\mathrm{\;m}$ water depth provides continuous sedimentary records spanning the last ${\sim}40~\mathrm{ky}$ . A high-resolution record o f neodymium isotopes (εNd) in the lithogenic clay fraction from on e of the cores (64PE304-80) is interpreted to reflect changes in Zambezi sediment discharge relative to sediment transported fro m more northern sources by the strong net southward eddy-induce d flow through the Mozambique Channel (van der Lubbe et al., 2016). The reconstructed intervals of enhanced Zambezi discharge are i n agreement with the δD rainfall record obtained from a parallel cor e (GIK16160-30; Wang et al., 2013) after correction for the $C_{3}..C_{4}$ vegetation abundances.  

Collectively, the evidence is consistent with the inference tha t the Zambezi Catchment experienced relatively wetter condition s during MIS 2 and the late Holocene, whereby Heinrich Stadial 1 an d the Younger Dryas stand out as intervals of extreme wet conditions. More arid conditions occurred during MIS 3 and between ${\sim}15$ an d $5\ \mathrm{ka}$ . The later interval is synchronous with but opposite in sign t o the African Humid Period in northern Africa. Altogether, Zambez i Catchment records document precession-paced changes in the African monsoonal rainfall belt with enhanced rainfall during period s of increased Southern Hemisphere summer insolation, superimposed by wet conditions during high-latitude Northern Hemispher e abrupt cold events.  

Progressing south, a 342 ky long pollen record from marine sediment Core MD96-2048 from $660\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth ${\sim}120\,\mathrm{km}$ south o f the Limpopo River mouth shows glacial–interglacial and precession-driven climate variations in the extent of the subtropical biom e (Dupont et al., 2011). On land the sediment record from Tswain g Crater, a meteorite impact north of Pretoria, provides the longes t terrestrial record of climate variability located directly in South Africa, spanning the last $200~\mathrm{ky}.$ Clastic particle size variations fro m this site have been used to suggest that cyclic changes in precipitation were linked with the long-term effect of regional insolatio n changes driven by orbital precession (Partridge, et al., 1997, 2004).  

Marine sediment Core CD154-10-06P located off the east coas t of subtropical South Africa, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), reveals shifts i n river runoff at the southeast African margin spanning the past 27 0 ky that also strongly follow orbital precession pacing (Figure F8). Xray fluorescence elemental data from Simon et al. (2015b) show humid phases that can be plausibly connected with millennial-scal e Northern Hemisphere cold events. These excursions extend thos e recently identified in similar data from Core CD154-17-17K, a littl e further south, that were linked periods of early modern human innovation during the middle Stone Age (Ziegler et al., 2013). Some o f the millennial-scale events recorded in the eastern South Afric a runoff records are coincident with periods of enhanced dune activity and mobility in the Kalahari and Namib Deserts and are consistent with the suggestion of shifted rainfall patterns and win d regimes (Stokes et al., 1999; Thomas et al., 2000; Stuut et al., 2002). Broadly, the conclusion drawn from the data is that past continental climate changes in southern Africa were linked with changes i n ocean and atmospheric circulation, some directly associated wit h meridional shifts of the ITCZ, the Antarctic circumpolar ocea n fronts, and the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude westerlies.  

A particularly intriguing feature of both emergent records fro m stalagmites in coastal caves in South Africa (Bar-Matthews et al., 2010) and marine sediment cores at the southeast African continental margin (Schefuß et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Ziegler et al., 2013; Just et al., 2014; van der Lubbe et al., 2014, 2016; Weldeab e t al., $2014;$ Simon et al., 2015b) is the indication of recurrent but spatially variable millennial oscillations of rainfall patterns.  

Precession-only sensitivity experiments using a high-resolutio n fully coupled ocean-atmosphere model (altering the seasonal an d latitudinal distribution of solar insolation) supports the proxybased interpretations described from previous studies. These simulations show that during precession maxima (Pmax), higher Southern  Hemisphere  summer  (DJF)  insolation  causes  highe r temperatures and lower surface pressure over the Southern Hemisphere, especially over land (Figure F9). Specifically, lower pressur e during Pmax compared to precession minima (Pmin) over Sout h Africa and higher surface pressure over the southern Indian Ocea n results in stronger easterly surface winds blowing toward easter n South Africa (Figure F9). Over land, convection also increases, resulting in greater precipitation and greater net precipitation (precipitation minus evaporation) over nearly all of southern Afric a during Pmax. The enhanced precipitation during Pmax is particularly pronounced in the KZN and Eastern Cape province region, compared to other regions further north or west, which results i n higher surface runoff in the KZN and Eastern Cape province an d explains the considerable spatial variability observed in differen t core sites adjacent to land in the southwest Indian Ocean.  

# Density profile of the LGM ocean  

The circulation of the deep ocean at the LGM is a crucial piec e of the puzzle to understand past variations in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and glacial–interglacial cycles more generally. Although the distribution of sedimentary deep-ocean circulation tracers $\delta^{13}C,$ Cd/Ca, eNd, an d $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O})$ indicate that LGM ocean circulation was likely different tha n that of the modern ocean (e.g., Rutberg et al., 2000; Piotrowski et al., 2004, 2005; Marchal and Curry, 2008; Lund et al., 2011), the distributions of these properties are inconclusive enough that they ma y also be consistent with modern circulation and differences in surface forcing (e.g., Gebbie, 2012; Gebbie and Huybers, 2006; LeGrand and Wunsch, 1995). Thus, to understand the role of the dee p ocean in ice age climate variability, we require a more robust assessment of ice age deep-ocean variability, using a suite of tracers characterized by wide-ranging sensitivity to surface forcing.  

In the modern ocean, we use the patterns of temperature an d salinity to map the distribution of deep-water masses. In addition, these values inform the balance of air–sea exchange processes tha t are required to create the negative buoyancy to form deep water; they are an integrated record of climate at high latitudes. It would b e ideal to use the same strategy for the ice age ocean. However, ther e are few available means to develop a full temperature-salinity plo t for the LGM. Schrag and DePaolo (1993) and Schrag et al. (1996, 2002) pioneered a strategy for quantifying the $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ of seawater b y sampling a profile of deep-ocean sediment, making highly precis e measurements of $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and applying diffusion models to calculat e the value of LGM water. This strategy has been expanded to includ e $\left[{\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{:}}$ , thus allowing an estimate of salinity (Adkins et al., 2002; Adkins, 2013; Miller et al., 2015). With local $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ data from benthi c foraminifers, pore water information can be turned into a singl e point on the LGM temperature-salinity diagram. The current version of this plot, from sampling IODP material, contains only fou r points (Figure F10) (Adkins et al., 2002). The relative scarcity of th e observations stems from the requirements of the approach: sediment must be drilled to $>\!150\,\mathrm{m}$ below seafloor to properly measur e and model the diffusion profile; a well-behaved sediment column, free of complicated fluid flow and diagenesis, must be sampled; an d an entire hole must be dedicated to the pursuit. Nevertheless, despite the stringent requirements this approach is currently the mos t direct way to estimate physical properties and structure of the ic e age deep ocean.  

In any case, the existing data imply that there were larger-thanmodern density differences between deep-ocean watermasses at th e LGM and most of the ocean lies close to the freezing point an d therefore differences in density were due primarily to salinity (se e also discussion in Miller et al., 2012). Most surprisingly, the salt gradient in the modern Atlantic of fresh southern-sourced waters an d salty northern-sourced waters appears to have been reversed at th e LGM. This suggests the saltiest waters of the LGM ocean originate d in the Southern Hemisphere. Adkins et al. (2002) concluded tha t Glacial Southern Source Bottom Water (GSSBW) was the denses t due to its high salinity. Enhanced density differences betwee n northern-sourced and southern-sourced bottom waters indicat e greater vertical stratification. A stronger vertical stratification at th e LGM would help explain indications that there was a physically isolated reservoir of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the deep ocean at this time (Broecker an d Barker, 2007). In the years since this early work, analytical measurement of $\left[{{\bf{C}}{\bf{l}}-}\right]$ has been improved, several new sampling strategie s have targeted increasing throughput, and the data analysis tool s used to model the data have been improved. The next most important step in constraining the temperature, salinity, and density structure of the LGM deep ocean is to obtain depth transects of thes e properties. To this end, samples taken during Expedition 361 spanning from 450 to $3040\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth will be used to help constrai n the processes that could fill the LGM deep ocean and control its circulation.

• To understand the remote tropical origins of Agulhas Current variability: evidence for variation of the Agulhas leakage in highly resolved temporal records will be compared to records of Indonesian Throughflow and monsoon modulation on the Agulhas Current source region and impacts on warm and saltwater transports along the southeast African margin and IndianAtlantic saltwater leakage;   
• To better determine southern African climate sensitivity: comparison of varying Agulhas Current warm-water transports with rainfall patterns in southern Africa, in connection with the Pliocene–Pleistocene evolution of tropical climates, ITCZ migration, and tectonic history of eastern Africa; and   
• To provide further verification of glacial–interglacial variations in the Southern Ocean’s role in the carbon cycle: nutrient cycling, productivity, and $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ and their role in global biogeochemical cycles.  

Additionally, Expedition 361 will complete an intensive interstitial fluids program aimed at constraining the temperature, salinity, and density structure of the LGM deep ocean, from the bottom o f the ocean to the base of the main thermocline. High-resolution interstitial water samples will be utilized for $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and chloride measurements to characterize the salinity of the bottom water and t o deconvolve the temperature and ice volume control on $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ of benthic foraminifers.  

# Principal results Site U1474  

Site  U1474  is  located  in  the  northernmost  Natal  Valle y $31^{\circ}13.00^{\prime}\mathrm{S};$ ; $31^{\circ}32.71^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ) ${\sim}88~\mathrm{nmi}$ south-southeast of Durban, Sout h Africa, in a water depth of $3045\,\mathrm{~m~}$ below sea level (mbsl). Th e north-south–trending Natal Valley is a sediment-filled basin between the coast of southeast Africa and Mozambique Ridge. At it s northern end, the shoaling valley passes into the extensive coastal plains of Southern Mozambique (Dingle et al., 1978; Goodlad,  

1986), whereas toward the south the deepening Natal Valley merge s with Transkei Basin below $4500\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ . Terrigenous sediment suppl y into the basin is dominated by seasonal discharge from the numerous short but fast-flowing rivers that characterize the drainage system  of  the  Natal  coast  (e.g.,  the  Tugela  River),  as  well  a s contributions from the Limpopo River and possibly the Zambez i River. Surface sediment dispersal is strongly affected by the ${\sim}100$ km wide Agulhas Current flowing southward close to the continental shelf edge and transporting ${\sim}70$ Sv at $32^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (Beal and Bryden, 1999) with surface velocities up to $1.5~\mathrm{m/s}$ . At depth, the northward-flowing Agulhas Undercurrent hugs the continental slope, currently transporting NADW. The currents related to this northward flow have led to the formation of a network of elongate, northsouth–orientated sediment drifts.  

According to Lutjeharms (2006a), the Agulhas Current can b e considered to be fully constituted at ${\sim}26^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , around Ponto do Ouro, close to the border between Mozambique and South Africa. Here, the East Madagascar Current converges with Mozambique Channe l throughflow to form the Agulhas Current. The northern section o f the Agulhas Current system, above Site U1474, is extraordinaril y stable due to the steep, nearly rectilinear continental shelf that topographically steers the current flow southward (de Ruijter et al., $1999\mathbf{a}$ ; Lutjeharms, 2006a, 2007).  

Several high-resolution orbital- to millennial-timescale record s from shallow-penetration marine sediment cores located near Sit e U1474 (Ziegler et al., 2013; Simon et al., 2013, 2015a, 2015b) hav e provided multiproxy reconstruction of hydrographic variabilit y within the main flow of the Agulhas Current as well as river discharge from the catchments of the Natal coast over the past $250\;\mathrm{ky}.$ . In particular, Simon et al. (2013) demonstrated a strong connectivity between upstream Agulhas Current hydrographic variability an d the phasing of temperature, salinity, and planktonic foraminiferalbased Agulhas leakage changes in the Agulhas leakage corridor, plausibly linked to the influence of recirculation within the southwest Indian Ocean subgyre, as predicted from physical oceanography  (e.g.,  Gordon,  1985;  Stramma  and  Lutjeharms,  1997). Additionally, it has been shown that changes in terrestrial climat e (hydroclimate) are related to regional precession-paced insolatio n changes and the effects associated with high-latitude abrupt climat e forcing (Simon et al., 2015b). When considered in combination wit h archaeological records, these records appear to provide evidence fo r links between climate and human settlement in South Africa durin g the middle Stone Age (Ziegler et al., 2013).  

Our primary objective was to recover a key Pliocene–Pleistocene sedimentary succession, including the early Pliocene warm period, mid-Pliocene expansion of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, and the MPT, formed under the influence of the upper reaches o f the Agulhas Current. The site is ideally located to provide  

• A reconstruction of Agulhas Current warm-water transports close to the start of the fully constituted Agulhas Current; • An upstream record that may allow discerning connections between Agulhas leakage and its headwater variability; • Evidence to understand the connections between southern African terrestrial climates and southeast Indian Ocean heat budgets, notably Agulhas Current warm-water transports and associated ocean-atmosphere heat and moisture transfer; • A record of the vigor and hydrography of NADW (or its precursors) transported to the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) and the southwest Indian Ocean; and  

• An interstitial water profile of $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and chloride ion concentration that can enhance the understanding of temperature, salinity, and density of the deep water bathing Site U1474 by providing an additional data point to the presently available pore water LGM temperature and salinity inventory.  

Site U1474 consists of eight holes ranging in penetration dept h from 3.1 to $254.1\mathrm{~m~}$ drilling depth below seafloor (DSF). Overall, 111 cores were recovered at this site. The advanced piston corin g (APC) system penetrated $794.0\ \mathrm{m}$ and recovered $809.79\mathrm{~m~}$ of cor e $102\%$ recovery). The half-length APC (HLAPC) system penetrate d $102.4~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $100.96\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $99\%$ recovery). A total o f $910.75\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment was recovered from the $896.4\,\mathrm{~m~}$ interval cored ( $102\%$ recovery) at Site U1474. The total time spent at Sit e U1474 was 7.6 days.  

# Sedimentology  

The sediment at Site U1474 consists of two lithologic units. Uni t I $_{0-0.5\mathrm{~m~}}$ coring depth below seafloor [CSF-A]) is composed o f brown foraminifer-bearing clay with nannofossils. Unit II $\left(0.5-\right.$ $254.07\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) is characterized by greenish gray foraminiferbearing clay with nannofossils alternating with intervals of greenis h gray nannofossil-rich clay with or without foraminifers. Nannofossil-rich clay is more common downhole. Dark gray foraminiferbearing fine-sand layers ranging in thickness from a few centimeter s to $<\!2\,\mathrm{n}$ are common in Unit II (typically 1–3 per core). The composition of these sandy layers is predominantly quartz with carbonate, and many have erosional bases. Sediment in Unit II includes dar k gray mottling that we interpret as bioturbation. The relative intensity of the bioturbation typically increases with depth throughou t Unit II. Sediment in Unit II also includes millimeter- to centimeterscale green layers that contain pyrite and glauconite based on X-ra y diffraction (XRD) and smear slide observations. These layers represent diagenetic alterations.  

Significant drilling disturbance was observed in the first sectio n of most of the cores and in the base of partial-stroke APC cores.  

# Physical properties  

Despite the relatively homogeneous lithology, physical parameters vary along the entire sequence. Porosity increases with dept h from 0 to $12.8\textrm{m}$ core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF-A), reaching a maximum of $72\%$ followed by a decrease to ${<}50\%$ at th e bottom of the cored section. This decreasing trend toward the bottom is likely due to compaction. Variations in gamma ray attenuation (GRA) density reflect the same compaction pattern. Natural gamma radiation (NGR) and magnetic susceptibility markedly decrease in the upper $10\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ and increase to $130\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A. Below $130\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A, NGR and magnetic susceptibility values decrease to the base of the section. This decreasing trend occurs i n spite of compaction and thus likely reflects decreasing abundance s of clay and magnetic minerals within the sediment. Superimpose d on the general trends are cyclic variations in NGR of typically $\mathord{\sim}10-$ 15 counts/s, which may be related to the variable mixtures of terrigenous and biogenic sediment components. Fine-sand layers foun d throughout the cored section are clearly identified by peaks in magnetic susceptibility and GRA density values. Spectral reflectanc e shows a marked cyclic pattern downhole and broadly correspond s with the trends in color spectrometry values.  

# Micropaleontology  

Analysis of calcareous nannofossils, planktonic and benthic foraminifers, and diatoms from core catcher and split-core sample from Hole U1474A indicates that Site U1474 spans the Late Pleistocene to the latest Miocene $\left({\sim}6.2\,M\mathbf{a}\right)$ . Calcareous microfossils sho w good to moderate preservation in the upper $180\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A of th e site. Below this depth, preservation and fossil group abundances decrease. A complete sequence of calcareous nannofossil zones wa s found from the late Miocene (Biozones NN11–NN21) to Late Pleistocene. Evidence for reworking of calcareous nannofossils is foun d throughout the entire sequence in the persistent presence of earl y Miocene species. The calcareous nannofossil assemblages are typical of tropical to subtropical settings, although the temperate species, Coccolithus pelagicus, is found throughout the cored interval. Planktonic foraminifers also record a complete sequence of tropica l biozones that span Miocene Biozone M13 to Late Pleistocene Subbiozone Pt1b. The planktonic foraminifer fauna is dominated b y Globorotalia inflata, which is indicative of transitional environments between subtropical and polar watermasses, and in deepe r parts of the sequence the assemblage contains elements of the globoconellid group that are typical of subtropical convergence zones. Benthic foraminifer fauna is diverse and includes numerous suboxi c components characteristic of a lower bathyal to abyssal environment. Siliceous microfossils are characteristic of a modern India n Ocean assemblage and make up a minor component of the mudlin e sample. Below the mudline sample, sponge spicules are rare to trac e until they disappear completely below Sample 361-U1474A-10HCC ( $90.19\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A).  

The age model for Site U1474 is based on the biozonation of calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, the extinction of th e benthic foraminifer Stilostomella, and magnetostratigraphy (see below). These data reveal that sedimentation rates are nearly constan t throughout the recovered sequence, without major hiatuses.  A long-term linear sedimentation rate of ${\sim}3.7\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ is estimated.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic and rock magnetic analyses were carried out o n sediment cores from Holes U1474A–U1474H. Analyses of discret e samples taken from Hole U1474A indicate that the magnetic mineralogy is dominated by magnetite. The relatively high saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) and high and stable Sratios further reveal that magnetic minerals are well preserve d throughout the sequence. Below ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, an increase o f magnetic minerals is expressed by high SIRM. Inclination and declination records were obtained by measuring and demagnetizing th e natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of archive core halves an d discrete samples. The majority of the APC cores were oriented using the Icefield MI-5 tool. The inclination record is of good quality, and nine polarity zones can be identified. The boundaries of th e Brunhes, Matuyama, Jaramillo, Olduvai, Gauss, Gilbert, $C3\mathrm{n}_{}$ , an d C3r (sub)paleomagnetic chrons constrain the chronology of th e sediment and are in good agreement with the biostratigraphic data.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Continuous and distinctive variations in magnetic susceptibilit y were used make hole-to-hole correlations among Holes U1474A– U1474F. Confidence in these correlations is high because they ca n be cross-checked with continuous downcore measurements o f color reflectance parameter $L^{\ast}$ and NGR. A complete affine table t o the base of Hole U1474A was constructed to provide tabulated offsets for all cores relative to core depths (CSF-A). A continuou s splice was constructed downhole to $234\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-D using core s from Holes U1474D–U1474F where possible. For some intervals, i t was necessary to use sections from Hole U1474A, but sequences i n which whole-round samples had been removed were avoided. All sections of disturbed sediment were also avoided for constructio n of the splice. The continuity of the splice was confirmed with magnetic susceptibility, GRA density, NGR, and reflectance. Core intervals not included in the splice may be correlated to the CCSF- D depth scale using within-core variations of these data.  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water chemistry shows a moderate degree of earl y sediment diagenesis at Site U1474. Profiles of Mn and Fe indicat e suboxic conditions from the seafloor to $5\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ . Sulfate reduction occurs throughout much of the sediment column. The overall low organic carbon content, on average ${<}0.5\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ , does not suppor t complete removal of sulfate by $250\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ , and methane concentrations remain at background levels. Carbonate content of the pelagic sediment is moderate, averaging $40\,\mathrm{\,wt\%}$ . The sandy layer s contain significantly less carbonate than the nannofossil-rich clays, with values ranging between 20 and $30\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Profiles of conservativ e elements (K and $\mathrm{Mg},$ ) downhole suggest either fluid flow or cla y mineral alteration reactions at depths below $250\mathrm{\;m\;CSF-A}$ .  

# Site U1475  

Site U1475 is located on the southwestern flank of Agulhas Plateau $\mathrm{(41^{\circ}25.61^{\prime}S}$ ; $25^{\circ}15.64^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ) ${\sim}450\,\mathrm{\nmi}$ south of Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in a water depth of 2669 mbsl. The Agulhas Plateau, which was formed during the early stages of the opening of th e South Atlantic at ${\sim}90$ Ma (Parsiegla et al., 2008), is a major bathymetric high that is variably coated with sediment (Uenzelmann Neben, 2001). The $230,\!000{\mathrm{~km}}^{2}$ plateau, which ascends to ${\sim}2500\,\mathrm{~m~}$ above the adjacent seafloor, is bounded on the north by the $4700\;\mathrm{m}$ deep Agulhas Passage and is flanked by Agulhas Basin in the wes t and Transkei Basin in the northeast. The northern part of the plateau is characterized by rugged topography, whereas the central an d southern parts of the plateau exhibit relatively smooth topograph y (Allen and Tucholke, 1981) and have greater sediment thicknes s (Uenzelmann-Neben, 2001).  

A strong watermass transport flows across the Agulhas Platea u region (Macdonald, 1993), which involves the water column fro m the surface downward to the upper CDW. The hydrography of th e upper ocean is dominated by the Agulhas Return Current, whic h comprises the component of the Agulhas Current that is not leake d to the South Atlantic Ocean but rather flows eastward from the retroflection (Lutjeharms and Ansorge, 2001). Antarctic Intermediat e Water, below the Agulhas Return Current, also follows the sam e flow path near South Africa as the Agulhas Current and shows  a similar retroflection (Lutjeharms, 1996). During its return to th e southwest Indian Ocean, the Agulhas Return Current crosses th e Agulhas Plateau, which deflects the deep-reaching current towar d the Equator (Harris, 1970).  

Site survey data collected during seismic cruises with the R/ V Petr Kottsov in 1998 (Uenzelmann-Neben, 1998) and the $\mathrm{R}/\mathrm{V}$ Marion Dufresne in 2002 show that Site U1475 is located on a sedimen t drift (Uenzelmann-Neben, 2001, 2002) that is deposited on th e southwestern flank of Agulhas Plateau by NADW exiting the Sout h Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. The wedge-shaped sediment drif t thickens to the west, reaching a water depth of ${\sim}2510\;\mathrm{m}$ at its crest. The wavy character of the seafloor topography and the subsurfac e seismic reflection pattern are interpreted as sediment waves tha t document sedimentation by active deep-water flow. Site U1475 i s located at $2669~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , near the drift crest where minor buried depressions create a locally expanded sequence.  

Millennial-scale multiproxy records covering the past $350\ \mathrm{ky}$ previously collected at this location highlight the synchrony of th e regional ocean climatology and Antarctic climate variability. Evidence for regional ocean paleoclimatology includes latitudinal migrations of the regional Southern Ocean fronts and deposition o f ice-rafted debris that document expansion of sub-Antarctic conditions to the plateau. These data serve as evidence for possible meridional shifts in the subantarctic frontal zone that borders th e Agulhas leakage corridor and influences Agulhas leakage.  

Paleoceanographic studies spanning the past $350~\mathrm{ky}$ combine d with seismic reflection data support the suitability of Site U1475 t o achieve our primary objectives, which are to  

• Recover a complete Pliocene–Pleistocene sedimentary succession from a high-accumulation sediment drift located within the southern Agulhas Return Current sector of the Indian-Atlantic ocean gateway;   
• Assess the linking between Antarctic climate variations, circumpolar ocean front instability, and connections with Agulhas leakage into the South Atlantic;   
• Assess the vigor and hydrography of NADW (or its precursors) exported to CDW and the southwest Indian Ocean at a location proximal to the entrance of NADW to the Southern Ocean and South Indian Ocean; and   
• Evaluate the possibility of advective salinity feedbacks between Agulhas leakage and AMOC variability, notably the possible role of the leakage in modulating surface-to-deep ocean coupling in the North Atlantic during the transition between climatic states.  

Site U1475 consists of six holes that penetrated from 1.5 to 277. 0 m DSF. The APC system penetrated a total of $987.9\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered $1015.92\:\mathrm{m}$ of core $103\%$ core recovery). Six intervals advance d without coring to provide a continuous stratigraphic sequence penetrated a total of $86.0~\mathrm{m}$ . The total time spent at Site U1475 was 5. 7 days.  

# Sedimentology  

The sediment recovered at Site U1475 consists of two lithologi c units. Unit I ( $){-}4.75\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) is composed of pale brown, ligh t greenish or olive-gray, and white-gray nannofossil-rich foraminife r ooze. Unit II ( $4.75{-}277.22\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) is composed of light greenis h or pale gray to white-gray nannofossil ooze. Alternations betwee n foraminifer-bearing or foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze and nannofossil ooze with fine sand (foraminifers, quartz, and occasionall y diatoms) were observed.  

Sediment in both units includes dark gray mottling that we interpret as bioturbation (ichnofossil burrows [Planolites]). Thi n darker bands commonly surround burrows, and macroscopic pyritized burrows are also common. Dropstones displaying coarse san d to granule grain sizes were observed in three different cores, whic h we interpret to represent ice-rafted debris. Sediment in both unit s also includes green layers that predominantly consist of pyrite an d glauconite representing diagenetic alteration.  

# Physical properties  

Despite the homogeneous lithology, physical parameters sho w downhole trends as well as cyclic variations. A marked change i n physical sediment properties occurs at ${\sim}110\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Above thi s depth, a change from quasi-regular short and lower amplitude variations to longer, higher amplitude and more irregular cyclic variation is observed. This change is most clearly displayed in NGR an d color reflectance $\left(\mathbf{a}^{*}\right)$ data. In addition, $P$ -wave velocities decreas e and bulk densities increase at this depth, indicating a change i n compaction trend. Prominent changes in $P$ -wave velocity at Sit e U1475 can be clearly linked to seismic reflectors present in the sit e survey profiles.  

# Micropaleontology  

Analysis of calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers , and diatoms from core catchers and working-half core sample s from Holes U1475B, U1475C, and U1475E reveals that the ${\sim}277\mathrm{~m~}$ section recovered at Site U1475 spans the latest Miocene $({\sim}6.91\$ Ma) to recent. Calcareous nannofossils show moderate to goo d preservation in all sequences with the consistent presence of wellpreserved Eocene to middle Miocene (reworked) species. The nannofossil chronostratigraphy at Site U1475 spans from Biozone s NN21 and CN15 to NN11 and the Subbiozone CN9d/CN9c boundary. Calcareous nannofossil assemblages are characterized by species typical of tropical to subtropical and temperate environments. Planktonic foraminifer biota at Site U1475 are moderately to well preserved and are mostly composed of subtropical convergenc e species mixed with polar species. The Pleistocene foraminifer assemblage is dominated by G. inflata, which typically constitute s $30\%{-}50\%$ of each sample. Diatoms show poor to moderate preservation and have a mixed assemblage of subtropical and Souther n Ocean taxa. Diatom markers from both environmental settings ar e used to define datums; however, the Southern Ocean assemblag e abundance is greatly reduced below 101.62 m CSF-A. Overall, th e diatom chronostratigraphy spans from Biozone NTD17 to NTD12.  

Sedimentation rates at Site U1475, based on biostratigraphy an d paleomagnetic reversals during the Pleistocene and latest Pliocen e are nearly linear at $2.8\;\mathrm{{cm/ky}}$ between 0 and $3.9\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . A notable increase in sedimentation rates to $9.6\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ occurs between 3.9 an d $5.3\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . Finally, older than $5.3\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , sedimentation rates decrease t o $2.5\,\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ .  

# Paleomagnetism  

All archive halves from Holes U1475B, U1475C, and U1475 F and Cores 361-U1475E-1H through 15H were analyzed for NR M and demagnetized at 15 and $25~\mathrm{mT}$ . In total, 98 discrete cube samples were taken from Holes U1475A, U1475B, and U1475D an d subjected to NRM demagnetization. Cores from Site U1475 wer e not oriented because the relatively high latitude of the site mean s inclination data provide a reliable record of magnetic reversals. Fo r most of the recovered interval, magnetic susceptibilities indicat e that the sediment is diamagnetic in character and many results ar e below the detection limit of the whole-round and point magneti c susceptibility instruments. Nonetheless, taken together, the inclination records of all individual holes provide a consistent and detaile d magnetostratigraphy for Site U1475. The boundaries of the Brunhes, Matuyama, Jaramillo, Olduvai, Gauss, Kaena, and Mammot h paleomagnetic chrons and subchrons constrain the chronology o f the sediment and are in general agreement with the biostratigraphi c data.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Select sequences from Holes U1475B, U1475C, U1475E, an d U1475F were spliced together to create the most complete and representative section possible using RGB blue, $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ color reflectance, and NGR data. Sedimentological logs were consulted meticulousl y in the process of constructing the splice to avoid inclusion of an y obviously disturbed sections or sections with completely uniqu e features (relative to the other adjacent holes). The splice constitute s a continuous sequence with a total length of \~292 m CCSF-D. However, confidence in the splice is low surrounding occasional problematic intervals, and further work on shore will be required t o improve confidence.  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water chemistry shows a moderate degree of earl y sediment diagenesis at Site U1475. The nitrate profile indicates suboxic conditions in the upper $0.25\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Sulfate concentration s decrease throughout the sediment column, and sulfate is neve r completely consumed. Methane concentrations remain at background levels. Carbonate is the dominant sedimentary component, ranging from 75 to $85~\mathrm{wt\%}$ , with terrigenous material dominatin g the remaining fraction. Organic carbon contents range from 0.3 t o $0.6\:\mathrm{wt\%}$ , decreasing slightly downhole. Together, carbonate, organi c carbon, and elemental biogenic indicator profiles suggest that export production increased into the Late Pleistocene.  

# Site U1476  

Site U1476 is located on Davie Ridge at the northern entrance o f the Mozambique Channel $\left\langle15^{\circ}49.25^{\prime}\mathrm{S};\right.$ ; $41^{\circ}46.12^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ) at a water dept h of 2165 mbsl. It is $3\,\mathrm{nmi}$ northwest of DSDP Site 242.  

The Mozambique Channel is considered to be one of the mos t turbulent areas in the world ocean (Ternon et al., 2014), bordered b y Madagascar to the east and Mozambique to the west. At its southern end, flow through the channel feeds into the greater Agulha s Current system. The Mozambique Channel is characterized b y complex and variable surface and subsurface circulation. Severa l watermasses converge within the Mozambique Channel, and th e circulation is dominated by activity related to the inflow of both Indonesian Throughflow and Tasman Strait Throughflow as well a s the strength of the tropical and subtropical surface gyres in the Indian Ocean (Penven et al., 2006; Palastanga et al., 2006; Ridderinkhof et al., 2010; Schott et al., 2009; Backeberg and Reason, 2010). Satellite observations (e.g., Schouten et al., 2003; Quartly an d Srokosz, 2004) and ocean models (Biastoch and Krauss, 1999) hav e shown that mesoscale anticyclonic eddies generally form as th e channel narrows close to Davie Ridge (at about $16^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ ), between th e northern and central basin of the Mozambique Channel. These eddies typically maintain a high rotational velocity, often ${>}1.5\,\mathrm{~m/s~}$ (Schouten et al., 2003; Ullgren et al., 2012) as they migrate southward through the channel at a mean rate of ${\sim}4{-}7$ eddies a year. Accordingly, processes in the Mozambique Channel have downstrea m implications for the Agulhas Current including leakage into th e South Atlantic Ocean (e.g., Bryden et al., 2005; Biastoch et al., 2008, 2009b). Mozambique Channel eddies may also be linked with interannual modes of Indian and Pacific Ocean variability, implying  a connection with the Indian Ocean Dipole and Pacific La Niña/E l Niño phases (Schouten et al., $2002{\mathrm{a}}$ ; Palastanga et al., 2006).  

Limited paleoceanographic evidence currently exists regarding the longer term linkage between variability in the northern source waters of the Agulhas Current and its eventual leakage into the South Atlantic Ocean. The primary objectives at Site U1476 are to • Recover a complete Pliocene–Pleistocene sedimentary succession including the early Pliocene warm period, the mid-Pliocene expansion of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, and the MPT; • Reconstruct Mozambique Current warm-water transports during periods of orbitally modulated and suborbitally accelerated climate changes; and  

• Assess the influence of remote upstream forcing on southeast African warm-water transport.  

Specific questions that will be addressed include: Did the restriction of the Indonesian Seaway and the associated reduction of th e Indonesian Throughflow in the Pliocene affect the Agulhas Curren t source region in the western tropical Indian Ocean and subsequently impact warm-water and saltwater transports along th e southeast African margin? Did the Agulhas Current, by way of farfield controls on tropical–subtropical wind forcing, respond to th e long-term development of tropical climates and the associate d weakening of the monsoons in the course of the global cooling o f the Pliocene?  

Site U1476 consists of five holes that penetrated from 5.7 t o $234.8\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. The APC system penetrated a total of $841.1\mathrm{~m~}$ an d recovered $873.85\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(104\%)$ . One interval was advanced 1. 0 m without coring to adjust coring gaps to provide a continuous stratigraphic sequence. The total time spent at Site U1476 was 4.1 days.  

# Sedimentology  

Two lithologic units were described at Site U1476. Unit I (0– $34.57\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ ) is composed of light brown to greenish gray foraminifer ooze with nannofossils alternating with foraminifer-ric h nannofossil ooze. Unit II (34.57–235.41 m CSF-A) is composed o f greenish gray foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze and nannofossil ooze with foraminifers, silt, and clay.  

Sediment in both units includes dark gray mottling that we interpret as bioturbation. Thin darker bands commonly surroun d burrows, and macroscopic pyritized burrows are common. Sediment also includes green layers that predominantly consist of pyrit e and glauconite, which are diagenetic alterations. Only minor corin g disturbance is observed in the cores.  

# Physical properties  

Despite the relatively homogeneous lithology, different physica l parameters show significant trends downhole as well as cyclic variations along the sediment column. High-amplitude cyclic change s occur in the uppermost $^{16\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ CSF-A of all holes. These cycli c changes continue downward to the bottom of the holes with lowe r amplitude and higher frequency. Variations in color reflectance indicate sediment compositional changes and RGB data broadly correspond  with  color  reflectance  parameter $L^{\ast}$ .  Bulk  densitie s increase downhole due to compaction, but there are large variation s in the uppermost $16\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A that are also seen in the other physical properties.  

# Micropaleontology  

Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy indicates that Hole U1476A spans the Late Pleistocene to lat e Miocene. Diatoms are not included in the biostratigraphy becaus e the record is barren of diatoms throughout except for tropical diatoms present in minor amounts in the mudline sample. Calcareou s microfossils show very good preservation in Pliocene- to Pleistocene-age sediment; however, the late Miocene is characterized b y an increase of fragmented planktonic foraminifers. Assemblages i n both microfossil groups include tropical to subtropical forms wit h the periodic appearance of species typical of temperate environments. Sedimentation rates, based on calcareous nannofossil an d planktonic foraminifer datums, increase from 2.3 to $3.5\,\mathrm{\cm/ky}$ downhole. No hiatuses were observed; however, diachronous event s were observed within the planktonic foraminifer biochronology.  

These events might suggest that calibration of microfossil datum s from the tropical western Indian Ocean need refinement.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic and rock magnetic analyses were carried out o n sediment  cores  from  Holes  U1476A,  U1476B,  U1476D,  an d U1476E. All together, the rock magnetic data imply that the concentration of high-coercivity minerals (e.g., hematite and titanomagnetite) is relatively stable, whereas magnetite concentrations decreas e below $\mathord{\sim}150\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Demagnetization of NRM carried out on discrete samples and archive halves shows that the directional recor d carries a strong coring overprint. The uppermost two sections o f each core reveal steep downward inclinations after demagnetizatio n at maximum levels of $25~\mathrm{mT}$ suggesting that the applied field wa s too weak to remove the overprint. More detailed demagnetizatio n experiments on discrete samples show changes in inclination afte r demagnetization of $40~\mathrm{mT},$ , suggesting that sediment has an earl y diagenetic overprint that might be removed by demagnetization a t higher fields. Because the Icefield MI-5 orientation tool malfunctioned, the declination data could not be corrected for core orientation and can therefore not be used for assigning polarity zones.  A more detailed investigation of demagnetization behavior will b e needed to establish a more confident paleomagnetic stratigraph y for Site U1476.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Ideal coring conditions and good signal in the magnetic susceptibility measurements allowed for near–real time correlation at Sit e U1476. Coring offsets were applied in Holes U1476A and U1476 D so that no gaps were present downhole to the full depth of the hole s (229.0 m CSF-A). Hole U1476E provided similar offsets to Hol e U1476A so that a splice could be constructed primarily betwee n Holes U1476D and U1476E. The splice was constructed using magnetic susceptibility data and confirmed using NGR and RGB (blue ) data.  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water chemistry shows mild early sediment diagenesis at Site U1476. Nitrate and sulfate, two species that disappea r with  progressively  more  intense  microbial  respiration,  persis t deeper into the sediment column and at higher concentrations tha n was documented at Sites U1474 or U1475. Methane concentration s remain at or near background levels. Decreasing concentrations o f major elements, such as potassium and sodium, reflect uptake b y clay minerals. Carbonate is variable $(45\mathrm{-}75\mathrm{\wt\%})$ ), with terrigenou s sediment making up the remainder of the sediment. The sedimen t is organic carbon poor, with average concentrations of $0.24\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ total organic carbon (TOC).  

# Site U1477  

Site U1477 is located in the western Mozambique Channel on the upper continental slope $\mathrm{^{19^{\circ}21.29^{\prime}S_{\mathrm{:}}}}$ ; $36^{\circ}54.90^{\prime}\mathrm{E})$ ), ${\sim}65\;\mathrm{nmi}$ east of the Zambezi River delta region, at a water depth of 429.2 mbsl.  

Site U1477 receives fluvial material exported from the Zambez i Catchment, which is in the southernmost reach of the African monsoonal precipitation belt and drains multiple subbasins. Collectively, these subbasins span ${\sim}1.385$ million ${\bf k m}^{2}$ and the river itsel f extends more than $2500~\mathrm{km}$ . Annual precipitation across the Zambezi Catchment varies spatially with $\{\sim\}150\,\mathrm{cm}$ in the northern catchment region, ${\sim}85~\mathrm{cm}$ in the southern region, and $60{-}70~\mathrm{cm}$ in th e central region (Ronco et al., 2006). Peak precipitation in the Zambezi Catchment occurs during the austral summer (DJF), when th e ITCZ is located at its most southerly position.  

The mean outflow of the Zambezi River is $3000\;\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{s}$ (Gammelsrød, 1992), which transports an annual sediment load of ${\sim}51\;\mathrm{Mm}^{3}$ , making it the largest single source of suspended sediment supply t o the Mozambique margin (Walford et al., 2005). This fluvial sediment mixes with current-transported and biogenic material an d form a major component of the extensive current-controlled sedimentary deposits that characterize the Mozambique margin. Thi s sediment has the potential to provide comprehensive proxy record s of regional oceanographic changes as well as changes in hydrological conditions of the African precipitation belt in southeastern Africa (e.g., Just et al., 2014; Schefuß et al., 2011; Schulz et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Weldeab et al., 2013, 2014; van der Lubbe et al., 2014, 2016).  

Site U1477 is on a contourite drift deposited under the influenc e   
of the eddy-dominated water flow through the Mozambique Chan  
nel. The drift displays packages of parallel and laterally continuou s   
subseafloor reflectors. Site U1477 is immediately southwest of th e   
$6.51\,\mathrm{~m~}$ long sediment Core GeoB9307-3 $(18^{\circ}33.99^{\prime}\mathrm{S},$ , $37^{\circ}22.89^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$   
$542~\mathrm{mbsl})$ ) (Schefuß et al., 2011), which is in an area with elevate d   
sedimentation during the deglacial period to the Holocene. Existin g   
data from Core GeoB9307-3 suggest the great potential of Sit e   
U1477 for providing a centennial-scale paleoceanographic record. The Site U1477 primary objectives are to   
• Recover a complete high-resolution sedimentary succession that spans the last $2\;\mathrm{my}$ , including the MPT, from the Mozambique margin close to the Zambezi River delta;   
• Generate a high-resolution Pleistocene profile of southern African continental climate changes on orbital and suborbital timescales;   
• Establish linking between southern African terrestrial climates and southwest Indian Ocean heat budgets, notably warm-water transport along the southeast African margin and associated ocean–atmosphere heat and moisture transfer;   
• Examine the relationship between such climate variability and early human evolution; and   
• Reconstruct upstream control on Agulhas leakage through headwater variability during periods of orbitally modulated and suborbitally accelerated climate changes.  

Specific questions that will be addressed include: Did the longterm climatic developments of the Pleistocene, through their impact on atmospheric circulation, alter the rainfall patterns ove r southeast Africa, notably in conjunction with far-field responses t o East African uplift, monsoon dynamics, and migration of the ITC Z (Johnson et al., 2002; Schefuß et al., 2011; Trauth et al., 2009)? Di d variable Agulhas Current warm-water transport contribute to an d modulate the impacts of shifting air boundaries and rainfall pattern s over southeast Africa, and possibly offset these patterns from thos e over southwest Africa and the Namib (Dupont et al., 2005, 2011; Maslin et al., 2012)?  

The stratigraphic extent of Site U1477 was considerably shorte r than anticipated, with a maximum age of ${\sim}200\ \mathrm{ka}$ . As a result, th e paleoclimate site objectives will require adjustment to focus o n high–temporal timescale variability (centennial–decadal) over th e last glacial cycle. The remarkably high sedimentation rates at Sit e U1477 promise an unprecedented opportunity to investigate hydroclimate variability in southeastern Africa and its potential links t o changes in the greater Agulhas Current system.  

Site U1477 consists of three holes that penetrated from 119.4 t o $181.2\textrm{m}$ DSF. The APC system penetrated a total of $296.2\textrm{m}$ an d recovered $308.07\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(104\%)$ . The HLAPC recovered 174.0 0 m of sediment over a $169.2\textrm{m}$ interval $(103\%)$ ). The extended cor e barrel (XCB) was deployed for one core resulting in $7.96~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment $(97\%)$ . One interval was advanced $1.0\,\mathrm{m}$ without coring to adjust coring gaps to provide a continuous stratigraphic sequence. Th e total time spent at Site U1477 was 1.9 days.  

# Sedimentology  

Sediment at Site U1477 consists of two lithologic units. Unit  I $_{2-0.5\mathrm{~m~}}$ CSF-A) is composed of very dark gray to dark greenis h gray sandy clay with foraminifers and nannofossils. Unit II $\left(0.5-\right.$ $254.07\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}_{\prime}$ ) is composed of very dark gray to dark greenis h gray silty clay with intermittent to frequent occurrences of sand layers. These sand layers contain quartz and clay, and thicknesse s range from centimeter to meter scale.  

Bioturbation is not apparent in either unit. Macrofossils, including bivalve and echinoderm fragments, are present throughout th e cores. Many of the cores show disturbance related to gas expansion.  

# Physical properties  

Despite the relatively homogeneous lithology, physical parameters at Site U1477 show a complex pattern of high-amplitud e changes that are likely caused by climate-related variations in terrigenous sediment supply or current sorting effects. However, som e excursions to lower values in NGR and GRA bulk density data ma y be due to the voids caused by gas expansion. Also, the collection o f reliable $P.$ -wave data below $16.9\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in all of the holes was inhibited by strong signal attenuation resulting from the frequent occurrence of gas expansion voids. Porosities at Site U1477 decreas e downhole, and average porosities are significantly lower when compared to the previous sites (U1474– U1476).  

# Micropaleontology  

Site U1477 spans the Holocene to the Late Pleistocene. Two biostratigraphic datums were observed: the abundance crossover fro m Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica to Emiliana huxleyi at ${\sim}90~\mathrm{ky}$ and th e top occurrence of Globigerinoides ruber (pink) at ${\sim}120\,\mathrm{ky}$ . Sedimentation rates, based on biostratigraphic datums as well as radiocarbon ages tied in from a nearby piston core, suggest deposition rate s of ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{m/ky}$ from 0 to ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1477A that decreas e to ${\sim}83\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ from ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ to the base of the hole. Calcareou s microfossils are generally well preserved, although abundance i s typically low. Planktonic foraminifer tests compose ${<}1\%$ of sedimen t particles in most samples, whereas ${<}50$ nannofossils per field o f view were observed throughout most of the section. The planktoni c assemblage, which includes the regular occurrence of pteropods, i s joined by benthic foraminifers, ostracods, sponge and gorgonia n spicules, mollusks, echinoderm plates, and fish otoliths. Siliceou s microfossils make up a minor component of the mudline and cor e catcher samples. Marine and freshwater diatoms, phytoliths, an d sponge spicules are present, providing indications of both terrestria l and marine sources.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic measurements at Site U1477 show a clear magnetic signal. For all holes, inclinations center around $-50^{\circ}$ during th e Brunhes Chron, which is expected for the site location. Rock-magnetic data acquired on discrete samples reveal phases of high ferrimagnetic  mineral  content  that  largely  match  magneti c susceptibility data collected on archive section halves and whol e cores. Variations in magnetic minerals present reflect either  a change in the composition of the terrigenous fraction or preferential mineral dissolution.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Real-time stratigraphic correlation was possible at Site U147 7 using magnetic susceptibility data. Holes U1477A–U1477C wer e used for the splice from 0 to ${\sim}85\,\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A. Below ${\sim}85\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ , the splice consists primarily of sediment from Hole U1477B, with  a couple of exceptions where intervals of Hole U1477A were used.  A continuous stratigraphic splice was not possible at this site becaus e of substantial gas expansion that led to core fracturing and variabl e core stretching between holes.  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water chemistry and headspace gas concentration s show relatively intense early sediment diagenesis at Site U1477. Th e sulfate–methane transition appears at ${\sim}16\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, below whic h sulfate is completely consumed and methane concentrations increase rapidly to a peak of ${\sim}75{,}500$ ppmv at ${\sim}35\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Othe r redox-sensitive elements, including iron, manganese, and barium, show enrichments caused by remobilization. Terrigenous sedimen t dominates the core. Carbonate contents average $5\ \mathrm{{wt\%}}$ , with a fe w intermittent layers of shell material with carbonate contents as hig h as ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ . The average TOC content is $0.61\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ .  

# Site U1478  

Site U1478 is located in the Delagoa Bight on the Inharrime Terrace $\mathrm{25^{\circ}49.26^{\prime}S}$ ; $34^{\circ}46.16^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ) $\mathord{\sim}75$ nmi east of the Limpopo River at  a water depth of $488\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ .  

The Delagoa Bight is a distinct indentation of the continenta l margin (Lamont et al., 2010) into which the Limpopo River, the second largest eastward-draining river in Africa, deposits sediment. It s hydrography is influenced by the southerly flowing waters from th e Mozambique Channel and the East Madagascar Current (Lutjeharms, 2006a, 2006b), the confluence of which forms the Agulha s Current. The Limpopo Catchment is a little over $410,\!000\,\mathrm{km}^{2}$ , considerably smaller than that of the neighboring Zambezi. The Limpopo River has a mean annual discharge of ${\sim}170~\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{s}$ and deliver s annual sediment loads of $33\mathrm{~Mt/y}$ (Milliman and Meade, 1983) t o the Delagoa Bight.  

The Site U1478 primary objectives are to  

• Recover a complete high-resolution sedimentary succession that spans the last 2 my;   
• Generate a high-resolution Pleistocene profile of southern African continental climate changes on orbital and suborbital timescales;   
• Establish linking between southern African terrestrial climates and southwest Indian Ocean heat budgets, notably warm-water transports along the southeast African margin and associated ocean–atmosphere heat and moisture transfer;   
• Examine the relationship between such climate variability and early human evolution; and   
• Reconstruct upstream control on Agulhas leakage through headwater variability during periods of orbitally modulated and suborbitally accelerated climate changes.  

Specific questions that will be addressed include: Did the longterm climatic developments of the Pleistocene, through their impact on atmospheric circulation, alter the rainfall patterns ove r southeast Africa? Did variable Agulhas Current warm-water transports contribute to and modulate the impacts of shifting air boundaries and rainfall patterns over southeast Africa and possibly offse t these patterns from those over southwest Africa and the Nami b (Dupont et al., 2005; Maslin et al., 2012)?  

Site U1478 consists of four holes that penetrated from 216.0 t o $248.4\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. The APC system penetrated a total of $698.9\mathrm{~m~}$ an d recovered $708.66\:\mathrm{m}$ of core $(101\%)$ . The HLAPC recovered a total o f $213.4~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over a $206.8~\mathrm{m}$ cored interval $(103\%)$ . Five intervals were advanced $54.3~\mathrm{m}$ without coring to adjust coring gap s to provide a continuous stratigraphic sequence. The total time spen t at Site U1478 was 2.7 days.  

# Sedimentology  

Sediment at Site U1478 consists of one lithologic unit. Unit I (0– $248.59\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) is composed of dark olive-gray and dark greenis h gray sand with foraminifers and nannofossils that alternate wit h clayey or sandy silt with foraminifers and nannofossils. The sand i s predominantly composed of quartz.  

Bioturbation is rare; however, the coarser grained sediment a t Site U1478 may obscure sedimentary structures, such as bioturbation and diagenetic alterations. Macrofossils, including bivalves, gastropods, and echinoderms, are present throughout the cores.  

# Physical properties  

The physical properties measured at Site U1478 show a comple x pattern of amplitude changes and trends. All high-resolution records derived by physical properties core logging (magnetic susceptibility,  NGR,  GRA  bulk  density,  RGB  color,  and  spectra l reflectance) show cyclic changes that are likely related to the variable lithologic alternations between silt-rich and sand-rich intervals. These cyclic changes are pervasive throughout the sequenc e and probably reflect complex interactions between ocean circulation, sea-level fluctuations, and fluvial discharges recorded at Sit e U1478. Two zones of very low magnetic susceptibility values a t ${\sim}89{-}92$ and ${\sim}164{-}168\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A may be related to sediment diagenesis as indicated by elevated iron and manganese concentration s in the interstitial water. Porosities decrease downhole, and averag e porosities are similar to those at Site U1477 but are significantl y lower compared to the deeper water Sites U1474–U1476.  

# Micropaleontology  

Biostratigraphy of calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers indicates that Hole U1478A spans the Upper Pleistocene t o the middle Pliocene with a basal age of ${\sim}4\mathrm{~Ma}$ . Calcareous microfossil assemblages include warm subtropical to tropical species i n combination with coastal- to slope-water taxa. Planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils are abundant throughout Sit e U1478. Foraminifers dominate sandy beds, whereas calcareous nannofossils are typically more abundant in silty and clay-rich intervals. Glassy and translucent foraminifers are found throughout most o f the recovered sequence, although fragmentation increases in th e oldest parts of the sequence. Calcareous nannofossils are mostl y well preserved, but the Discoaster group commonly exhibits fragmentation of the delicate arms. Diatoms are present only in surfac e sediment, and sponge spicules and phytoliths are scarce in the lowe r parts of the sequence. Low levels of reworking are evident in planktonic foraminifer records. The biochronology for both calcareou s microfossil groups reveals sedimentation rates of ${\sim}9\mathrm{\cm/ky}$ between the Late Pleistocene and ${\sim}2.1$ Ma and lower rates of $2.9{-}5.3$ $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ older than $2.1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Planktonic foraminifers and calcareou s nannofossils give diverging age-depth relationships between 1.9 an d  

$3\;\mathrm{Ma}_{\mathrm{~}}$ , which is possibly linked to sedimentological processes. Th e two fossil groups are in agreement in the lowermost ${\sim}25\mathrm{~m~}$ of Sit e U1478 and predict a basal age of $4{-}4.1\;M\mathrm{a}$ .  

# Paleomagnetism  

Rock magnetic and paleomagnetic analyses were carried out o n discrete samples from Hole U1478A and archive-half sections fro m Holes U1478A–U1478D. SIRM and hard isothermal remanen t magnetization (HIRM) measured on discrete samples largely follo w downcore patterns in magnetic susceptibility. The S-ratio is mostl y stable; however, distinct minima at ${\sim}90$ , 165, and $245\mathrm{\;m\,CSF-A}$ indicate a strong depletion of low-coercivity minerals. These interval s coincide with minima in the magnetic susceptibility and SIRM records. The minimum in magnetic susceptibility at ${\sim}90\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A lie s below the sulfate–methane transition, and the minimum at ${\sim}165\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A is located just below an interval of elevated dissolved Fe an d Mn concentrations, suggesting that in these zones early diageneti c processes affected the magnetic mineral record.  

Inclination data appear to be of good quality, and the Brunhes/Matuyama Chron boundary and the Jaramillo Subchron wer e identified. According to biostratigraphy, the sedimentary sequenc e dates to ${\sim}4\mathrm{~Ma}$ ; however, the Matuyama–Gauss Chron transitio n was not identified in the paleomagnetic data.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Four holes were drilled at Site U1478 using the APC an d HLAPC. Generally good core quality and clear magnetic susceptibility signals resulted in robust and unambiguous stratigraphic tie s between holes. We have high confidence that these holes constitut e a nearly complete section spanning the full length of the longes t hole $\mathrm{^{244}\ m}$ recovered in Hole U1478A), with the exception of on e probable gap at ${\sim}195\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. The objective of obtaining a complete section was aided by the fact that the magnetic susceptibilit y from whole-round physical property loggers could be used for realtime correlation in Holes U1478B–U1478D; adjustments to th e drilling depth were made in these holes for the purpose of avoidin g potential core gap alignment. A continuous splice was constructe d for the uppermost ${\sim}200\mathrm{\,m\,CCSF-D}$ , and a floating splice of anothe r ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m}$ of section is appended below the coring gap. In general, th e clarity of the stratigraphic ties and the multiple cross-checks available from several different data sets gives us high confidence in th e integrity of these two separate spliced sequences.  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water chemistry and headspace gas concentration s show relatively intense early sediment diagenesis at Site U1478. Th e sulfate–methane transition zone occurs at ${\sim}70\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, belo w which sulfate is completely consumed and methane concentration s increase rapidly. Several methane peaks occur below the sulfatemethane transition, with the largest of ${\sim}65{,}000$ ppmv at ${\sim}214\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Other redox-sensitive elements, including iron and manganese, also show multiple peaks at depth. These pulses of iron an d manganese and associated lows in magnetic susceptibility are interpreted as paleoredox horizons related to repeated fluctuations i n sedimentation. Detrital material is the most important sedimentar y component. Carbonate contents average $28\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , and TOC content s average $0.5\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ; neither show any trend with depth.  

# Site U1479  

Site U1479 is located on a $30\,\mathrm{km}$ wide morphological high, rising ${\sim}200\ \mathrm{m}$ above the regional seafloor, on the mid-to-lower western  slope  of  the  Agulhas  Bank  in  Cape  Basin $\langle35^{\circ}03.53^{\prime}\mathrm{S};$ ; $17^{\circ}24.06^{\prime}\mathrm{E})$ , ${\sim}85\ \mathrm{nmi}$ southwest of Cape Town, South Africa, at  a water depth of 2615 mbsl.  

This region has been the focus of numerous oceanographi c studies and a growing number of paleoceanographic studies (e.g., Beal et al., 2011, and references therein) in order to describe th e present hydrography within the so-called Indian-Atlantic ocea n gateway (or “Agulhas ring corridor”; Gordon, 2003) and also to gai n a better understanding of past oceanographic variations in the are a and how they may be related with global climate changes. Severa l studies have highlighted the Agulhas Current’s sensitivity to climat e changes and reorganizations of atmospheric and the ocean circulation at large.  

As the Agulhas Current separates from the Agulhas Bank at th e southern tip of Africa, it retroflects, shedding rings, eddies, and filaments to the South Atlantic. This leads to leakage of between 2 an d $20\:S\mathbf{v}$ of Indian Ocean water into the Atlantic and affects the wate r column to depths of ${<}2000\ \mathrm{mbsl}$ (Gordon et al., 1987; de Ruijter e t al., $1999\mathbf{a}$ ; Richardson, 2007).  

The Agulhas ring corridor is an area in which retrieval of highquality sediment cores is difficult. The southeast African margi n has a very narrow shelf and a steep continental slope, leading to frequent sediment instability and slumping. Furthermore, the vigorou s Agulhas Current and its variability can cause sediment redistribution because meanders and eddies frequently reach the seafloor. Yet, a number of published studies and emerging work demonstrat e that paleoceanographic records of excellent quality are in fac t achievable for reconstructing both surface and deep-water variability in the region (e.g., Rau et al., 2002, 2006; Peeters et al., 2004; Martínez-Méndez et al., 2010; Dickson et al., 2010; Caley et al., 2011, 2012, 2014; Marino et al., 2013; Dyez et al., 2014; Petrick et al., 2015).  

The Site U1479 primary objectives are to  

• Recover a complete Pliocene–Pleistocene sedimentary succession, including the early Pliocene warm period, mid-Pliocene expansion of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, and the MPT, from a high-accumulation site located within the Agulhas ring corridor;   
• Reconstruct Agulhas Current warm-water transports during orbitally modulated and suborbitally accelerated climatic changes;   
• Assess the linking between Antarctic climate variations, circumpolar ocean front instability, and connections with Agulhas leakage into the South Atlantic;   
• Assess the vigor and hydrography of NADW, or its precursors, exported to CDW and the southwest Indian Ocean; and   
• Evaluate the possibility of advective salinity feedbacks between Agulhas leakage and AMOC variability, notably the possible role of the leakage in modulating surface-to-deep ocean coupling in the North Atlantic during the transition between climatic states.  

Site U1479 consisted of nine holes, ranging in depth from 1.0 t o $300.7\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. Overall, 105 cores were recorded for the site. A tota l of $963.21\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over a $975.3\;\mathrm{m}$ interval was recovered using th e APC system $99\%$ core recovery). Seven intervals were advance d without coring over $175.7\;\mathrm{m}$ . The total time spent at Site U1479 wa s 6.0 days.  

# Sedimentology  

Sediment at Site U1479 consists of one lithologic unit. Unit I (0– $301.03~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) is composed of light greenish gray, greenish gray, and light olive-gray (5Y 6/2) nannofossil ooze with or without foraminifers.  

Moderate to strong bioturbation is the only secondary sedimentary structure observed and is widespread throughout the sequence. Discrete ichnofossil burrows were commonly observed, often surrounded by thin darker bands. The occurrence of intervals rich i n sand-sized quartz and foraminifers further suggests the depositio n of contourites and/or turbidites.  

# Physical properties  

At Site U1479, the lithology is homogeneous and has been classified as one lithologic unit. All high-resolution physical propert y records derived by core logging show similar cyclic changes that ar e likely related to the lithologic alternations within this nannofossil ooze between intervals of more or less terrigenous content and thu s may reflect changes in ocean circulation and/or terrigenous supply. Also, the changes in general physical property trends broadly correlate between the parameters. A slump in the lowermost part o f Site U1479 is characterized by physical properties that are distinctl y different from the rest of the cored section.  

# Micropaleontology  

Biostratigraphy of calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and diatoms indicates that Hole U1479B spans the late Pleistocene to the late Miocene with a bottom age of ${\sim}7\mathrm{~Ma}$ . Calcareou s microfossils include primarily subtropical convergence and coastal - to slope-water taxa with minor abundances of warm subtropical and subpolar taxa. Diatoms are mostly composed of subtropical taxa with a minor presence of Southern Ocean taxa in the Pleistocene and subtropical taxa in the early Pliocene and latest Miocene. Planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils are abundan t throughout Site U1479, whereas diatoms make episodic appearances, particularly in the upper and lower parts of the record. Preservation is good to moderate for calcareous taxa and moderate t o poor for diatoms. The biochronology for both calcareous microfossil groups and diatoms is consistent with an average sedimentatio n rate of ${\sim}4.9\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ .  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic analyses were carried out on archive halves fro m Site U1479 and on discrete samples from Hole U1479B. The inclination and declination data from the archive halves are relativel y noisy, which might be partially explained by the alteration of magnetic minerals as suggested by downhole records of various roc k magnetic parameters including the Sr ratio, HIRM, and SIRM. Additionally, magnetic susceptibility is very low for most of the downhole record. Inclinations and declinations show an interval o f normal polarity in the uppermost ${\sim}55~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Brunhes Chron), although the lower boundary is deeper than would be anticipate d from the biostratigraphy. A distinct interval of reversed polarity between ${\sim}55$ and ${\sim}125\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A is probably the Matuyama Chron, which spans from ${\sim}2.6$ to $3.6\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Unlike the Brunhes/Matuyam a Chron boundary, the inferred Matuyama/Gauss Chron boundary i s in agreement with ages derived from the biostratigraphy. Additional paleomagnetic analyses on rock magnetic properties and directional data are necessary to constrain and eventually refine the magnetostratigraphy for Site U1479.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Stratigraphic correlation of Holes U1479B–U1479I was complicated by very low magnetic susceptibility and adverse weather conditions resulting in several partial core recoveries in all the holes, a s well as soupy top sections that were generally unusable for stratigraphy. Notwithstanding, the NGR and color (e.g., RGB green) records display clear variability in all undisturbed core sections, making the alignment of cores relatively straightforward once al l scanning was complete. Furthermore, comparatively constant offsets between cores in Holes U1479B and U1479C led to the development of a robust and nearly complete splice from just below th e mudline to the bottom of Hole U1479B at ${\sim}300\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The generally clear stratigraphic relationship between Holes U1479B an d U1479C only needed refinement and supplementation in scattere d discrete intervals.  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water chemistry and headspace gas concentration s indicate moderate early sediment diagenesis. Major element concentrations show some evidence of uptake into clay minerals an d precipitation of authigenic carbonates. There is no clear sulfate– methane transition zone in Hole U1479B—sulfate concentration s are zero at ${\sim}185\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, but methane concentrations are neve r above ${\sim}50$ ppmv. Other redox-sensitive elements, such as iron an d barium, show more dramatic enrichments, with iron reaching ${\sim}15$ $\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at ${\sim}60\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and barium reaching ${\sim}600\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at ${\sim}150\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF}.$ - A. Calcium carbonate ranges from ${\sim}51$ to $91~\mathrm{wt\%}$ , with an averag e value of $67\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ and no distinct trend downhole. Organic carbo n ranges between 0.15 and $1.93\mathrm{~wt}\%$ with an average value of 0.6 2 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ .  

# Expedition synthesis and preliminary scientific assessment  

The greater Agulhas Current system is a key location to stud y past ocean circulation and climate, as it represents a significan t component of the global thermohaline circulation, carrying surfac e water into the Atlantic that compensates for the export of deep water from the Atlantic Basin to the world ocean. This Agulhas leakag e transfer of salt to the South Atlantic variably impacts the buoyanc y structure there and likely contributes to mode changes and variability of the AMOC and thus climate variability in the North Atlanti c region and beyond. Additionally, variations in Agulhas warm-wate r transports along the southeast African continental margin foste r exchanges of heat and moisture with the atmosphere that influenc e southern Africa regional climates.  

Operations during Expedition 361 drilled six sites in the southwest Indian Ocean from February to March 2016 (Figure F3). In total, we recovered $5175\;\mathrm{m}$ of core, with an average recovery of $102\%$ , during 29.7 days of on-site operations, from a region poorly represented in the database of drill sites for scientific purposes. No hole s were logged. This is considerably less than the initially planne d campaign targeting $5811\;\mathrm{m}$ of section, including downhole loggin g at four sites (Hall et al., 2015). The difference amounts to ${\sim}11$ day s of lost operational time. A medical evacuation accounted for 1. 8 days and weather a further 1.5 days of lost operations. The remainder of the lost operational time was due to delays in attaining th e necessary permissions to operate in Mozambique exclusive economic zone (EEZ) waters, which necessitated a revision of the drilling plan and $2840\,\mathrm{nmi}$ of additional transit to Expedition 361.  

Expedition 361 South African Climates (Agulhas LGM Densit y Profile) had the following five fundamental objectives:  

• To establish the sensitivity of the Agulhas Current to changing climates of the Pliocene–Pleistocene in association with transient to long-term changes of high-latitude climates, tropical heat budgets, and the monsoon system;   
• To determine the dynamics of the Indian-Atlantic ocean gateway circulation during such climate changes in association with changing wind fields and migrating ocean fronts;   
• To examine the connection between Agulhas leakage and ensuing buoyancy transfer and shifts of the AMOC during major ocean and climate reorganizations during at least the last 5 my;   
• To address the impact of Agulhas variability on southern Africa terrestrial climates and, notably, rainfall patterns and river runoff; and   
• To constrain the temperature, salinity, and density structure of the LGM deep ocean from the bottom of the ocean to the base of the main thermocline.  

The expedition made major strides toward fulfilling each o f these objectives. The recovered sequences allowed complete splice d sections to be generated that span the interval of 0 to between ${\sim}0.13$ and $7\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Figure F11). The sedimentological characteristics (Figures F12, F13, F14) range from highly terrigenous near the Zambez i (Site U1477) and Limpopo (Site U1478) Rivers and in the Natal Valley (Site U1474) to very carbonate rich in the northern Mozambiqu e Channel (Site U1476), the Agulhas Plateau (Site U1475), and Cap e Basin (Site U1479). The carbonate fossil preservation is good in th e Pleistocene and mostly good to moderate, tending to be a littl e worse near the bottoms of each sequence (Figures F15, F16). Biostratigraphies from nannofossils and foraminifers are quite goo d (Figures F17, F18). At Sites U1475 and U1479, diatoms are abundant enough to provide further biostratigraphic constraints, and a t these sites there is potential for future paleoenvironmental wor k with diatoms (Figure F19). All the fossils showed a mixture of tropical and subtropical convergence and temperate or subpolar specie s in the southernmost sites (Figures F19, F20, F21), and change s through time in these assemblages will provide important constraints on the dynamics of the Agulhas Current system. For Site s U1475, U1476, U1478, and U1479, sea conditions and time wer e sufficient that geochemical compositions were measured on a suit e of solid bulk samples from the carbonate sample residue. As Ba/Al ratios may be a good X-ray fluorescence proxy for productivity, Figure F22 displays the $\mathrm{Ba}/\mathrm{Al}$ ratios of bulk samples against TOC. Sit e U1477, with an extremely high terrigenous load, shows no correlation and has $\mathrm{Ba}/\mathrm{Al}$ ratios of typical silicate detritus. Site U1478 als o has mostly terrigenous $\mathrm{Ba}/\mathrm{Al}$ ratios, but a few samples stand above. Site U1476 is in an area of low productivity, so the range of Ba/Al ratios is low and not correlated with TOC. However, it is elevate d above terrigenous, indicating at least $50\%$ of the Ba is probably fro m biogenic sources. Site U1475, located on the Agulhas Plateau wher e we would expect variations with the position of the STF, has hig h $\mathrm{Ba}/\mathrm{Al}$ ratios and has a generally strong positive trend with TO C with the exception of a couple of samples.  

Early sediment diagenesis, driven by microbial respiration of organic matter in sediment, defines many dissolved elemental profiles. One of the characteristic profiles that indicates the extent an d intensity of these reactions is dissolved sulfate (Figure F23). Wher e microbial respiration is intense as a result organic matter availabilit y sulfate is rapidly consumed. Where microbial respiration is mor e moderate sulfate decreases at a slower rate and sometimes persist s to the base of the measured interval. We see a range of diageneti c intensities across the Expedition 361 sites, with the most intens e microbial activity and diagenesis at Site U1477 (Zambezi) and th e least activity at Site U1476 (Mozambique Channel). It is likely tha t the observed differences between sites are driven by location an d sedimentation rate rather than organic carbon content becaus e TOC does not vary between sites (Figure F14).  

Operations at Site U1474 (Natal Valley; Figure F3) were scheduled to produce three APC/XCB holes to $300\,\mathrm{~m~}$ below seafloo r (mbsf), with logging in one of the deep holes and a single hole t o 150 mbsf for interstitial water samples. This drilling objective wa s largely accomplished with the exception of logging and a reductio n in the target section depth to $254\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A because of loss of operational time as noted above. Recovery was excellent, and triple-coring allowed compilation of a complete spliced record extending t o the latest Miocene $\left({\sim}6.2\ \mathrm{Ma}\right)$ . The site boasts an excellent paleomagnetic timescale (Figure F23) that is in good agreement with th e biostratigraphy, and these together suggest uniform sedimentatio n rates of ${\sim}4.1\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ over most of the sequence and an apparent increase near the bottom (Figure F11). This record represents th e only site situated beneath the main flow of the fully constitute d Agulhas Current and will therefore provide the opportunity fo r high-resolution climate reconstructions of Agulhas Current warmwater transports and upstream variability that may allow the identification of connections between Agulhas leakage and its headwate r variability. The site also holds significant potential to investigate th e connections between southern African terrestrial climates an d southeast Indian Ocean heat budgets and notably the links to th e cultural evolution of early modern humans. A high-resolution program of interstitial water samples, collected from a $150\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF- A section, will provide an additional data point to the presently available pore water LGM temperature and salinity inventory.  

Operations at Site U1475 (Agulhas Plateau; Figure F3) wer e scheduled for three APC/XCB holes to 300 mbsf with logging and  a single hole to 150 mbsf for interstitial water samples. This drillin g objective was largely accomplished with the exception of logging. Recovery was excellent, and multiple coring, including some spo t coring caused by weather-related disturbances, allowed compilatio n of a complete spliced record extending to the late Miocene $\left({\sim}7\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ The paleomagnetic timescale is robust to the base of the Mammot h Chron $\mathrm{{[C2An.2r}}$ at $99\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A) (Figure F23) and is in goo d agreement with the biostratigraphy, but the overprint was too muc h to take the paleomagnetic timescale to the bottom. Age estimate s suggest sedimentation rates of ${\sim}2.9\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the uppermost $115\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A, $10.3\,\mathrm{\cm/ky}$ between 115 and $255\,\mathrm{~m~}\,\mathrm{CCSF-A}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , and 2. 8 $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ between $255\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ and the bottom of the section (Figure F11). This record will provide the opportunity for high-resolution climate reconstructions of the Agulhas Return Current an d connections with the STF, productivity, and deep-water circulation. A high-resolution program of interstitial water samples, collecte d from a $150~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A section, will provide an additional data poin t to the presently available interstitial water LGM temperature an d salinity inventory.  

Operations at Site U1476 (Mozambique Channel; Figure F3 ) were scheduled for three APC/XCB holes to 300 mbsf with loggin g and a single hole to 150 mbsf for interstitial water samples. Thi s drilling objective was largely accomplished with the exception o f logging and a reduction in the target depth to $220\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A becaus e of loss of operational time as noted above. Recovery was excellent, and triple coring allowed compilation of a complete spliced recor d extending to the late Miocene $({\sim}6.9\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . The site boasts excellen t biostratigraphy and notably cyclic physical properties. The paleomagnetic reversal signal was complicated by apparent cyclicall y varying magnetic mineralogy and will require shore-based work t o try to extract a paleomagnetic timescale at this site (Figure F23) . The sedimentation rate is ${\sim}2.2\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ from the mudline to ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A and $3.8\;\mathrm{{cm/ky}}$ from ${\sim}50\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ to the bottom (Figur e F11). This site is located on Davie Ridge at the northern end of th e Mozambique Channel in a region with low productivity and wit h equilibrium ocean-atmosphere $C O_{2}$ . The site will therefore provid e the opportunity for high-resolution reconstructions of tropical faunal assemblages that will allow identification of connections between Agulhas leakage and its headwater variability. The site als o holds significant potential to investigate the connections betwee n southern African terrestrial climates and southeast Indian Ocea n heat budgets and thermocline and deep-water variability with likel y links to the development of the Indonesian Throughflow as well a s aridification of east Africa. Foraminifers show excellent preservation, thus also making this an ideal site for a long record of surfaceocean pH from boron isotopes. A high-resolution program of interstitial water samples collected from a $150\mathrm{\;m\,CSF-A}$ section will provide an additional data point to the presently available interstitial water LGM temperature and salinity inventory.  

Operations at Site U1477 (Zambezi Catchment; Figure F3) wer e scheduled for three APC/XCB holes to 207 mbsf. This drilling objective was modified to end at APC refusal, which led to recoverin g ${\sim}166\;\mathrm{m}$ . Recovery was excellent, and triple coring allowed compilation of a complete spliced record to ${\sim}85\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ . The magneti c susceptibility signal is strong and could be matched to nearby $^{14}\mathrm{C}_{^{-}}$ dated cores, and two biostratigraphic markers, in agreement, pointed to sediment accumulation rates of ${\sim}1~\mathrm{m/ky}$ at this site (Figure F11). This extreme accumulation rate was a surprise and led t o only recovering ${\sim}120\,\mathrm{~ky~}$ of sediment record from the Zambez i Catchment. Therefore, the sediment record will not allow a $2\ \mathrm{my}$ record as planned, but will instead, for example, provide the opportunity for extremely high resolution reconstructions of terrestrial climate and thermocline characteristics during the last glacial cycle. The site also holds significant potential to investigate the connections between southern African terrestrial climates and southeas t Indian Ocean heat budgets and notably the links to the cultural evolution of modern humans.  

Operations at Site U1478 (Limpopo Catchment; Figure F3) wer e scheduled to be three APC/XCB holes to 180 mbsf, with a permitted depth to 250 mbsf, and a single hole to 150 mbsf for interstitial waters. This drilling objective was successfully accomplished, an d coring was taken to the maximum allowed depth of $250~\mathrm{m}$ CSF- A with APC, until refusal, followed by HLAPC coring. Recovery wa s excellent, and triple coring allowed compilation of a complet e spliced record extending to ${\sim}4\mathrm{~Ma}$ . The paleomagnetic timescal e was robust for the uppermost ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, below which the signal appears to be badly modified by diagenesis (Figure F23). Th e magnetic reversal positions are in good agreement with the biostratigraphy, and these together suggest a sedimentation rate of ${\sim}9.3$ $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ from the mudline to ${\sim}200\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ and rate of $2.8\;\mathrm{{cm/ky}}$ from ${\sim}200\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ to the bottom of the site (Figure F11). This record will provide the opportunity for high-resolution climate reconstructions of faunal, biogeochemical, and terrigenous tracers tha t are characteristic of the upper reaches of the Agulhas Curren t warm-water transports that will allow connections between Agulhas leakage and its headwater variability. The site also holds significant potential to investigate the connections between souther n African terrestrial climates and southeast Indian Ocean heat budgets and notably the links to the cultural evolution of early moder n humans. A high-resolution program of interstitial water sample s collected from a $150\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A section will provide an additiona l data point to the presently available interstitial water LGM temperature and salinity inventory.  

Operations at Site U1479 (Cape Basin; Figure F3) were scheduled for three APC/XCB holes to 350 mbsf with logging. This drilling objective was largely accomplished with the exception of loggin g and a reduction in the target section depth to ${\sim}300\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A because of time constraints and the biostratigraphy indication that w e had achieved the temporal goal. Recovery was excellent, and multiple coring (with extra cores taken because of messy intervals relate d to large ocean swells) allowed compilation of a complete spliced record extending to ${\sim}7\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Although the signal is low and therefor e will need future work on shore, the paleomagnetic timescale (Figur e F23) is in good agreement with the biostratigraphy, and these together suggest uniform sedimentation rates of ${\sim}4.3\mathrm{\cm/ky}$ throug h the sequence (Figure F11). This record represents the only site situated in the immediate Agulhas leakage pathway. It will therefor e provide the opportunity for high-resolution climate reconstruction s of the leakage and temporal comparisons with deep-water circulation.  

The following specific scientific objectives of the expedition ar e expected to be highly achievable with the materials covered:  

• To determine the variability of the greater Agulhas Current system under contrasting climatic regimes: early Pliocene warm conditions, during the mid-Pliocene expansion of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, and through the MPT;   
• To establish the role of Agulhas leakage in transient and longterm shifts of the AMOC during these climatic transitions: proxy records of mode/strength of Agulhas leakage during periods of major climatic reorganizations and for AMOC variations through the same intervals;   
• To establish the response of the Agulhas Current system to Antarctic climate variability and bipolar linkages: evidence for variation of the Agulhas leakage in highly resolved temporal records will be compared to Antarctic and bipolar climate changes as well as with evidence for shifts of Southern Ocean fronts bordering the Agulhas corridor at the southern tip of Africa and strength of the westerlies;   
• To understand the remote tropical origins of Agulhas Current variability: evidence for variation of Agulhas leakage in highly resolved temporal records will be compared to records of Indonesian Throughflow and monsoon modulation on the Agulhas Current source region and impacts on warm-water and saltwater transports along the southeast African margin and IndianAtlantic saltwater leakage;   
• To better determine southern African climate sensitivity: comparison of varying Agulhas Current warm-water transports with rainfall patterns in southern Africa in connection with the Pliocene–Pleistocene evolution of tropical climates, ITCZ migration, and tectonic history of eastern Africa; and   
• To provide further verification of glacial–interglacial variations in the Southern Ocean’s role in the carbon cycle: nutrient cycling, productivity, and $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ and their role in global biogeochemical cycles.  

# Drilling operations and core handling  

Drilling operations and core handling were performed, as i s widely acknowledged for IODP, with total professionalism and wit h outstanding commitment to achieving the expedition scientific objectives. As a result, materials recovered during Expedition 36 1 were accordingly astonishing and promise significant future scientific research, including full-recovery APC coring to deeper tha n $300\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A at Site U1479; complete APC records through the lat e Miocene/early Pliocene to recent at Sites U1474–U1476, U1478, and U1479; and 382 interstitial water samples from Sites U1474– U1476 and U1478 to help constrain the temperature, salinity, an d density structure of the LGM spanning from 488 to 3045 mbsl. A t Site U1477, where degassing within the core barrel was experienced, appropriate core handling adjustments were implemente d rapidly, preserving the scientific value of the cored sections. In summary, the exceptional skills of the drillers and core technicians wer e the main reason why, despite setbacks, the scientific objectives o f Expedition 361 could be accomplished.  

# Critical aspects  

# Administrative preparation for operations within Mozambique EEZ waters  

The majority of the lost operational time was due to delays in attaining the necessary permissions to operate in Mozambique EEZ waters (received some 48 days after the expedition start). These issues should be addressed and resolved prior to an expedition so as not to impact operational time and thereby jeopardize the scientific impact of the recovered material. Although such issues are relatively rare, in this case Expedition 361 had to compensate by dropping all of the planned logging operations and shortening holes (i.e., exclude XCB drilling) to ensure complete APC spliced records to target stratigraphic depths were obtained at all sites for the palaoceanographic objectives and the interstitial water program, in support of the APL (Agulhas LGM Density Profile), were met. Fortunately, smooth coring operations, sequence characteristics, and a clement sea state for much of the expedition worked in our favor to produce $100\%$ recovery. This will serve to reduce the negative impact of lost operational time.  

# Operations  

During Expedition 361, we conducted coring operations in 3 5 holes at 6 sites. A total of $422.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ was drilled without recovery, $5080.4\mathrm{~m~}$ was cored, and $5175.69\mathrm{~m~}$ of core was recovered ( $102\%$ total core recovery) (Table T1). The overall time distribution included 4.9 days in port, 26.3 days in transit, and 29.7 days on site. The vessel transited a total of $6752\;\mathrm{nmi}$ .  

# Port Louis port call  

IODP Expedition 361 began at $1014\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{UTC}+4)$ on 30 Januar y 2016 with the first line ashore at Quay A Mer Rouge in Port Louis, Mauritius. The IODP staff and chief scientists boarded the vessel a t $1100\,\mathrm{h}$ , and the off-going science party departed at $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ . Port call activities started with the IODP staff crew change and crossover; off-going staff departed the vessel at $1500\,\mathrm{h}$ . The Siem crew crossover took place on 31 January, and the science party boarded th e vessel that morning.  

On 4 February the vessel was made ready for the sea passage . The port call ended with last line away at $0736~\mathrm{h}$ . With the assistance from two harbor tugs, the vessel left Port Louis. The pilot departed the vessel at $0808~\mathrm{h}$ . The propeller speed was increased t o $140~\mathrm{rpm},$ , and the R/V JOIDES Resolution began the sea passage t o the first site (proposed Site MZC-01C) of Expedition 361.  

# Transit to Site U1474  

The original operations plan called for the ship to transit to proposed Site MZC-01C (Site U1476) to begin coring operations. However,  the  ship  had  not  been  cleared  to  operate  within  th e Mozambique EEZ, and on 6 February 2016 the decision was mad e to go to Site U1474 (proposed Site NV-02C), which is located withi n the South Africa EEZ. After a $1563\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Port Louis averaging $11.3\;\mathrm{kt}.$ , the vessel arrived at Site U1474 at $2330\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{(UTC+2}$ h) on 9 February. Given the location of Site U1474 within the Agulhas Current, surface current speeds were high throughout operations, averaging ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ .  

# Site U1474  

Site U1474 consisted of 8 holes, ranging in depth from 3.1 t o $254.1\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Overall, 111 cores were recorded for the site. A total o f $809.79\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over a $794.0\ \mathrm{m}$ interval was recovered using th e APC system ( $102\%$ core recovery). The HLAPC system was used t o core a $102.4~\mathrm{m}$ interval, and $100.96\mathrm{~m~}$ of core was recovered $(99\%$ core recovery). A total of $910.75\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment was recovered fro m a $896.4\mathrm{~m~}$ interval at Site U1474 ( $102\%$ core recovery). The tota l time spent at Site U1474 was 7.6 days.  

# Hole U1474A  

The drill string was run to a depth of 3025.2 mbsl. The top driv e was picked up and the bit was placed at $3042.6~\mathrm{mbsl}$ for the firs t APC core. The core barrel was retrieved completely full, missing th e sediment/water interface at the seafloor. The bit was raised $7.9\:\mathrm{m}$ t o 3034.7 mbsl for a second coring attempt. This also yielded a full cor e barrel. These two cores were later curated as Cores 361-U1474G1H and 361-U1474H-1H. The bit was raised $5\;\mathrm{m}$ to 3029.7 mbsl fo r a third coring attempt at $1525\,\mathrm{h}$ . This core retrieved a good mudlin e core.  

Cores 361-U1474A-1H through 27H were successfully recovered using the APC. After four partial strokes using the APC, th e HLAPC was deployed for Cores 28F through 29F. After reaching th e HLAPC refusal depth at 254.1 mbsf, the drill string was pulled ou t of the hole. The bit cleared the seafloor at $1040~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 February, ending Hole U1474A.  

A total of 27 APC cores were taken over a $244.9\;\mathrm{m}$ interval wit h a total recovery of $256.11\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $105\%$ core recovery). Tw o HLAPC cores were retrieved over a $9.2\textrm{m}$ interval with $8.72~\mathrm{m}$ recovered $(95\%)$ . Total core recovery for Hole U1474A was $104\%$ .  

# Hole U1474B  

The vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ north of Hole U1474A, and coring i n Hole U1474B started at $1320\,\mathrm{h}$ on 12 February. Cores 361-U1474B1H through 16H penetrated to $147.3~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $142.09\;\mathrm{m}$ o f sediment $96\%$ core recovery). One interstitial water whole-roun d sample was taken from each core section for high-resolution geochemistry. After reaching the total depth at $147.3\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF, the dril l string was pulled out of the hole. The bit cleared the seafloor at 083 5 h on 13 February.  

# Hole U1474C  

The vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1474A, and coring i n Hole U1474C started at $0935\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 February. Core 361-U1474C1H was recovered with $3.07\textrm{m}$ of sediment. The stratigraphic correlation specialists determined that a longer first core was needed t o span stratigraphic gaps, and Hole U1474C was terminated.  

# Hole U1474D  

The ship maintained its position $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1474A, an d coring started in Hole U1474D at $1100~\mathrm{h}$ on 13 February. Hol e U1474D was cored to $124.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF using the APC system. At 0215 h on 14 February, winds increased to $50\;\mathrm{kt}$ , gusting up to $58~\mathrm{kt}$ , an d combined with a ${\sim}2$ kt surface current led to the dynamic positioning system (DPS) operating at $100\%$ capacity. The drill string wa s pulled out of the hole, and the bit cleared the seafloor at $0305\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 14 February, ending Hole U1474D. The final depth of Hole U1474 D was $124.5~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Cores 361-U1474D-1H through 14H were take n over a $124.5\;\mathrm{m}$ interval and recovered $126.04\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment ( $101\%$ core recovery).  

# Hole U1474E  

The vessel drifted at $0.9~\mathrm{\textbf{kt}}$ southward after ending Hol e U1474D. At $1900~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 February, the thrusters were raised t o transit back to Site U1474. Hole U1474E was spudded $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east o f Hole U1474A at $0725\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 February. The hole was drilled without coring to $105.5\:\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Cores 361-U1474E-2H through 9H wer e recovered using the APC system to $172.0\:\mathrm{m}$ . One drilled interval between 124.5 and 126.0 mbsf was used to aid in stratigraphic correlation. The HLAPC was deployed for Cores 10F through 19F. Afte r recovering Core 19F, the drill string was pulled out of the hole. Th e bit cleared the seafloor at $0630\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 16 February, ending Hol e U1474E. The final depth of Hole U1474E was $219.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF.  

A total of 7 APC cores were taken over a $65.0~\mathrm{m}$ interval with  a total recovery of $67.93\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $105\%$ core recovery). Ten HLAP C cores were retrieved over a $47.0~\mathrm{m}$ interval with $46.51\;\mathrm{m}$ recovere d $99\%$ core recovery). Two drilled intervals over $107~\mathrm{m}$ were logged. The total core recovery for Hole U1474E was $102\%$ .  

# Hole U1474F  

The vessel was offset $20\textrm{m}$ south of Hole U1474Am and Hol e U1474F started at $0845\mathrm{~h~}$ on 16 February. Cores 361-U1474F-1 H through 21H were retrieved using the APC system. After experiencing partial strokes while taking Cores 20H and 21H, the HLAP C system was deployed for Cores 22F through 24F. Following Cor e 24F, the stratigraphic correlation specialists requested a $2.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ drilled interval (361-U1474F-251) to offset the coring gaps. Corin g operations with the HLAPC continued through Core 33F, wher e APC refusal depth was reached at $238.4\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The drill string wa s pulled out of the hole, and the bit cleared the seafloor at $0400\,\mathrm{h}$ an d cleared the rotary table at $0745~\mathrm{h}$ on 18 February. The rig was the n secured for transit. Permission to drill in the Mozambique EEZ ha d still not been received, so the decision was made to sail south. Th e vessel began the transit to proposed Site APT-01B (U1475) at 094 8 h on 18 February, ending Hole U1474F and Site U1474.  

A total of 21 APC cores were taken over a $190.2\;\mathrm{m}$ interval wit h a total recovery of $194.76\mathrm{~m~}$ of core ( $102\%$ core recovery). Eleve n HLAPC cores were retrieved over a $46.2~\mathrm{m}$ interval with $45.73\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered $99\%$ core recovery). One interval of $2.0\,\textrm{m}$ was drille d without coring. A total of $241.3\:\mathrm{m}$ of sediment was recovered over  a $236.4\:\mathrm{m}$ cored interval ( $102\%$ core recovery) in Hole U1474F.  

# Holes U1474G and U1474H  

Cores 361-U1474G-1H and 361-U1474H-1H were retrieve d prior to the start of Hole U1474A. Core 361-U1474G-1H was sho t ${\sim}13~\mathrm{m}$ below the sediment/water interface and recovered $9.97\;\mathrm{m}$ o f sediment. Core 361-U1474H-1H was shot $_{0.3\mathrm{~m~}}$ below the sediment/water interface and recovered $9.82\textrm{m}$ of sediment. The science leadership decided that the greatest scientific value of Cor e 361-U1474G-1H would come from leaving it on the vessel for futur e science parties to train with.  

# Transit to Site U1475  

The vessel was under way at full speed for Site U1475 (propose d Site APT-01B) when the ship’s doctor informed the Captain of  a medical emergency requiring evacuation. The ship’s heading wa s changed at $0820~\mathrm{h}$ on 20 February 2016 to meet a helicopter fo r evacuation near Port Elizabeth, South Africa. At ${\sim}1200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 February, the vessel was in position for a helicopter transfer. By $1230\,\mathrm{h},$ the helicopter departed with the patient and the vessel resumed th e transit to Site U1475. After a $433\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from the medical evacuation point, the vessel arrived at Site U1475 at $1500\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 February.  

# Site U1475  

Site U1475 consisted of 6 holes, ranging in depth from 1.5 t o $277.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Overall, 107 cores were recorded for the site. A total o f $1015.92\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over a $987.9\mathrm{~m~}$ interval was recovered using th e APC system ( $103\%$ core recovery). Six intervals were advance d without coring over $86.0~\mathrm{m}$ . The total time spent at Site U1475 wa s 5.7 days.  

# Hole U1475A  

The vessel arrived at Site U1475 at $1500\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 February 2016. Core 361-U1475A-1H was recovered with $1.48~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment, an d sea level was determined to be $2670.4\mathrm{~m~}$ above the sediment surface. The science party decided that a longer, well-preserved mudline core was necessary, and Hole U1475A was concluded. On e APC core was taken over a $1.5\textrm{m}$ interval with a total recovery o f $1.48~\mathrm{m}$ of core $(99\%$ core recovery).  

# Hole U1475B  

Hole U1475B began at $0330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 February. The APC was deployed for Cores 361-U1475B-1H through 26H from the seafloor t o $243.9\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The drill string was pulled out of the hole, and operations in Hole U1475B ended when the bit cleared the seafloor a t $0430~\mathrm{h}$ on 25 February. A total of 26 APC cores were taken over  a $243.9\,\mathrm{m}$ interval with $250.31\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment recovered $(103\%)$ . Core s 1H through 6H ( $0{-}54.13\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) are extremely disturbed as a result of the high seas.  

# Hole U1475C  

The vessel was moved $20\;\mathrm{m}$ north of Hole U1475B. APC corin g in Hole U1475C started at $0625\ \mathrm{h}$ on 25 February and extende d from the seafloor $(2669.3~\mathrm{\mbsl})$ to $275.0\;\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. Cores 361- U1475C-1H through 30H were taken over a $272.0\;\mathrm{m}$ cored interva l with $280.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment recovered $(103\%)$ . While taking Cores 3 H and 12H, the shear pins on the core barrel sheared early due t o rough sea conditions. A short interval from 148.5 to $151.5~\mathrm{m}$ DS F was advanced without coring as requested by the stratigraphic correlation specialists to cover coring gaps. After reaching $275.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF, the drill string was pulled out of the hole and operations i n Hole U1475C ended when the bit cleared the seafloor at $0935\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 26 February.  

# Hole U1475D  

The vessel was moved $20\,\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1475B. Coring in Hol e U1475D began at $1155\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 February and extended from the seafloor to $143.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. Cores 361-U1475D-1H through 16H wer e taken over a $143.0\ \mathrm{m}$ interval with $150.86\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment recovere d $(105\%)$ . Interstitial water samples were collected from every cor e section for postcruise research. After concluding coring operation s in Hole U1475D, the drill string was pulled out of the hole, with th e bit clearing the seafloor at $0425\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 February.  

# Hole U1475E  

The vessel was offset $20\,\textrm{m}$ south of Hole U1475B, and Hol e U1475E began at $0550\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 27 February. APC coring in Hol e U1475E extended from the seafloor $(2671.8~\mathrm{mbsl})$ to $277.0\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF. Cores 361-U1475E-1H through 30H were taken over a $270.5\mathrm{~m~}$ interval with $277.20\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment recovered $(102\%)$ . One interval was advanced without coring from 119.0 to $125.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF as was requested by the stratigraphic correlation specialists to offset corin g gaps. After reaching $277.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, the drill string was pulled out o f the hole, and operations in Hole U1475E ended when the bit cleare d the seafloor at $1335\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 February.  

# Hole U1475F  

The vessel was offset $20\,\mathrm{m}$ west of Hole U1475B, and operation s in Hole U1475F began at $1450~\mathrm{h}$ on 28 February. The stratigraphi c correlation specialists devised a spot-coring plan in Hole U1475F t o cover large coring gaps. The hole was washed down from the seafloor $\mathrm{2669.3\,mbsl)}$ to $20\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Hole U1475F contained four intervals that were advanced without coring over $76.5~\mathrm{m}$ . Six APC core s were recovered over a $57.0\;\mathrm{m}$ interval using nonmagnetic core barrels in Hole U1475F, with $55.37\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment recovered ( $97\%$ cor e recovery). After reaching $133.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF, the drill sting was pulle d from the hole, with the bit clearing the seafloor at $0235\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 February. The beacon was recovered at $0451~\mathrm{h},$ and the drill floor wa s secured for transit. At $0930~\mathrm{h}$ the vessel began the voyage to proposed Site ZAM-05A (U1477), ending Site U1475.  

# Transit to Site U1476  

After completing operations at Site U1475, the vessel initiall y transited toward proposed Site ZAM-05A. However, after not receiving clearance to operate within the Mozambique EEZ by the en d of the day on 2 March 2016, the decision was made at $^{1730\,\mathrm{h}}$ to hal t the transit to Site U1477 and abandon the Mozambique sites.

The vessel spent the remaining operational time waiting o n weather. At $0400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 March the drill pipe was tripped, and th e bit cleared the rig floor at $1215~\mathrm{h}$ . The positioning beacon was recovered at $0754~\mathrm{h}$ . The rig floor was secured for transit at $1335~\mathrm{h},$ , the thrusters were raised at $1415\,\mathrm{h},$ and the vessel was under way t o Cape Town, South Africa, at $1436~\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1479I and Sit e U1479.

Figure F1. Global composite of land surface reflectance and sea-surface temperature (credit: Jacques Descloitres, MODIS Land Science Team, NASA) with schematic representation of the greater Agulhas Current system and its links to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The greater Agulhas Current system around South Africa consists of the Agulhas Current flowing south along the African shelf. Off the southern tip of Africa, the Agulhas Current abruptl y retroflects and feeds back into the Indian Ocean. During this process, huge rings of water (Agulhas rings) are separated, drifting into the Atlantic. Upstream o f the Agulhas Current, eddies around Madagascar insert short-term variability into the Agulhas Current, leading to short-term offshore meanders of the mai n current by several 100 km.

Figure F12. Summary of major lithologic characteristics of sediment cores , Sites U1474–U1479. Sites U1474, U1477, and U1478 are characterized by terrigenous sedimentation with carbonate content between 5 and $37.5~{\mathsf{w t}}\%$ . Sites U1475, U1476, and U1479 are characterized by pelagic sedimentatio n with carbonate content between 58 and $80~{\mathsf{W t}}\%$ . Sediment color range s from white-gray (Site U1475) to greenish gray (Sites U1474, U1476, an d U1479) and dark gray (Sites U1477 and U1478). Slight to moderate bioturbation occurs at Sites U1476–U1478, whereas strong bioturbation marks th e sediment at Sites U1474, U1475, and U1479. Sandy layers $/{\sim}0.5\;\mathsf{c m}$ to ${\sim}2\;\mathsf{m}$ thick) at Sites U1474, U1478, and U1479 are interpreted as contourite and/o r turbidite deposits.

Figure F15. Summary of calcareous nannofossil preservation and reworking at Expedition 361 drill sites for the Pleistocene, Pliocene, and Miocene. Nannofossi l preservation score is based on ratings of good, moderate, and poor to illustrate changes in preservation through time. Qualitative percentages of nannofossi l group (red) and reworked species (green) abundances are indicated on the right with relative latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates for each site. Missin g charts from different time periods are due to the negligible number of reworked species at that site. Site U1477 sequence covers only the Pleistocene; reworked species are sparsely recorded and nannofossil abundance varies throughout the site and increases latitudinally within time intervals. The grou p abundances for the other sites are high during the three time intervals.
