# Abstract  

The marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is currently locally retreating because of shifting wind-driven oceanic currents that transport warm waters toward the ice margin, resulting in ice shelf thinning and accelerated mass loss. Previous results from geologic drilling on Antarctica’s continental margins show significant variability in ice sheet extent during the late Neogene and Quaternary. Climate and ice sheet models indicate a fundamental role for oceanic heat in controlling ice sheet variability over at least the past 20 My. Although evidence for past ice sheet variability is available from ice-proximal marine settings, sedimentary sequences from the continental shelf and rise are required to evaluate the extent of past ice sheet variability and the associated forcings and feedbacks. International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 374 drilled a latitudinal and depth transect of five sites from the outer continental shelf to rise in the central Ross Sea to resolve Neogene and Quaternary relationships between climatic and oceanic change and WAIS evolution. The Ross Sea was targeted because numerical ice sheet models indicate that this sector of Antarctica responds sensitively to changes in ocean heat flux. Expedition 374 was designed for optimal data-model integration to enable an improved understanding of Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) mass balance during warmer-than-present climates (e.g., the Pleistocene “super interglacials,” the mid-Pliocene, and the Miocene Climatic Optimum). The principal goals of Expedition 374 were to  

• Evaluate the contribution of West Antarctica to far-field ice volume and sea level estimates;  

• Reconstruct ice-proximal oceanic and atmospheric temperatures to quantify past polar amplification;   
• Assess the role of oceanic forcing (e.g., temperature and sea level) on AIS variability;   
• Identify the sensitivity of the AIS to Earth’s orbital configuration under a variety of climate boundary conditions; and   
• Reconstruct Ross Sea paleobathymetry to examine relationships between seafloor geometry, ice sheet variability, and global climate.  

# To achieve these objectives, postcruise studies will  

• Use data and models to reconcile intervals of maximum Neogene and Quaternary ice advance and retreat with far-field records of eustatic sea level;   
• Reconstruct past changes in oceanic and atmospheric temperatures using a multiproxy approach;   
• Reconstruct Neogene and Quaternary sea ice margin fluctuations and correlate these records to existing inner continental shelf records;   
• Examine relationships among WAIS variability, Earth’s orbital configuration, oceanic temperature and circulation, and atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2};$ and   
• Constrain the timing of Ross Sea continental shelf overdeepening and assess its impact on Neogene and Quaternary ice dynamics.  

Expedition 374 departed from Lyttelton, New Zealand, in January 2018 and returned in March 2018. We recovered $1292.70~\mathrm{m}$ of high-quality core from five sites spanning the early Miocene to lat e Quaternary. Three sites were cored on the continental shelf (Site s U1521, U1522, and U1523). At Site U1521, we cored a $650~\mathrm{m}$ thic k sequence of interbedded diamictite and diatom-rich mudstone penetrating seismic Ross Sea Unconformity 4 (RSU4). The depositiona l reconstructions of past glacial and open-marine conditions at thi s site will provide unprecedented insight into environmental chang e on the Antarctic continental shelf during the late early and middl e Miocene. At Site U1522, we cored a discontinuous late Miocene t o Pleistocene sequence of glacial and glaciomarine strata from th e outer shelf with the primary objective of penetrating and datin g RSU3, which is interpreted to reflect the first continental shelf– wide expansion of East and West Antarctic ice streams. Site U1523, located on the outer continental shelf, targeted a sediment drift beneath the westward-flowing Antarctic Slope Current (ASC) to tes t the hypothesis that changes in ASC vigor regulate ocean heat flu x onto the continental shelf and thus ice sheet mass balance.  

We also cored two sites on the continental rise and slope. At Sit e U1524, we recovered a Plio–Pleistocene sedimentary sequenc e from the levee of the Hillary Canyon, one of the largest conduits o f Antarctic Bottom Water from the continental shelf to the abyssa l ocean. Site U1524 was designed to penetrate into middle Miocen e and older strata, but coring was initially interrupted by drifting se a ice that forced us to abandon coring in Hole U1524A at $399.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ drilling depth below seafloor (DSF). We moved to a nearby alternat e site on the continental slope (Site U1525) to core a single hole designed to complement the record at Site U1524. We returned to Sit e U1524 after the sea ice cleared and cored Hole U1524C with the rotary core barrel system with the intention of reaching the targe t depth of $1000\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF. However, we were forced to terminate Hol e U1524C at $441.9\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF because of a mechanical failure with th e vessel that resulted in termination of all drilling operations an d forced us to return to Lyttelton 16 days earlier than scheduled. Th e loss of $39\%$ of our operational days significantly impacted our abilit y to achieve all Expedition 374 objectives. In particular, we were no t able to recover continuous middle Miocene sequences from th e continental rise designed to complement the discontinuous recor d from continental shelf Site U1521. The mechanical failure als o meant we could not recover cores from proposed Site RSCR-19A, which was targeted to obtain a high-fidelity, continuous record o f upper Neogene and Quaternary pelagic/hemipelagic sedimentation. Despite our failure to recover a continental shelf-to-rise Miocene transect, records from Sites U1522, U1524, and U1525 an d legacy cores from the Antarctic Geological Drilling Project (ANDRILL) can be integrated to develop a shelf-to-rise Plio–Pleistocen e transect.  

of demonstrated climate sensitivity (Figure F4), allow for improve d understanding of ocean–ice sheet interactions on orbital to millionyear timescales.  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 37 4 recovered Ross Sea outer continental shelf-to-rise sedimentary sequences of Neogene to Quaternary Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) evolution that will improve understanding of climate forcings/feedback s on past ice sheet variability. These sequences, in combination wit h model sensitivity tests, tectonic considerations, and the well-developed seismic stratigraphic framework of the Ross Sea, will enabl e researchers to determine the contribution of Antarctic ice volum e to far-field Neogene sea level variations $(20{-}60\ \mathrm{m})$ (cf., Miller et al., 2005, 2012; Kominz et al., 2008; Naish and Wilson, 2009; John et al., 2011) (Figures F1, F2, F3). These sequences, recovered from an are a  

The onset of the Neogene ( $\mathrm{23~Ma}$ ; Oligocene/Miocene [O/M ] boundary) is associated with a transient, abrupt increase in Antarctic ice volume attributed to changes in Earth’s orbital parameter s (Zachos et al., 1997; Naish et al., 2001) and declining atmospheri c $C O_{2}$ (Figure F1) (Pagani et al., 2005; Foster and Rohling, 2013). Following the relatively cool early Miocene, proxy records indicate  a period of sustained global warmth (on average ${\sim}3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ warmer tha n present; Flower and Kennett, $1994;$ You et al., 2009) and a significant carbon cycle reorganization (e.g., Vincent and Berger, 1985; Foster et al., 2012) referred to as the Miocene Climatic Optimu m (MCO; ${\sim}17{-}14.5\ \mathrm{Ma}_{}$ ) (Flower and Kennett, 1994; Shevenell et al., 2004). During the MCO, significant polar amplification of temperature occurred (Shevenell et al., 2004, 2008; Lewis et al., 2008; Warn y et al., 2009; Feakins et al., 2012; Sangiorgi et al., 2018), the origins o f which are unknown. Immediately following the MCO, Antarctic ic e growth and cooling, termed the Middle Miocene Climate Transition (MMCT; $14.2–13.8\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ), is inferred from both deep-sea benthic foraminifer $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ records and ice-proximal data (Figure F1B ) (Kennett, 1977; Flower and Kennett, 1994; Zachos et al., 2001; Shevenell et al., 2004, 2008; Holbourn et al., 2007; Cramer et al., 2009; John et al., 2011; Pierce et al., 2017; Sangiorgi et al., 2018). However, far-field evidence suggests ice growth may have initiate d during the MCO (Shevenell et al., 2004, 2008). The MMCT resulte d in the loss of the Antarctic tundra vegetation at high elevations i n the Transantarctic Mountains (Lewis et al., 2008). Although ice expansion has traditionally been inferred in East Antarctica, Ross Se a seismic evidence also suggests West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) expansion during the MMCT (Bart, 2003). However, the timing of th e Ross Sea event, WAIS development, and forcings and feedbacks involved in the MMCT remain enigmatic, as does the subsequent climate and ice sheet history of the relatively late Miocene (e.g., Kennett, 1977; De Santis et al., 1995; Zachos et al., 2001; Ohneiser e t al., 2015; Herbert et al., 2016). During the mid-Pliocene, global se a levels are estimated to have been ${\sim}20\pm10\,\mathrm{m}$ above present-day levels, indicating a reduction/collapse of both the Greenland Ice Shee t and the WAIS (Miller et al., 2012). Ice-proximal sedimentary facie s indicate WAIS advances and retreats from the early Pliocene to ${\sim}1.0$ Ma (Figure F4) (Naish et al., 2009). However, equivocal evidence exists for WAIS collapse as recently as the last interglacial (Scherer e t al., 1998; Kopp et al., 2009; Naish et al., 2009; McKay et al., 2012b; Dahl-Jensen et al., 2013; Kingslake et al., 2018). Thus, obtaining lat e Pleistocene paleoclimate records from the Ross Sea was a high priority for Expedition 374.  

# Introduction  

# Background  

# Oceanographic setting  

At present, the abyssal ocean is filled with cold, dense seawate r produced in the large polynyas of the Weddell and Ross Seas (Ors i et al., 1999; Johnson, 2008). Thus, regional changes in temperatur e and/or meltwater input to the Ross Sea are expected to have a pronounced impact on global meridional overturning circulation (Jacobs et al., 2002; Orsi and Wiederwohl, 2009; Purkey and Johnson, 2010). Over the past 40 y, Ross Sea–derived Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) has freshened as a result of increased meltwater inpu t to the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas from melting ic e shelves/glacial systems (Jacobs et al., 2002, 2011; Johnson, 2008; Jacobs and Giulivi, 2010; Purkey and Johnson, 2010, 2012).

Unlike the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, where the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) impinges the continental shel f and cross-shelf bathymetry encourages the presence of relativel y warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) on the inner shelf (Rigno t and Jacobs, 2002), the eastern limb of the Ross Gyre brings coole r modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) to the Ross Sea alon g the lower continental slope (Whitworth et al., 1995; Orsi and Wiederwohl, 2009). The strong westward-flowing Antarctic Slope Current (ASC), which has a sharp subsurface front (Antarctic Slop e Front), separates Antarctic Surface Water (AASW) on the shel f from mCDW on the lower continental slope (Figure F5). This fron t serves as a dynamic barrier that limits the transfer of CDW an d mCDW onto the Ross Sea continental shelf (Ainley and Jacobs, 1981). Thus, ASC vigor and the formation of fresh AASW regulat e the volume of mCDW on the Ross Sea continental shelf.  

# Geological setting and previous drilling  

The breakup of Gondwana during the Middle Jurassic bega n with the initiation of the West Antarctic Rift, which led to the opening of the Ross Sea (Behrendt et al., 1991) and the development o f three sedimentary basins (Figures F2, F3) (Cooper et al., 1991). Th e westernmost Victoria Land Basin (VLB) was the focus of previou s regional geological drilling (e.g., Dry Valley Drilling Project, McMurdo Sound Sediments and Tectonics Studies (MSSTS), Cenozoi c  

Investigations in the Western Ross Sea [CIROS-1 and CIROS-2], Cape Roberts Project [CRP], and the Antarctic Geological Drillin g Project [ANDRILL]). Expedition 374 focused on the Eastern Basin, which encompasses the Glomar Challenger Basin and contains a s much as $6\,\mathrm{km}$ of Cenozoic sediment infill (Figure F3).  

The basement geology of the Ross Sea Central High adjacent t o the Eastern Basin was penetrated at Deep Sea Drilling Projec t (DSDP) Site 270 and consists of high-grade Paleozoic calcareou s metamorphic rocks (Ford and Barrett, 1975) that were mylonitize d during Late Cretaceous uplift (Siddoway et al., 2004). Upper Cretaceous mylonites were also recovered from the western part of th e Eastern Basin (Luyendyk et al., 2001). The lack of basement younge r than Devonian at CRP-3 and Site 270 suggests that younger Permian–Triassic Beacon Supergroup strata are likely absent in the Ros s Sea. This interpretation is supported by paleogeographic map s from Barrett (1981) that, although poorly constrained, suggest tha t the Ross Sea was likely an area of uplift and erosion through muc h

of the Permian–Triassic. The lower part of the Beacon Supergrou p (Devonian) is dominated by coarse clastics (Barrett, 1981). The tectonic models for the formation of the Ross Sea, through the thinning of thickened $^{'}{\sim}40\ \mathrm{km})$ crust that extends across the entir e Transantarctic Mountain (TAM)–Ross Sea–Marie Byrd Land region (Karner et al., 2005; Decesari et al., 2007), would also tend t o argue against the preservation of upper Beacon Supergroup strat a because uplift and erosion of these strata is predicted during earl y rifting. Consequently, rifting would result in a very different provenance signature for glacial deposits transported from the wester n compared with the eastern Ross Sea.

Figure F3. Ross Sea seismic stratigraphy and previous drilling (see Figure F7 for transect line). Expedition 374 sites form a continental shelf-to-rise transec t designed to tie into inner shelf sites and trace the Neogene and Quaternary evolution of the WAIS and the forcings and feedbacks influencing past variability.  

The Antarctic Offshore Stratigraphy (ANTOSTRAT) seismi c stratigraphic scheme defines eight seismic units (RSS-1 to RSS-8) i n the sediment infill above the basement. These seismic units ar e bounded by six major shelf-wide seismic unconformities (RSU1– RSU6) (Figures F3, F6; Table T1) (Brancolini et al., 1995; De Santi s et al., 1995) whose ages are only partially constrained by drilling (se e synthesis by Bart and De Santis, 2012). In the western Ross Sea, CIROS-1 and CRP-3 indicate marine-terminating glaciation in th e TAM by the earliest Oligocene (Barrett, 1989, 2007). Seismic-base d reconstructions suggest ice caps nucleated on subaerially expose d basement highs in the central Ross Sea during the Oligocene. Th e adjacent deep-water basins in the outer Ross Sea appear to have remained free of grounded ice until the late Oligocene, although the y were probably influenced by voluminous sediment-laden meltwate r plumes associated with more temperate glacial sedimentation, resulting in progressive shoaling of the Eastern Basin as accommodation space filled (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1975a; De Santis et al., 1995). A major goal of Expedition 374 is to constrain the ages o f RSU4 through RSU1 to understand how these features relate to th e marine-based WAIS evolution.  

Strata (Unit RSS-1) underlying RSU6 are the oldest and deepes t basin-infill sedimentary packages in the central Ross Sea. Unit RSS1 is divided into lower and upper packages. The lower part of Uni t RSS-1 has not been drilled, whereas the upper part was drilled i n the western Ross Sea (CRP and CIROS-1) and consists of upper Eocene to Oligocene high-energy fluvial, deltaic, and shallow-shel f rift-fill strata, the uppermost of which were glacially influence d (Fielding et al., 2000; Galeotti et al., 2016). The lithology and age o f the lowermost strata below RSU6 are uncertain because this interval has not been sampled, but it likely consists of coarse-grained fluvial facies deposited in the initial phases of Late Cretaceous t o

These ice-proximal sites wil l enable the assessment of the Antarctic contributions to sea level lowstands, building significantly on the ANDRILL record.

RSBW (blue arrow ) derived from the ice shelf water (not shown) flows downslope in the Hillar y Canyon and along the central and western Ross Sea shelf slope, contributin g to deep waters (e.g., Antarctic Deep Water vs. Antarctic Bottom Water). Th e ASC carries surface waters westward along the continental shelf break. Thi s along-slope flow also acts to regulate mCDW transport onto the continenta l shelf.  

Paleocene rifting in the central Ross Sea (Wilson and Luyendyk, 2009).  

The units overlying RSU6 have all been partially sampled b y drilling, making the stratigraphic architecture in the Ross Sea relatively well constrained for this time period. However, most drill holes are located in isolated basins in the VLB of the western Ros s Sea (Figures F2, F6), and thus basin-to-basin correlation remain s uncertain. Direct correlation of RSU6 from across the various Ros s Sea basins is not possible because the unconformity onlaps basement flanks (Figure F3). However, an inferred correlation can b e made based on the distinctive acoustic character of the unconformity, which is a high-amplitude continuous reflector that is ver y distinct from the underlying seismic facies.

Two ANDRILL sites drilled on the inner continental shelf of th e western Ross Sea $98\%$ recovery) contain unprecedented records o f marine-based ice sheet variability (Naish et al., 2009; Fielding et al., 2011; Wilson et al., 2012; Patterson and Ishman, 2012; Levy et al., 2016) over the past $20\,\mathrm{My},$ , although both sites are influenced by th e East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). Drilling at Antarctic Geologica l Drilling Project (AND) Site AND-2A recovered a ${\sim}20{-}14$ Ma sequence interpreted to reflect TAM outlet glaciers overriding and/o r calving near the site (Fielding et al., 2011; Passchier et al., 2011; Lev y et al., 2016). A diatomite (dated to $15.7\;\mathrm{Ma})$ with abundant dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts), foraminifers, pollen, and other biomarker s suggests a warmer-than-present ( $\mathrm{\sim}11^{\circ}C$ mean surface temperature ) and hydrologically active climate during the MCO (Warny et al., 2009; Feakins et al., 2012).  

At 300 mbsf in Core AND-2A, a $300~\mathrm{ky}$ disconformity equivalent to RSU4 (middle Miocene) suggests a shelf-wide advance o f grounded marine-based ice originating from the EAIS during th e MMCT (Figures F6, F7, F8) (De Santis et al., 1999; Passchier et al., 2011; Levy et al., 2016). This unconformity is the first unequivoca l seismic evidence for a glacially carved trough in the central Ross Se a and is a key target of Site U1521 (Figures F7, F8) (De Santis et al., 1995; Ten Brink et al., 1995; Anderson, 1999; Anderson et al., 2018; Colleoni et al., 2018a). At DSDP Site 272, a ${\sim}400\;\mathrm{m}$ thick early–middle Miocene sequence of glaciomarine mudstone was recovere d (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1975b) (Figure F6). Approximately 25 0 m of till foreset and aggrading bottomset strata above RSU4 (D e Santis et al., 1997) is associated with numerous outwash channels, suggesting the region was influenced by large volumes of erosiv e sediment-laden meltwater during the middle Miocene ${\sim}14\,\mathrm{\:Ma}$ ; Figure F8) (Anderson and Bartek, 1992; Chow and Bart, 2003) tha t may have been associated with extensive channel-levee system s above RSU4 on the continental slope and rise (De Santis et al., 1995, 1999).  

Post-MCO cooling and glaciation caused multiple erosional episodes across the shallow central Ross Sea, which resulted in poo r preservation of the Site 272–recovered foreset strata that thicke n toward the Central High within a thick, gently seaward-dipping section, suggesting that middle Miocene glaciation records may be preserved in the eastern Ross Sea (De Santis et al., 1997; cf. Figures F7, F8). Evidence for glacial erosion and deposition in the southeasternmost Ross Sea in the Oligocene suggests the presence of an ice ca p on Marie Byrd Land (Sorlien et al., 2007). However, in the mid- t o late Miocene, the eastern Ross Sea was still a wide, gently slopin g seaward embayment surrounded by grounded ice that was delivering sediments to the slope from the Central High and Marie Byr d Land.  

RSU3, a key target of Site U1522, provides the first evidence fo r a major cross-shelf paleotrough eroded by an expanded WAIS, although the age of this event(s) is poorly constrained $({\sim}14{-}4\mathrm{\Ma};$ Figures F6, F7) (De Santis et al., 1995, 1999; Bart, 2003). Large meltwater and outwash features are absent, and laminated seismic facie s are progressively thinner/less common in strata younger tha n RSU3, suggesting sediment starvation and a transition to a colde r glacial regime. The inner–continental shelf Site AND-1B sediment s indicate that this transition may not have occurred until the Pliocene (McKay et al., 2009), although evidence for meltwater outburs t features is lacking in the TAM after $12.4\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Lewis et al., 2006).  

High-velocity seismic units above RSU3 and RSU2 suggest overcompaction by ice-loading during WAIS expansion (Böhm et al., 2009). Bathymetric reconstructions suggest that overdeepening, with a transition to a landward-deepening continental shelf, occurred by the RSU2 event during the early Pliocene to early Pleistocene(?) (Figure F7) (De Santis et al., 1995, 1999). A trough-mout h fan on the upper slope and a sediment-starved continental rise (typical of the Plio–Pleistocene Antarctic margin) coincided wit h overdeepening (Bart et al., 1999; Cooper and O’Brien, 2004; Rebesco et al., 2006; Bart and Iwai, 2012).  

At Site AND-1B, ${\sim}58$ sedimentary cycles of ice sheet advanc e and retreat are observed in the Ross Embayment over the past 1 3 My (McKay et al., 2009). Diatomites indicate frequent collapses o f the WAIS in the Pliocene $(5.3{-}2.6\,\mathrm{Ma})$ , during which diatom assemblages and geochemical paleothermometry indicate ocean temperatures were as much as $4^{\circ}C$ warmer than present (Naish et al., 2009; McKay et al., 2012a). However, sedimentary lithofacies are dominated by pelagic diatom ooze, indicating that meltwater discharg e was reduced during Pliocene interglacials compared with thic k glaciomarine mudstone deposited during the late Miocene (11–5. 3 Ma). By the mid-Pleistocene $\left(1.0\ \mathrm{Ma}\right)$ , the Ross Ice Shelf persiste d through most interglacials (McKay et al., 2009).  

Seismic facies above RSU2 are indicative of till sheets bound b y erosional unconformities in an aggrading shelf margin caused b y shelf-wide advances of the WAIS (Figure F7) (Alonso et al., 1992; Brancolini et al., 1995; Bart et al., 2011). Unlike other sectors of th e Antarctic, the eastern Ross Sea trough mouth contains thick $\leftmoon2000$ m) sedimentary sequences on the shelf and upper continental slop e that may contain a detailed WAIS history. Above RSU1 $\left(0.7?\mathrm{~Ma}\right)$ , shelf-edge sediments are aggrading or backstepping (rather tha n prograding; Bart et al., 2018), indicating that most sediment deliv

Maps of RSU4, RSU3, and RSU2 have now been extended into the continental slope and rise area (E. Olivo, unpubl. data; not shown) and into the western Ross Sea as part of the IPY Rossmap project. Gray shading in A shows the areas lying above sea level at the time of RSU6 o n the basis of DSDP Site 270 stratigraphy. Site U1521 is located at the ocean margin of one of these areas, which subsided in the early Miocene and was cut by  a large glacial valley by the early to mid-Miocene. Site U1521 will provide environmental information about paleo-ice stream and ocean current interplay durin g the middle Miocene. Site U1522 is located at the edge of a large embayment of the continental shelf in the eastern Ross Sea, where WAIS streams have carve d glacial valleys since RSU3. Sites U1521–U1525 will provide subglacial ice-proximal (Site U1522), glaciomarine ice-proximal (Site U1523) to ice-distal (Site s U1525 and U1524) Miocene to Pleistocene records of past ice sheet/ocean interactions.

# Site survey data  

Multichannel seismic (MCS) and single-channel seismic (SCS ) profiles have been collected in the Ross Sea by several nations sinc e 1980. MCS data are available through the Antarctic Seismic Dat a Library System, which works under the auspices of the Scientifi c Committee on Antarctic Research and the Antarctic Treaty (ATC M XVI-12). Prestack data are available only from the Italian cruise s (1988, 1989, 1991, 1994, and 2006) and recently also from th e BGR80 cruise.  

We selected sites based on maximum thickness of target sequence, potential for dating sediments, and acoustic facies and geometry of deposits, which usually can be seen more clearly on highresolution profiles. In most cases, high-resolution profiles are singl e channel, or in the case of the TAN060_08 profile, they have a ver y short streamer $\left(200\,\mathrm{~m}\right)$ relative to the water depth $(>\!1000{\mathrm{~m}})$ . I n some cases, crossing lines are not available; the remoteness of Antarctic water and the presence of sea ice prevents the easy collectio n of new site survey data. New MCS Profiles KSL14-02 and KSL14-0 4 (Kim et al., 2018) were collected in February 2013 and in 2015 by th e Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) with the aim of providin g cross-lines for several proposed sites. Another SCS survey cruis e

was conducted in 2017 (EU/FP7 EUROFLEETS2 ANTSSS projec t and Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide WHISPER S and ODYSSEA projects) with the aim to collect additional crosslines for proposed sites and to identify alternate sites.  

SCS data, collected by National Science Foundation (NSF ) Cruises in 1990 and 1994–1995 were made available by John Anderson (Rice University, TX) as digital SEGY data (Cruise PD90) an d paper copies (Cruise NBP 94-95). We made the conversion of th e TIFF or JPG image to SEGY format to depth-convert the section s and load the data in the IHS Kingdom interpretation software wit h the other available data sets. The supporting site survey data for Expedition 374 are archived in the IODP Site Survey Data Ban k (https://ssdb.iodp.org/SSDBquery/SSDBquery.php; select proposal number P751).  

# Scientific objectives  

1. Evaluate the contribution of West Antarctica to far-field ice volume and sea level estimates.  

Far-field benthic foraminifer $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and sequence stratigraphi c records suggest that large global ice volume and sea level $(20{-}60\;\mathrm{m})$ variations occurred during the Miocene and Pliocene (Figures F1, F6) (Zachos et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2005, 2012; Cramer et al., 2009; Raymo et al., 2011). Miocene–Pliocene sea level reconstruction s could potentially be reconciled without invoking large Norther n Hemisphere contributions if Antarctica’s ice sheets expanded to th e continental shelf edge ( ${\sim}14\mathrm{~m~}$ sea level equivalent [SLE]) (Figur e F4). The modeled difference between the glacial maxima states an d loss of the marine-based WAIS (assuming present bathymetry) represents ${\sim}21\mathrm{~m~}$ SLE (with some minor loss of the EAIS), althoug h changes in Ross Sea bathymetry could increase this value (Colleon i et al., 2018a) (Figure F4) (see Objective 5). Expedition 374 record s will help constrain the timing of the first WAIS advances to the shel f edge, and integration with ANDRILL records will allow assessmen t of the WAIS contribution to Neogene sea level estimates.  

Sedimentological and micropaleontological analyses at continental shelf Sites U1521 and U1522, combined with seismic stratigraphic correlations, will identify deposition under grounded-ice, glaciomarine,  and  open-marine  conditions  following  AN  

DRILL/CRP methodology (Fielding et al., 2000, 2011; Powell an d Cooper, 2002; McKay et al., 2009; Passchier et al., 2011). Magneto-, bio-, and tephrochronology will enable identification of orbitalscale ice sheet variations and have been employed in discontinuou s Antarctic margin sequences (Florindo et al., 2003, 2005; Tauxe et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2012) (Figure F4). Furthermore, new quantitative techniques have greatly enhanced the biostratigraphic framework of the Southern Ocean (Cody et al., 2008, 2012; Crampton e t al., 2016). Glacially reworked volcanic clasts (Wilson et al., 2012 ) and radiometrically datable felsic ashes from Marie Byrd Land ma y be used to provide maximum ages (Wilch et al., 1999). Climat e snapshots near magnetic reversals will be targeted (e.g., the M2 glacial in Figure F4) because these events can be traced to more continuous records from the continental rise (Site U1524) and global sea level records. Sediment provenance studies (clast/sand petrology, mineral thermochronology, and radiogenic isotope analysis) a t Sites U1521 and U1522 will enable understanding of the changes i n the origin of sediments (e.g., local ice caps versus ice sheet expansion and provenance from East versus West Antarctic sources) (Figure F7) (Licht et al., 2005, 2014; Talarico et al., 2012; Cook et al., 2013; Perotti et al., 2017; Simões Pereira et al., 2018). As with all objectives, data integration with modeling studies will be undertake n (Figure F4) (Golledge et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2013; DeConto an d Pollard, 2016; Gasson et al., 2016; Colleoni et al., 2018b).  

2. Reconstruct ice-proximal atmospheric and oceanic temperatures to identify past polar amplification and assess its forcings/feedbacks.  

Obtaining atmospheric and ocean temperatures from the Expedition 374 drill sites will enable the paleoclimate community to address the following key scientific questions:  

• Were polar temperatures sensitive to the low-amplitude variations in Neogene atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}{}^{\cdot}$ ?   
• Were Neogene ocean and atmospheric temperatures at the Antarctic margin amplified relative to the global mean, and if so, what were the forcings?   
• How did ocean temperatures evolve as Antarctica’s ice sheets expanded and contracted during major Neogene climate transitions and on orbital timescales?  

Although the ANDRILL records provide important archives o f high-latitude oceanic conditions, they only provide snapshots o f temperature and sea ice conditions through interglacials, whe n these sites were not covered by ice (Warny et al., 2009; McKay et al., 2012a; Levy et al., 2016). In contrast, Sites U1521 and U1522 provide intervals of more continuous sedimentation (albeit with som e periods of erosion during large glaciations) because they are i n paleobathymetric depressions that provided the accommodatio n space needed for preservation after ice expansion (De Santis et al., 1995). These sites are also farther out on the continental shelf, nea r the paleoshelf break (Figure F7), and are therefore less likely to b e frequently overridden by grounded ice (Pollard and DeConto, 2009; Bart et al., 2011). More continuous records of oceanographi c change were recovered at Sites U1523–U1525, providing high-latitude information on late Neogene and Quaternary ocean and atmospheric  temperatures,  meltwater  input,  and  bottom  wate r production.  

Lithofacies analysis will be used to reconstruct glacial therma l regimes and glacial cyclicity (cf. McKay et al., 2009; Naish et al., 2009), whereas diatom and radiolarian census counts, marine an d terrestrial palynology, organic biomarkers (e.g., $\mathrm{TEX}_{86},$ branche d and isoprenoid tetraether [BIT] index, and methylation of branche d tetraether [MBT]/cyclization of branched tetraether [CBT] proxy; cf. McKay et al., 2012a; Levy et al., 2016; Sangiorgi et al., 2018), an d redox-sensitive metals (e.g., Mn, U, Re, and Mo) provide records fo r paleoproductivity, high-latitude marine and terrestrial climate, an d oceanography. Lithofacies analysis is also relevant to monitoring alteration of the biomarkers by methanogenesis and shifting redo x boundaries. Biogenic carbonate (e.g., calcareous nannofossils/foraminifers) is also present in Expedition 374 Neogene and uppe r Pleistocene interglacial sequences and at other circum-Antarcti c sites (e.g., Theissen et al., 2003; Scherer et al., 2008; Villa et al., 2008; Expedition 318 Scientists, 2011). In the lower to middle Miocene, biogenic carbonate is more common in the Southern Ocean an d Antarctic margins (Hayes et al., 1975; Kennett and Barker, 1990; Shipboard Scientific Party, 2001; Shevenell et al., 2004; Expeditio n 318 Scientists, 2011; Fielding et al., 2011), making stable isotop e $\mathrm{\Delta\left[\delta^{18}O\right.}$ and $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}_{\prime}$ , trace element (e.g., Mg/Ca, Li/Ca, U/Ca, Ba/Ca, and B/Ca), and clumped isotope analyses possible. However, for al l of the proxies discussed above, their strengths/weaknesses in a marginal marine setting should be considered.  

3. Assess the role of oceanic forcing (e.g., sea level and temperature) on WAIS stability/instability.  

WAIS retreat events during past warmer-than-present climate s may have been the consequence of intensified ocean–cryosphere interactions (Naish et al., 2009; Pollard and DeConto, 2009). Interactions between the wind-driven upwelling of warm CDW and the ic e shelves that buttress the WAIS appear to play a significant role i n modern ice mass loss in West Antarctica (e.g., Mercer, 1978; Joughin et al., 2012; Pritchard et al., 2012; Shepherd et al., 2012). Observations and numerical ice sheet models suggest that change s in ocean heat flux are a key factor influencing the stability/instability of the WAIS (Golledge et al., 2012; Pritchard et al., 2012; DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Rintoul et al., 2018). We postulate tha t changes in either the formation of AASW and AABW or the vigo r of the wind-driven ASC control incursions of CDW onto the Ros s Sea continental slope and shelf and the resultant retreat of the WAI S (Figure F5). The records from Expedition 374 will allow us to tes t this hypothesis by simultaneously assessing AASW/AABW/AS C changes from grain size and lithofacies analysis of sediment mound s on the continental shelf bank, slope, and rise (e.g., Sites U1523– U1525) and ice sheet extent in the Ross Embayment (Sites U152 1 and U1522, DSDP Site 272, and ANDRILL sites).  

The Ross Sea is also one of the three main sources of AAB W that feed the abyssal ocean (to become Southern Component Wate r [SCW]). In the middle Miocene, benthic foraminifer $\delta^{13}C$ indicate s changes in the relative input of SCW and Northern Componen t Water (NCW) into the global ocean (Woodruff and Savin, 1985; Wright et al., 1991; Shevenell et al., 2004; Cramer et al., 2009). Newer proxies, such as Nd isotopes, are now used to further refin e the geographic source of deep-water production (e.g., van de Flierd t et al., 2004; Scher and Martin, 2006; Newkirk and Martin, 2009; Huck et al., 2017). Thus, the records obtained during Expeditio n 374 and comparison with far-field records will provide insight int o temporal changes in SCW production through the Neogene (Vincent and Berger, 1985; Flower and Kennett, 1994; Hodell and VenzCurtis, 2006).  

Paleocurrent strength associated with past ASC changes and th e history of AABW transport through the Hillary Canyon will be reconstructed by examining the sedimentological (e.g., lithofacie s analysis and grain size) and magnetic characteristics of Site s U1523–U1525 (e.g., Bianchi et al., 1999; Hall et al., 2001; Prins et al., 2002; Joseph et al., 2004). Micropaleontological, geochemical, an d sedimentological records from drill cores from all Expedition 37 4 sites will provide reconstructions of changing regional surface an d seafloor conditions (e.g., sea ice, surface stratification, sea-surfac e temperatures [SSTs], polynya mixing, glacial meltwater discharge, nutrient uptake, and supercooling of dense water by ice shelves ) proximal to the AISs (e.g., Shevenell et al., 2011; McKay et al., 2012a; Houben et al., 2013; Levy et al., 2016; Sangiorgi et al., 2018) and thu s AABW (and SCW) formation. Additionally, downslope currents resulting from the transfer of High-Salinity Shelf Water into the abyssal ocean can also be assessed (and distinguished from ASC flow) b y integrated lithofacies analysis, geochemistry, micropaleontology, and seismic-reflection profiles (e.g., Hepp et al., 2006; Lucchi an d Rebesco, 2007; Caburlotto et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2018) at Site s U1523–U1525. Carbonate-based paleotemperature and carbonat e ion proxies (e.g., foraminiferal Mg/Ca, Li/Ca, U/Ca, and clumpe d isotopes) will also be applied where appropriate species are preserved (see Objective 2).  

4. Identify the sensitivity of WAIS to Earth’s orbital configuration under a variety of climate boundary conditions.  

Fundamental questions remain about the orbital pacing of AI S development and variability. The Ross Sea Expedition 374 sequences will shed light on the absence of the $20\,\mathrm{ky}$ precession cycl e in benthic $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ records (Figure F4) (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005; Huybers, 2006; Raymo et al., 2006) and the origin of transient shifts i n the sensitivity of Earth’s climate system to orbital forcing (e.g., $40-$ 100 ky–dominated frequencies) in the middle Miocene (Shevenell et al., 2004) and Plio–Pleistocene (Tzedakis et al., 2017).  

A recent hypothesis suggests that the last such shift in Earth history (the mid-Pleistocene transition) was initiated by an abrupt increase in Antarctic ice volume (Elderfield et al., 2012). Thi s hypothesis may be tested by identifying and dating groundin g events on the outer Ross Sea continental shelf. If the dominant frequency of AIS advance and retreat shifted from 40 to $100\;\mathrm{ky}$ at 0. 8 Ma, records from this sensitive region will likely record this transition.  

Recent evidence from ice-proximal drill sites indicates that AIS s did advance and retreat with 40 and 100 ky cyclicity in the Neogen e (Grützner et al., 2003; Williams and Handwerger, 2005; Naish et al., 2009; Patterson et al., 2014). We envision a more complete pictur e of the forcings and feedbacks involved with ice advance and retrea t from our outer shelf to slope/rise transect. Sedimentological analyses (complemented by downhole logs) will enable development o f an orbital-scale continental shelf-to-rise sequence stratigraphy o f glacial advance and retreat (all Expedition 374 sites; see Objectiv e 1). Additional micropaleontologic data, inorganic and organic geochemistry (e.g., $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O},$ , $\delta^{13}{\cal C}$ , $\mathrm{Mg/Ca}$ , and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Nd}})$ , minor and trace elements (X-ray fluorescence and discrete samples), and organi c biomarkers may be used to assess associated frequencies of chang e in the outermost continental shelf, slope, and rise sites (U1523– U1525).  

5. Reconstruct eastern Ross Sea bathymetry to examine relationships between seafloor geometry, ice sheet stability/instability, and global climate.  

The transition from a terrestrial (or shallow marine) West Antarctica with a seaward-dipping shallow continental shelf to that o f the modern overdeepened (i.e., landward dipping) continental shel f would have had a first-order control on AIS volume and mass balance (Wilson et al., 2013; Gasson et al., 2016). The cooling threshol d for the development of a terrestrial-based ice sheet is lower tha n that of a marine-based ice sheet, which is highly sensitive to change s in oceanic heat flux (Figure F4) (Pollard and DeConto, 2009 ; Golledge et al., 2012; Colleoni et al., 2018a). A terrestrial (or shallo w marine) West Antarctica may have supported a larger ice sheet i n warmer-than-present climates, whereas overdeepening of the continental shelves may have resulted in a smaller ice sheet with les s frequent ice sheet advances, as hypothesized for the Antarctic Peninsula (e.g., Bart and Iwai, 2012). Ice sheet models indicate that  a largely terrestrial West Antarctica could accommodate an extra ${\sim}13$ million ${\mathbf{k}}{\mathbf{m}}^{3}$ of grounded ice in the warmer-than-present climate o f the Eocene ( $\sim\!30\:\mathrm{m}$ SLE; Figure F4) (Wilson et al., 2013). Therefore, constraining the timing of overdeepening in the Ross Sea is critica l to reconcile far-field records of eustatic sea level variance into th e late Neogene and Quaternary (see Objective 1).  

The timing of Ross Sea shelf overdeepening is currently unconstrained. However, the Ross Sea has the most developed seismi c framework in Antarctica and the highest resolution history of WAI S variability currently available (ANDRILL), making this locatio n ideal for achieving this objective. Dating the sedimentary sequenc e and providing information about the depositional environment a t the time of formation of RSU3 and RSU2 (Figure F6) at Sites U152 1 and U1522 in the eastern Ross Sea (by methodologies in Objectiv e 1) will constrain the timing of this overdeepening (Figure F7).  

# Site summaries Site U1521  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1521 (proposed Site EBOCS-01D) is located in the Pennel l Basin at $75^{\circ}41.0351^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}40.3108^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at $562\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figur e F9). The site is on the continental shelf near a northeast–southwestoriented Miocene paleotrough identified by mapping regional unconformities in seismic-reflection profiles. The primary objective a t Site U1521 was to sample and date strata above and below RSU4, which was previously identified in seismic stratigraphic studie s (Hinz and Block, 1984; Anderson and Bartek, 1992; Cooper et al., 1997) (Figure F10). RSU4 is a regional angular unconformity (Figure F8) that has been mapped over most of the Ross Sea and is in

![](images/a2e4bc6b7a58dadd5e31443a28c99430e6d65fec73e3b1281ed1577bc33c4934.jpg)  
terpreted to represent a cross-shelf expansion of the EAIS in th e central regions of the Ross Sea (Brancolini et al., 1995; De Santis e t al., 1995). Coring through RSU4 should improve the broad age constraints provided for the unconformity by DSDP Sites 272 and 27 3 (Bart, 2003).  

Records from this site will directly address all five primary Expedition 374 objectives. The record of ice advance and retreat fro m Site U1521, when integrated with seismic stratigraphy, provenanc e studies, and numerical modeling, will allow for a more complete assessment of Antarctica’s contributions to numerous variations i n far-field Miocene sea level (Objective 1) (Miller et al., 2005; John e t al., 2011). The magnitude of polar amplification during the MC O will be assessed through proxies for oceanic and atmospheric temperatures derived from both in situ marine organic matter an d meltwater-transported  terrestrial  organic  matter  (e.g.,  micropaleontology and lipid biomarkers) (Objective 2). Insights into th e oceanic drivers of early Miocene retreat of marine-terminating ic e sheets and their subsequent middle to late Miocene readvances ca n be achieved by detailed lithofacies analysis. This information can b e paired with micropaleontological and geochemical proxies to identify the magnitude of the oceanic change and to understand the effect of ocean heat on ice sheet variability (Objective 3). Similarly, these methods, when combined with downhole logging results t o complete the stratigraphy, will identify the sensitivity of middl e Miocene ice sheets to orbital forcing based on the presence of cyclicity in the open-marine, glaciomarine, and glacial proximal sediments (Objective 4). Finally, a “backstripped” paleobathymetr y established with accurate dating and depth estimates of the RSU 4 surface and other unconformities at Site U1521, in combinatio n with previous drilling constraints from other locations in the Ros s Sea, will allow for a fuller assessment of bathymetric controls o n AIS evolution.  

# Operations  

After a $2014\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Lyttelton, the vessel arrived at Sit e U1521 at $0954\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{[UTC+13\,h]}$ ) on 16 January 2018. The original operations plan for Site U1521 called for a single rotary core barre l (RCB) hole to $950\;\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth below seafloor (DSF) and downhole logging with the triple combination (triple combo), Formatio n MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic, and Vertical Seismic Imager (VSI) too l strings. We ultimately cored Hole U1521A to $650.1\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF (Core s 374-U1521A-1R through 71R) (Table T2). Coring proceeded without incident through Core 37R $?0{-}352.5\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF); however, afte r poor recovery in Cores 32R through 37R $(14.49\;\mathrm{m};25\%)$ ) caused b y jamming of the core barrel with clasts, we switched to cutting halflength cores to improve core recovery. Cores 38R through 43 R $(352.5{-}381.3\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{DSF})$ ) were collected using a $4.8\;\mathrm{m}$ advance (instea d of $9.6\ \mathrm{~m~},$ ),  which  significantly  improved  recovery $(80\%)$ .  W e switched back to $9.6\:\mathrm{m}$ advances after the formation became less indurated and continued to core with the RCB system from Core 44 R through Core 71R $(381.3{-}650.1\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF). We terminated coring a t that depth after meeting the primary scientific objectives. At th e end of coring operations, we displaced the hole with heavy (10. 5 $1\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{gal})$ mud and logged with all three tool strings, all of whic h reached to within $\mathord{\sim}1\;\mathrm{m}$ of the bottom of the hole. Operations at Sit e U1521 concluded at $2245~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 January. A total of $132.75\,\mathrm{h}$ (5. 5 days) were spent at Site U1521. RCB coring in Hole U1521A penetrated to $650.1\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, recovering $411.50\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(63\%)$ .

# Principal results  

The $648\;\mathrm{m}$ succession of lower Miocene to recent sediment recovered at Site U1521 is divided into seven lithostratigraphic unit s (I–VII). Unit VI is further divided into Subunits VIA–VIC (Figur e F11). Contacts between lithostratigraphic units at Site U1521 rang e from sharp to gradational. Mudstone and diamictite account fo r ${\sim}90\%$ of the recovered core, and minor lithofacies include chert an d conglomerate (Figure F11). The assemblage of facies reflects openmarine to ice-proximal depositional environments at this locatio n since at least the early Miocene $(\sim\!18\,\,\mathrm{Ma})$ .  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I ( $\mathrm{0-7.4~m}$ core depth below seafloor , Method A [CSF-A]) consists of a sequence of unconsolidated oliv e to dark grayish brown diatom-rich mud with dispersed clasts an d gray diatom-bearing sandy mud. Unit II is ${\sim}80\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and consist s of dark gray massive clast-poor muddy diamictite interbedded wit h bioturbated diatom-bearing/rich mudstone with dispersed clasts. There are several intervals of physically intermixed diatom-bearing/rich mudstone and diamictite with microfaulting and soft-sediment deformation features. Unit III ${\sim}124\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick) consists o f bioturbated olive gray to greenish gray diatom-bearing/rich mudstone. Some intervals are faintly laminated, and whole bivalve shell s and shell fragments are present throughout. Unit IV consists of $\mathord{\sim}70$ m of dark gray massive diatom-bearing clast-poor sandy diamictit e with basalt clasts. Mudstone and diamictite are interbedded at th e top and bottom of the unit, and a conglomerate composed of elongated mudstone intraclasts is observed at the base of the unit. Uni t $\mathrm{V}$ is a $40\;\mathrm{{m}}$ interval of poorly recovered chert nodules and silica cemented mudstone. Unit VI ( ${\sim}245\;\mathrm{m}$ thick) is characterized by interbedded mudstone and diamictite that is divided into three subunit s based on the style of interbedding. Subunit VIA ( $\sim\!56\;\mathrm{m}$ thick) consists of interbedded dark gray massive diamictite with silica-cementing and mudstone, whereas Subunit VIB ${\sim}60~\mathrm{~m~}$ thick ) consists of massive to stratified dark gray sandy diamictite with shel l fragments, calcium carbonate nodules, and three intervals of clastsupported conglomerate. Subunit VIC ( ${\sim}128\mathrm{~m~}$ thick) is a sequenc e of interbedded mudstone with dispersed clasts and sandy diamictit e with carbonate concretions and shell fragments. Unit VII consists o f ${\sim}70\;\mathrm{m}$ of interbedded massive to stratified sandy diamictite.

Micropaleontological investigation included examination o f core catcher samples and additional samples from split core sections for diatoms, radiolarians, foraminifers, calcareous nannofossils, and palynomorphs (including dinocysts, pollen, and spores ) to obtain biostratigraphic ages and preliminary paleoenvironmenta l information. The presence and abundances of the microfossi l groups vary significantly throughout the recovered sediment column (Figure F11). Rich assemblages of diatoms are present in th e upper ${\sim}280\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Below that depth, diatoms are altered t o opal-CT or are poorly preserved and offer minimal biostratigraphi c constraint. Radiolarians are rare in the upper ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, an d their abundance decreases significantly downhole. Foraminifers an d palynomorphs are generally sparse throughout the hole, and calcareous nannofossils are only present in trace numbers deeper tha n ${\sim}525\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. All microfossil group assemblages represent a combination of in situ and reworked taxa of different ages.  

Although all investigated microfossil groups provide valuabl e age and/or paleoenvironmental information, diatoms provide th e best age constraints, particularly in the upper ${\sim}280~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Figure F11). Shallower than $75\textrm{m}$ CSF-A, age assignment is difficul t because of reworking; however, diatom and radiolarian assemblage s suggest a late Pliocene to Pleistocene/recent age for the uppermos t $25~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. An unconformity at ${\sim}25\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A separates Pliocen e sediment from middle Miocene sediment. Age-diagnostic diatom s present between ${\sim}75$ and $280\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ allow assignment of that interval to the Actinocyclus ingens and Denticulopsis maccollumii Zones (middle to early Miocene). Dinocysts and other aquatic palynomorphs confirm this age. Between $\mathord{\sim}280$ and $380\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, siliceous microfossils are altered to opal-CT. From $\mathord{\sim}380$ to $580\;\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{CSF}}.$ - A, diatoms are present but preservation is poor, with valves occurring as silicified casts. Despite this lithology, the presence of Thalassiosira sp. cf. Thalassiosira bukryi and absence of Thalassiosir a praefraga indicate an early Miocene age. Dinocysts are present ove r this interval, but the assemblage contains a mix of in situ and reworked taxa. Siliceous microfossils are absent deeper than $580\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A, whereas dinocysts and calcareous nannofossils are presen t and could indicate an early Miocene age if not reworked.  

Foraminifers are generally sparse, and the assemblages are dominated by calcareous benthic species. The foraminifer assemblage s represent distinct biofacies that vary in parallel with the lithofacie s recovered at Site U1521. Well-preserved diatoms and dinocysts indicate a highly productive and seasonally stratified water colum n between $\mathord{\sim}75$ and $280\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ (early to early middle Miocene). Al l microfossils will greatly contribute to constraining paleoceanographic and paleoproductivity changes that occurred through th e early to middle Miocene in the Ross Sea.

Figure F11. Site U1521 summary. Preliminary environmental interpretation is based on microfossils.  

Paleomagnetic investigations focused on measurements of archive-half core sections and oriented discrete (cube) samples. Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) measurements of archive-hal f core sections were conducted before and after progressive alternating field (AF) demagnetization, commonly in $5~\mathrm{mT}$ increments u p to $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ peak AF. After $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ peak AF demagnetization, NRM intensity usually ranges between $\mathord{\sim}10^{-4}$ and $10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ and varies wit h lithology. Selected discrete samples were also used for initial NR M measurement, followed by NRM measurements after progressiv e AF demagnetization in $2{-}10~\mathrm{mT}$ increments up to a peak AF of 8 0 mT. Principal component analysis (PCA) of these measurements reveals a stable characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) component in most of the samples, yielding normal and reverse d polarities based on inclination data. Steep upward or downward inclinations are also present in most intervals of archive-half core dat a and agree with directions from discrete samples, suggesting a stabl e and reliable magnetic carrier that can be used for magnetostratigraphic interpretation. The identified normal and reversed polarit y zones can be correlated to the geomagnetic polarity timescal e (GPTS) with the aid of biostratigraphic datums.  

Discrete samples were also used to measure the anisotropy o f magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and mean bulk magnetic susceptibility. The AMS agrees well with variability in the lithostratigraphi c units. For instance, AMS shows an oblate fabric that reflects sedimentary compaction in the diatom-bearing/rich mudstone of lithostratigraphic Unit III.  

Physical property measurements were conducted on wholeround cores, split core sections, and discrete samples. In general, the whole-round core gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk densit y and magnetic susceptibility measurements show trends similar t o those from discrete moisture and density (MAD) samples and poin t measurements of magnetic susceptibility on the section halves (Figure F11). A downhole increase in $P$ -wave caliper (PWC) values generally coincides with an increase in bulk density and a decrease i n porosity. Downhole variations in natural gamma radiation (NGR ) also correlate well to changes in bulk density. Downhole changes i n physical property characteristics are in good overall agreement wit h the lithostratigraphic units, which are defined based on sedimentological characteristics. In general, diatom-bearing/rich mud(stone ) lithofacies (lithostratigraphic Units I–III and V) correspond wit h low  magnetic  susceptibility,  NGR,  thermal  conductivity $_{<1}$ $\scriptstyle\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}])$ , and bulk density and high porosity. The lowest grai n density and highest porosity correspond with diatom-bearing/ric h mudstone, which is the dominant facies in lithostratigraphic Uni t III (Figure F11). In contrast, intervals that are predominantly diamictite (Units II, IV, VI, and VII) are characterized by increase d NGR; high bulk density, $P.$ -wave velocity, and thermal conductivity; moderate to high magnetic susceptibility; and low to moderate porosity. Variations in magnetic susceptibility for clast-poor diamictit e (low to moderate) and clast-rich diamictite (variable and generall y high) suggest that magnetic susceptibility is an indicator of th e abundance of glacially transported clasts or coarse sand in the sediment (Figure F11).  

Headspace gas analyses show low methane and ethane concentrations in the upper $40\mathrm{\;m\,CSF-A}$ at Site U1521, and concentration s increase downhole to 67,000 ppmv methane and 264 ppmv ethane. Interstitial water analyses on 15 samples from the uppermost $\mathord{\sim}360$ m CSF-A show a typical diagenetic profile with sulfate reductio n and increasing ammonium concentration in the uppermost $76\textrm{m}$ CSF-A. Alkalinity follows a profile similar to that of ammonium, and barium concentration increases deeper than ${\sim}76\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and carbonate (Ca$\mathrm{CO}_{3},$ ) contents are generally low $(<\!1.2,0.1$ , and $<\!6\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , respectively ) (Figure F11). TOC content is slightly higher in the mudstone facie s in the upper $300\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and decreases in the diamictite betwee n ${\sim}330$ and $640\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The TOC/TN ratio suggests mixed input o f terrestrial- and marine-derived organic matter with no clear downhole trend. Elevated $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content is only observed in the sand y diamictite of lithostratigraphic Unit IV, Subunit VIA, and Unit VII, which also have higher magnetic susceptibility. Elemental ratios obtained by handheld portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) scans sho w good agreement with major lithostratigraphic units but also sugges t some deviations between chemical and lithologic boundaries.  

Downhole logging consisted of three separate tool runs (tripl e combo, FMS-sonic, and VSI), all of which reached the bottom of th e hole and proceeded without issue because of favorable borehol e conditions. The triple combo measured NGR, density, porosity, resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and borehole diameter. The calipe r data show that the borehole was in excellent condition, with onl y one washed out interval between 221 and $226~\mathrm{m}$ wireline matche d depth below seafloor (WMSF). The NGR, bulk density, and porosit y data match well with the data from core measurements, whereas th e magnetic susceptibility data do not correlate as well, possibly as  a result of temperature drift or other issues with the Magnetic Susceptibility Sonde (MSS). The second logging run consisted of th e FMS-sonic tool string to measure resistivity borehole images an d acoustic velocity. The latter shows good correlation with the dat a measured with the PWC, especially shallower than ${\sim}300\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. The FMS images are extremely well resolved and clearly show clast s in the diamictite intervals and a poorly recovered layered interval o f chert and mudstone in lithostratigraphic Unit V. The third loggin g run was with the VSI tool string (geophone) to conduct a vertica l seismic profile (VSP) experiment. Raw check shot data were used i n preliminary velocity models for an initial seismic-core-log correlation.  

# Site U1522  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1522 (proposed Site EBOCS-03C) is located in the Gloma r Challenger Basin at $76^{\circ}33.2262^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $174^{\circ}45.4652^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at $558\,\mathrm{~m~}$ wate r depth (Figure F12). During the middle Miocene, this site was located near the western edge of a wide embayment ${\sim}80\,\mathrm{km}$ south o f the present shelf break. Coring at this site was expected to recover  a sedimentary sequence that spans the late middle Miocene to th e Pleistocene (coinciding with RSU3 through RSU1). Coring targete d laminated and massive acoustic facies interpreted to be interlayere d stratified diamictite/mudstone and diatomite (glaciomarine/ope n marine) and massive diamictite, respectively (Figure F13).  

The upper ${\sim}400\mathrm{~m~}$ ( $1.2~\mathsf{s}$ two-way traveltime [TWT]) of sediment consists of tabular units (see Figure F3 in the Site U1522 chapter [McKay et al., 2019a]) that are interpreted to be aggradational subglacial till sheets deposited by a grounded ice sheet (i.e., compacted sediments) during the late Pleistocene (Alonso et al., 1992; De Santis et al, 1995). Underlying the till sheets is ${\sim}300\;\mathrm{m}$ of acoustically laminated facies interbedded with lens-shaped layers that ar e more transparent and interpreted to be glaciomarine or hemipelagic sediments and ice-proximal deposits (Böhm et al., 2009 ) (Figure F13). This site will enable us to determine if ice sheet–overriding events observed at ANDRILL Site AND-1B beneath th e modern Ross Ice Shelf advanced to the shelf edge and will therefor e help constrain the AIS contribution to Pliocene sea level lowstand s (Objective 1) (Naish et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2012). This site will also provide an opportunity to reconstruct the paleoceanographi c and paleoecological conditions during periods of glaciomarin e deposition at the outermost Ross Sea continental shelf (Objectiv e 2). These sequences, combined with downhole logging to fill in unrecovered sections, are anticipated to provide insights into the orbital controls on marine-based ice sheet extent (Objective 4).

# Operations  

After an $88\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1521 that averaged $10.7~\mathrm{kt}$ , the vessel arrived at Site U1522 at $0629\,\mathrm{h}$ $(\mathrm{UTC}+13\,\mathrm{h})$ ) on 22 January 2018. The original operations plan consisted of a single RC B hole to $545\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF; however, after requesting and receiving approva l from the Environmental Protection and Safety Panel (EPSP) an d Texas A&M Safety Panel, we ultimately cored Hole U1522A to 701. 8 m DSF (Cores 374-U1522A-1R through 76R) (Table T2). Core recovery was very poor from 0 to $203.2\textrm{m}$ DSF, was moderate fro m 203.2 to $424.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, and improved significantly below that depth. Hole cleaning became problematic near the end of coring operations, and off-bottom torque steadily increased despite multipl e heavy mud sweeps to clean the hole. At the end of coring operations, the hole was displaced with heavy mud $(10.5\ \mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{gal})$ an d logged with three tool strings: a modified triple combo, the VSI, an d the FMS. The Dipole Sonic Imager (DSI) was run on the tripl e combo instead of with the FMS, and the Hostile Environmen t Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS) was run without the source to measure borehole diameter with the caliper. Operations at Site U152 2 concluded at $1311\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 28 January. A total of $149.25\mathrm{~h~}$ (6.2 days ) were spent at Site U1522. RCB coring in Hole U1522A penetrated t o $701.8\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF and recovered $279.57\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(40\%)$ .  

# Principal results  

The $695.74\mathrm{~m~}$ succession of upper Miocene to recent sedimen t cored at Site U1522 is divided into four lithostratigraphic units $(\operatorname{I}-$  

IV). Unit III is further divided into Subunits IIIA–IIIC (Figure F14) . Several intervals are characterized by very poor recovery that consists primarily of washed gravel and fall-in, which compromises ou r ability to identify the lithologic variations in some units but may indicate the presence of unrecovered sand- or gravel-rich beds. Th e dominant facies throughout the cores is massive diatom-bearing/rich diamictite, although some intervals have thin beds of laminated  mudstone,  carbonate-cemented  mudstone,  and  mudd y diatomite.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I consists of ${\sim}200~\mathrm{m}$ of Pleistocene diatom-bearing/rich sandy mud, muddy sand, and clast-rich mudd y diamict. The upper ${\sim}3\textrm{m}$ of the unit is unconsolidated. Recovery i s poor between ${\sim}3$ and ${\sim}200\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A and consists primarily o f washed cobbles and gravel resulting from drilling disturbance.  A few recovered intervals contain massive diatom-bearing clast-ric h muddy diamict. The base of Unit I is defined by increased lithification of the diamict. Unit II consists of ${\sim}195\mathrm{~m~}$ of Pliocene massiv e interbedded  diatom-bearing/rich  sandy/muddy  diamictite  wit h mudstone laminae. Diatom-bearing mudstone and deformed (physically intermixed during deposition) discontinuous laminae to centimeter-scale beds are occasionally present in the muddy diamictite. Unit III $\left(\sim\!250\,\textrm{m}\right)$ includes upper Miocene muddy diatomite an d diatom-bearing/rich diamictite and is divided into three subunit s based on the style of interbedding and presence of lithologic accessories. Clasts occur throughout, but clast assemblage and composition changes between subunits. Subunit IIIA consists of massiv e bioturbated muddy diatomite with glauconite and interbedde d massive diatom-rich sandy/muddy diamictite with small $(<\!1{\mathrm{~\,~cm}})$ mudstone  clasts.  Subunit  IIIB  consists  of  diatom-bearin g sandy/muddy diamictite with intervals of mudstone. Subunit III C consists of diatom-bearing sandy/muddy diamictite. Some interval s contain stratification characterized by laminations to thin mudstone beds and changes in matrix color. Although the recovere d succession contains diverse clast lithologies throughout, basal t clasts are only common in Subunit IIIC, suggesting a switch in provenance at that time. The base of Subunit IIIC is defined by interbed s of stratified and massive diamictite and diatom-bearing/rich mudstone. Unit IV consists of ${\sim}50\;\mathrm{m}$ of upper Miocene interbedded diatom-bearing sandy diamictite and muddy diatomite.

Micropaleontological investigations were performed on all cor e catcher samples and two additional samples from split core section s to obtain biostratigraphic ages and preliminary paleoenvironmenta l information through examination of diatom, radiolarian, foraminifer, and palynomorph assemblages. Abundance and preservation o f the different microfossil groups strongly varies throughout the sequence. In general, all microfossil groups are rare and comprise  a combination of in situ and reworked taxa in the upper ${\sim}200\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF  

A. Diatoms and radiolarians are more abundant between $\mathord{\sim}200$ an d $400\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, and dinoflagellates are common in the lower part o f that interval. Deeper than ${\sim}400\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, radiolarians are absen t and palynomorphs and foraminifers are sparse. The diatom assemblage between ${\sim}400$ and $480\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A is poorly preserved and primarily reworked, whereas deeper than ${\sim}480\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, diato m assemblages are mixed, with a few intervals of well-preserved diverse assemblages interspersed with mostly fragmented sparse assemblages (Figure F14).  

The mudline sample contains a modern low-diversity radiolarian assemblage that is typical of the Antarctic continental shel f and includes mainly Antarctissa spp. together with significant numbers of Rhizoplegma boreale and the Phormacantha hystrix/Plectacantha oikiskos group. Below the mudline sample, the upper $\mathord{\sim}200$ m CSF-A is tentatively assigned a Pleistocene age; however, th e combination of sparse microfossils and mix of in situ and reworke d taxa hinders straightforward age assignment and environmental reconstructions (Figure F14). Calcareous benthic foraminifers ar e represented by few specimens of typical late Neogene Ross Sea shel f species, although many of the specimens are likely reworked. On e sample at ${\sim}135\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A contains a well-preserved assemblage tha t includes  the  planktonic  foraminifer  Neogloboquadrina  pachyderma.  

The interval between ${\sim}200$ and $400\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A is assigned a Pliocene age based on diatoms and radiolarians, which were critical fo r providing age constraints at this site (Figure F14). One sample fro m ${\sim}400\,\mathrm{~m~}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ contains well-preserved diatom, radiolarian, an d dinocyst taxa that are indicative of high-productivity environmenta l conditions that were warmer than today. From ${\sim}400$ to $480\;\mathrm{m}$ CSFA, microfossil assemblages are sparse and poorly preserved, and reworking makes age assignment and environmental reconstruction s difficult. Deeper than ${\sim}490\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , the absence of the diato m Thalassiosira torokina indicates a late Miocene age older than $9\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . From ${\sim}490~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to the base of the cored interval at $695.74\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, diatom and dinocyst assemblages suggest an expanded upper Miocene sequence. A few samples from this interval contai n well-preserved, diverse dinocyst assemblages that include the lat e Miocene species Selenopemphix bothrion (Harland and Pudsey, 2002). This assemblage suggests high productivity, likely with reduced sea ice relative to present day.  

Paleomagnetic investigations primarily focused on measurements of archive-half core sections to determine ChRM and construct a magnetostratigraphy. The NRM of most archive-half cor e sections was measured before and after progressive AF demagnetization, usually in $5~\mathrm{mT}$ increments to $20~\mathrm{mT}.$ NRM intensity commonly  decreases  by  approximately  one  order  of  magnitud e throughout this demagnetization sequence and in general agree s with magnetic susceptibility measured with the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) and Section Half Multisensor Logge r (SHMSL). NRM inclinations are predominantly positive prior to demagnetization and reveal scattered clusters of normal and reverse d polarity after $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ peak AF demagnetization.  

Discrete samples were used to test the fidelity of the archive-hal f NRM measurements by progressive demagnetization in $2~\mathrm{mT}$ step s to $20\,\mathrm{mT}$ , $5\;\mathrm{mT}$ steps to $60\;\mathrm{mT}_{\mathrm{a}}$ , and $10\,\mathrm{mT}$ steps to $80\,\mathrm{mT}$ . The NR M directions of a majority of these discrete samples quickly becom e erratic, but several samples contain a stable direction that matche s the archive-half directions. The normal and reversed polarity zone s identified in both archive halves and discrete samples cannot yet b e confidently correlated to the GPTS with the available biostratigraphic age control; postcruise work to refine the biostratigraph y should improve the correlation. Discrete samples were also used t o measure the AMS to determine magnetic fabric characteristics.  

Physical property measurements were conducted on all core s collected. In general, the whole-round core bulk density and magnetic susceptibility measurements show trends similar to thos e from discrete MAD samples and point measurements of magneti c susceptibility on the section halves (Figure F14). Overall, downhol e trends in magnetic susceptibility, NGR, bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, and porosity correspond well with the defined lithostratigraphi c units. In general, higher magnetic susceptibility corresponds t o higher NGR, bulk density, and $P$ -wave velocity and lower porosit y and is likely related to the dominance of a mud-rich matrix in th e diamict/diamictite recovered at this site. NGR, density, and $P$ -wav e velocity are lower in lithostratigraphic Unit II (diatom-bearing/ric h sandy/muddy diamictite) relative to Units III and IV, possibly indicating a change in the clast or matrix composition. In Subunits III B and IIIC and Unit IV, variations in physical properties are related t o lithology (muddy diatomite and mudstone versus sandy/muddy diamictite) and the relative abundance of diatoms, mud clasts, carbonate nodules, and basalt clasts. In these units, higher magneti c susceptibility, NGR, density, and $P$ -wave velocity and lower porosit y correspond  to  higher  proportions  of  basalt  and/or  metasedimentary clasts and diatom-bearing lithologies. Lower magneti c susceptibility, NGR, density, and $P$ -wave velocity and higher porosity correspond to higher proportions of mud clasts, carbonate nodules, and diatom-rich to diatomite lithologies.  

Headspace gases are low in the uppermost $100{-}200\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF- A but display variable methane and increasing ethane concentration s from ${\sim}200\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A to the bottom of the hole. Interstitial wate r analyses of the mudline and five whole-round samples indicate earl y diagenesis immediately below the sediment/water interface, wit h sulfate reduction in the upper $100\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ and manganese reduction downhole to $215.40\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. TOC and $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ contents ar e generally low ( $_{<0.6}$ and ${<}3.5\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ , respectively). Carbonate conten t increases slightly downhole, with generally higher values betwee n ${\sim}400$ and $630\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Figure F14). The slightly elevated carbonate content and decreasing TOC/TN ratio between ${\sim}400$ and $630\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A may suggest more open-marine conditions during deposition of the diamictite of lithostratigraphic Unit III compared wit h Units I and II. Systematic variations in pXRF data indicate the potential for detailed reconstruction of sediment provenance, particularly in Units II–IV.  

Downhole logging consisted of three tool strings: a modified triple combo with the sonic tool and without the source in the densit y tool, the VSI to conduct a VSP experiment, and the FMS. The modified triple combo tool string measured borehole diameter, NGR, resistivity, sonic velocity, and magnetic susceptibility. It reache d $650.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ wireline logging depth below seafloor (WSF), or ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{~m~}$ above the bottom of the hole. Caliper data show that the borehol e size varied significantly, with numerous washed out intervals an d multiple ledges, which resulted in the VSI and FMS tool string s reaching only $297.5\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF}$ .  

Despite lower quality borehole conditions than those at Sit e U1521, downhole data generally match well with results from cor e measurements. NGR data from downhole logging show good correspondence with NGR data from whole-round cores, whereas corebased $P$ -wave velocity consistently underestimates velocity relativ e to the downhole log data even though the general trends are similar. Alongside other downhole logging data sets, the FMS resistivity images appear to be of reasonable quality and should help assess lithologies in the poorly recovered upper part of the formation. Chec k shot data were successfully collected at eight depths with the VS I tool (geophone). Raw check shot data were used in preliminary velocity models for initial core-log-seismic integration.  

# Site U1523  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1523 (proposed Site RSCR-14A) is located on the southeastern flank of the Iselin Bank, ${\sim}50~\mathrm{km}$ northwest of the Pennell Basin, at $74^{\circ}9.02^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}47.70^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at $828\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figure F15) . The site is on the outermost continental shelf edge and lies beneat h the modern-day ASC (Orsi and Wiederwohl, 2009). The targete d sediments are drift deposits characterized by stratified, parallel seismic reflectors with high to medium amplitudes (Figure F16). Undulations in the seafloor and subseafloor reflectors occur toward th e top of the bank, $12\,\mathrm{km}$ west of Site U1523, and are interpreted to b e from iceberg scouring (see Figure F2 in the Site U1523 chapte r [McKay et al., 2019b]). The scour marks crosscut into the younges t strata, and iceberg keels ploughing into this sediment may act to remobilize sediment deposited on the bank. Farther west $(\sim\!80\ \mathrm{km})$ ,

seismic-reflection profiles show flat-topped ridges interpreted t o represent grounding-zone wedges (see Figure F4 in the Site U152 3 chapter [McKay et al., 2019b]). Ice sheet models suggest that thes e likely formed during the Last Glacial Maximum as a consequence o f eastward ice flow from an ice divide forming on the bathymetri c high of the Pennell Bank (Golledge et al., 2013). Consequently, sediment supply at this site could arise from a combination of sources, including  

• Icebergs and suspended sediment from the east through the ASC,   
• Downslope delivery by glacial outwash and glaciogenic debris flows at the margin of an ice sheet grounded on northernmost Pennell Bank west of the site and remobilized/winnowed by along-slope currents,   
• Downslope delivery by suspended sediment scoured by icebergs west of the site, and   
• Pelagic/hemipelagic sedimentation.  

Bottom currents associated with the ASC in this region ar e modeled to be between ${\sim}10$ and $20~\,\mathrm{cm/s}$ (Padman and Fricker, 2005), and winnowing of fines is expected during periods of enhanced bottom-current flow. Jacobs et al. (1974) reported strong diurnal signals and average and maximum velocities of ${>}17$ an d ${>}40\,\mathrm{cm/s}$ , respectively, at $4\,\mathrm{m}$ above the seafloor in 527–1201 m water depth in the Ross Sea.  

The primary objective of Site U1523 was to recover a high-resolution record that can be correlated with inner and outer shelf records of ice sheet advance and retreat (e.g., Site U1522 an d ANDRILL Site AND-1B; Naish et al., 2009) and used to reconstruc t fluctuations in the ASC during the Neogene and Quaternary (Objective 3). Drilling at Site U1523 therefore aimed to sample the upper sedimentary section above RSU4 to achieve this objective. Th e record of deposition and winnowing beneath the ASC from Sit e U1523 will enable testing of the hypothesis that changes in th e strength of this wind-driven ocean current regulated the southwar d transport of warm CDW onto the Ross Sea continental shelf durin g past ice sheet retreat events. Another objective is the reconstructio n of ice-proximal oceanic temperatures and surface water propertie s during periods of pelagic/hemipelagic sedimentation. This reconstruction will constrain the magnitude of polar amplification durin g past warm periods of the Neogene and Quaternary (Objective 2). An additional objective is to identify processes that govern sediment transfer between the outermost continental shelf and the upper continental slope/rise.  

# Operations  

After a $147\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1522 that averaged $11.5\;\mathrm{kt}$ , the vessel arrived at Site U1523 at $0158\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{(UTC+13\,h)}$ ) on 29 January 2018. This alternate site was occupied after coring at Site U152 2 demonstrated that core recovery would likely be poor in the targeted upper interval of the original proposed primary Site EBOCS04B. We planned to core two holes at Site U1523: one cored with th e APC system to refusal, followed by an APC/XCB hole to $450\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Instead, we ultimately cored five holes because difficult coring conditions required additional holes to achieve the objectives (Tabl e T2). Prior to coring, we conducted a seafloor camera survey to ensure we could avoid large rocks. The survey included tagging th e seafloor at four potential hole locations.  

Hole U1523A was cored with a combination of the APC an d HLAPC systems to $46.3~\mathrm{m}$ DSF, where we were unable to land th e HLAPC core barrel. The hole was terminated, and we pulled th e drill string above the seafloor to try to clean out the bottom-hol e assembly (BHA). After we were unable to reestablish circulatio n through the drill string, we had to pull the pipe back to the surfac e to clean the debris (rocks and sand/gravel) from the BHA. The debris was curated as a ghost core. The APC/XCB BHA was reassembled and run back to the seafloor, and Hole U1523B was cored to  a total depth of $164.4~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Toward the end of coring operations i n Hole U1523B, hole cleaning became a problem, and off-botto m torque steadily increased despite efforts to clean the hole. In addition, rotary coring with the XCB system yielded very poor recovery, so we terminated operations in Hole U1523B with the intention o f using the HLAPC system in Hole U1523C to target specific stratigraphic gaps not recovered in Holes U1523A and U1523B. Afte r pulling clear of the seafloor from Hole U1523B, it became apparen t that our ability to circulate through the bit jets was compromised. After attempting to clear the bit jets, we started Hole U1523C an d drilled without coring to $43.3~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. At that depth, we completel y lost circulation through the drill string and were forced to terminat e operations and pull the drill string back to the rig floor.  

We then decided to use the RCB system to core and log to a t least $300\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Hole U1523D was drilled without coring from th e seafloor to $135.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. RCB coring then penetrated from $135.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF to a total depth of $307.8\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. We opted not to deepen th e hole farther because of very poor recovery $(0.9\;\mathrm{m};<\!1\%)$ . At the en d of coring operations, the hole was displaced with heavy mud (10. 5 $1\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{gal})$ and logged with two tool strings: a modified triple comb o and the FMS. The DSI was run on the triple combo instead of wit h the FMS, and the HLDS was run without the source for borehol e diameter measurement with the caliper. After logging was completed, we used the APC and HLAPC systems to spot core in Hol e U1523E to cover stratigraphic gaps from Holes U1523A an d U1523B. Hole U1523E was successfully spot cored to $130.8\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. After coring was completed, the drill string was recovered, and th e

rig floor was secured at $0547\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 February, ending Hole U1523 E and Site U1523. A total of $147.5~\mathrm{h}$ (6.15 days) were spent at Sit e U1523.  

We collected a total of 64 cores at Site U1523. The APC corin g system was deployed 5 times, recovering $41.57\,\mathrm{m}$ of sediment $(91\%)$ . The HLAPC coring system was used 33 times, collecting $87.99\mathrm{~m~}$ $(59\%)$ . The XCB coring system collected $3.16~\mathrm{m}$ of core $(5\%)$ over  8 cores. The RCB system was deployed 18 times over $172.8\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , recovering $0.9\textrm{m}(0.5\%)$ (Table T2).  

# Principal results  

The upper ${\sim}155\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment recovered at Site U1523 is divided into three lithostratigraphic units (I–III) dated to the lat e Miocene–Pleistocene (Figure F17). Deeper than $\mathord{\sim}155\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A , poor recovery in Hole U1523D precluded definition of lithostratigraphic units. Several intervals shallower than $155\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A ar e characterized by poor recovery, fall-in, and washed gravel, whic h compromises our ability to identify lithologic variations and som e contacts between units but may indicate the presence of unrecovered sand- and/or gravel-rich beds. Where recovered, the contact s between units are mostly sharp. The major lithologies at Site U152 3 are diatom-bearing/rich mud, foraminifer-bearing muddy sand, muddy diatom ooze, and diatom-bearing/rich diamict. These facie s reflect open-marine to ice-proximal depositional environments o n the outer Ross Sea continental shelf since the late Miocene.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I consists of ${\sim}35\mathrm{~m~}$ of Pleistocene massive bioturbated to laminated greenish gray to grayish brown diatom-bearing/rich mud interbedded at the decimeter scale wit h foraminifer-bearing muddy sand and diamict. Large clasts of diverse lithologies, mud clasts, and pyrite staining occur throughout, and shell fragments and lignite are observed in some intervals. Th e base of Unit I is defined by a decrease in foraminifer abundance an d an increase in diatom abundance. Unit II is a ${\sim}60\;\mathrm{m}$ thick sequenc e of Pliocene to Pleistocene massive to laminated diatom-bearing/rich mud to muddy diatom ooze interbedded at the decimete r to meter scale with massive gray to greenish gray diamict. Glauconite is common in sand beds. Pyrite staining, lithic and mud clasts, shell fragments, bryozoans, and worm tubes were also observed. Unit III includes ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{m}$ of upper Miocene massive to laminated pal e green, grayish green, and dark gray diatom-bearing/rich mud interbedded at the decimeter scale with greenish gray diatom-bearin g diamict. Unit III is similar to Unit II but is distinguished by a decrease in biogenics and an increase in siliciclastics relative to Unit II.  

Core catcher samples from Holes U1523A, U1523B, U1523D , and U1523E were examined for siliceous (diatoms, radiolarians, silicoflagellates, ebridians, and chrysophycean cysts), calcareous (foraminifers), and organic (dinocysts and other aquatic palynomorphs, pollen, and spores) microfossils. Diatom remains were encountere d in all samples, and radiolarians are generally rare, but several intervals record higher abundance and better preservation that provid e important biostratigraphic control, especially for the upper Miocene (Figure F17). A distinctive modern open-ocean radiolarian assemblage is present in the mudline sample of this site, contrastin g with the coastal assemblage present in the mudline sample fro m Site U1522. Organic and calcareous microfossils occur sporadicall y throughout the entire recovered sequence. Dinocysts are often rare, except in the upper Pliocene and upper Miocene intervals. Foraminifers are most abundant in the upper Pleistocene. A uniqu e monospecific assemblage of agglutinated benthic foraminifers wa s observed in the upper Miocene of Holes U1523B and U1523E.  

Diatoms, radiolarians, and dinocysts provide a sequence of biostratigraphic datums that allow for correlation across holes and development of a composite age model. Three broad stratigraphi c intervals separated by disconformities correspond generally t o lithostratigraphic units and represent deposition of the followin g intervals (Figure F17):  

• An upper Pleistocene interval composed largely of mixed and reworked sediments (corresponding to lithostratigraphic Unit I),   
• An upper Pliocene to lower Pleistocene interval (Unit II) with sediment accumulation rates approaching $23\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ of diatomrich mud and diatom ooze, and   
• An upper middle Miocene to upper Miocene interval (Unit III).  

Paleomagnetic analyses focused on constructing a magnetostratigraphy using ChRM directions. The NRM of archive-half cor e sections was measured before and after progressive AF demagnetization in $5\;\mathrm{mT}$ steps to $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ . NRM intensities prior to demagnetization are mostly ${\sim}10^{-1}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ and agree well with WRMSL, SHMSL, and Kappabridge magnetic susceptibility values. This agreemen t suggests that all of these parameters are approximately equally influenced by magnetic concentration, which seems to be relativel y constant throughout all three lithostratigraphic units. NRM inclinations are predominantly positive prior to demagnetization bu t group in clusters of normal and reversed polarity after AF demagnetization. Discrete samples were used to test the fidelity of the archive-half NRM measurements in a 20 step AF demagnetizatio n sequence. At least three components are present with variable coercivities: a viscous remanent magnetization, a drilling overprint, an d a third component with higher coercivity that most likely carries th e ChRM.  

The normal and reversed polarity zones identified in both archive halves and discrete samples are correlated to the GPTS usin g constraints from biostratigraphic datums. These tie points allow u s to tentatively identify the tops of Subchron C2An.1n and Chron s C2n and C4An. AMS measurements on discrete samples demonstrate that the magnetic fabric is often oblate. However, $k_{\mathrm{min}}$ inclinations ${<}60^{\circ}$ also occur and coincide with intervals of coarser grai n sizes, suggesting a change in compaction in these intervals relativ e to fine-grained intervals.  

Physical property measurements generally show that wholeround core bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, and $P$ -wave velocity measurements are in good agreement with discrete MAD samples and point measurements of magnetic susceptibility and $P$ -wav e velocity on section halves (Figure F17). Downhole changes in physical properties are in good overall agreement with the defined lithostratigraphic units based on sedimentological characteristics, an d changes in physical properties can provide insight into lithologi c variations in each unit. Magnetic susceptibility is highly variable i n lithostratigraphic Unit I and corresponds to alternating sandy an d muddy layers with abundant clasts and muddy diamict. Bulk densit y increases downhole and is anticorrelated with porosity, which decreases downhole in Unit I, suggesting compaction. Deeper tha n Unit I, bulk density and porosity show significant variation tha t likely reflects diatom content. For instance, low bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, and NGR in the middle of Unit II $({\sim}60{-}70\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) correspond to diatom-rich mud intervals. Relatively hig h and stable NGR measurements in Unit III indicate relatively hig h clay mineral content in the massive bioturbated to laminated diatom-bearing mud and sandy mud.

Figure F17. Site U1523 summary. Preliminary environmental interpretation is based on microfossils.  

Headspace gas concentrations of methane and ethane are clos e to and below the detection limit, respectively. In addition to lowresolution interstitial water sampling ( ${\sim}1$ sample per core or ever y other half-length core) throughout Holes U1523A, U1523B, an d U1523E, a high-resolution profile of interstitial water chemistry wa s obtained for the upper $8.1\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ in Hole U1523B. Low-resolution downhole trends suggest manganese and sulfate reduction i n the suboxic to anoxic transition zone $\mathrm{\left({\sim}130\mathrm{\;m}\,C S F{-}A\right)}$ (Figure F17). Rapid increases in silicon and manganese concentration in the upper $\sim\!2\textrm{m}$ probably reflects shallow diagenesis of silica. Bulk sediment TOC and $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ contents are generally low $(<\!0.6\$ and $^{<2.5}$ $\mathrm{wt\%}$ , respectively). TOC content is generally slightly lower in th e diatom-bearing mud and diamict of Unit III. Higher carbonate content (up to ${\sim}15\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) is observed in foraminifer-bearing sandy mu d in lithostratigraphic Units I and II. The TOC/TN ratio does not display a discernible trend and suggests mixed input of marine and terrestrially derived organic matter. pXRF data indicate lower an d more invariant $\mathrm{Ba}/\mathrm{Al}$ ratio compared with Sites U1521 and U1522. In contrast, significant downhole variations are observed in ratios o f refractory elements such as $\mathrm{Th}/\mathrm{Ti}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , which alongside ratios like Fe/T i may serve as a provenance proxy at this site (Figure F17).  

Downhole logging in Hole U1523D consisted of two tool strings: a modified triple combo with the sonic tool and without the sourc e in the density tool and the FMS. The modified triple combo measured borehole diameter, NGR, resistivity, sonic velocity, and magnetic susceptibility. The modified triple combo tool string reache d $292\textrm{m}$ WSF, $\sim\!15\mathrm{~m~}$ above the total borehole depth, and the FM S tool string reached $289.6\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF}$ Downhole logging data will be ke y for interpreting lithologic variation deeper than $155\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A i n Hole U1523D, where overall core recovery was very poor $\left(0.5\%\right)$ , and in poorly recovered intervals in the upper parts of the site. Although the caliper data identified a number of minor washouts, borehole conditions were reasonable, and the log data show goo d correspondence with the core data over the ${\sim}80\,\mathrm{m}$ of overlap. Interestingly, although the trends and relative changes in magnitude o f the NGR log data are similar to those from the cores, the core dat a are higher than those measured in situ. On the other hand, corebased $P$ -wave velocity data are consistently lower than those fro m the downhole sonic log. The resistivity data show clear alternation s of high and low resistivity throughout the borehole that may correspond to alternating layers of fine and coarse sediments. These alterations are also apparent in the FMS resistivity images togethe r with localized high-resistivity spots that are interpreted to be clast s in diamict.

Site U1524 (proposed Site RSCR-10A) is located on the continental rise at $74^{\circ}13.05^{\prime}\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , $173^{\circ}37.98^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at $2394\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth on th e southeastern levee of the Hillary Canyon (Figure F18; see also Figure F3 in the Site U1524 chapter [McKay et al., 2019c]).

this site has a relief of ${\sim}500\mathrm{~m~}$ and is located ${\sim}120~\mathrm{km}$ north of th e Ross Sea continental shelf edge. The head of the Hillary Canyon system is located at the mouths of the Pennell Basin and Glomar Challenger Basin. The Hillary Canyon is one of the largest conduits fo r newly formed Ross Sea Bottom Water (RSBW; a type of AABW), which is focused in this channel by dense water formed on the Ros s Sea continental shelf cascading through the troughs and down th e continental slope and rise (Bergamasco et al., 2002; Orsi and Wiederwohl, 2009). The site also lies beneath the modern-day westward-flowing  ASC  (Figure  F5).  The  targeted  sediments  ar e interpreted from seismic-reflection profiles to be channel-overspill and drift deposits characterized by stratified, parallel seismic reflectors with high to medium amplitude (Figure F19; see Figure F3 i n the Site U1524 chapter [McKay et al., 2019c]).  

The primary objectives of Site U1524 were to obtain a near-continuous post-RSU3 (upper Miocene to Pleistocene) and pre-RSU 3 (middle to upper Miocene) sediment sequence to provide a highresolution chronology and an ice-distal record of glacial–interglacial cycles. The continental rise location of Site U1524 should allo w a more complete assessment of oceanic response to AIS variability. The record of deposition at Site U1524 was anticipated to be primarily influenced by RSBW flowing down the Hillary Canyon. Consequently, this site will enable assessment of the oceanographi c influence on ice sheet variability and bottom water production (Objective 2). The direct record obtained at Site U1524 of AABW flo w down the Hillary Canyon could potentially be extrapolated to highfidelity paleoceanographic records farther afield in the abyssal Pacific Ocean to better constrain the Antarctic influences on th e global oceanic deep circulation. The Hillary Canyon is also a mai n route for glacial sediments eroded and transported by ice stream s from the innermost continental shelf to its edge, and provenanc e studies of the terrigenous sediment may allow for identification o f changing ice sheet drainage pathways through the Neogene an d Quaternary. Because Site U1524 is near the crest of the levee of th e Hillary Canyon, it will also provide a high-resolution record for doc

umenting the deep-sea response to ice sheet change on the continental shelf, which is recorded in the Ross Sea inner (ANDRILL Sit e AND-1B; Naish et al., 2009) and outer (Site U1522) continenta l shelf. IRD could be sourced by icebergs calving from the Ross Se a and/or transported from the east by the ASC, which provides  a proxy for dynamic ice discharge from the Pacific coastline sector o f the WAIS. Pelagic sediments deposited during periods of high productivity or a lull in turbidity current overspill deposition will provide a record of surface-water properties, including sea ice cover, SST, stratification, salinity, productivity, and warmer water incursions during superinterglacials. These proxy records will enable u s to assess the magnitude of polar amplification during past warm climates (Objective 2) and the role of oceanic forcing of ice sheet retreat  or  advance  at  these  times  (Objective  3).  In  addition, continuous deposition was anticipated at this site through much o f the Neogene and Quaternary to allow for assessment of the orbital response of the WAIS and adjacent oceanic/biological system over  a range of past climatic conditions (Objective 4).  

# Operations  

After a $52\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1523 that averaged 11.1 kt, th e vessel arrived at Site U1524 at $1027\,\mathrm{h}$ $(\mathrm{UTC}+13\,\mathrm{h})$ on 4 Februar y 2018. This site is an alternate site for primary proposed Site RSCR02B. We decided to occupy the alternate site because the highes t priority target is shallower, the seismic facies show less evidence fo r transported sediment, and the sea ice edge was farther away. Th e original plan called for three holes, one cored to refusal with th e APC system followed by an APC/XCB hole to $350\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The thir d hole was to be cored to $1000\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF with the RCB system and the n logged with three tool strings. We ultimately cored three holes (Table T2). Hole U1524A was cored with the APC/XCB system t o $299.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Hole U1524B consists of a single mudline core collected for high-resolution interstitial water and microbiology sampling. Hole U1524C is an RCB hole cored to $441.9\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF.  

Hole U1524A was cored to APC refusal at $270.3\textrm{m}$ DSF, afte r which we deployed the HLAPC system. The first HLAPC core advanced only $_{0.4\mathrm{~m~}}$ to $270.7\,\textrm{m}$ DSF, indicating HLAPC refusal. Downhole formation temperatures were taken on Cores 374- U1524A-6H $\mathrm{^51.5~m}$ DSF), 9H $\mathrm{{80.0\m}}$ DSF), 12H ( $108.5\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF), and 15H $\mathrm{137~m~DSF)}$ ) using the advanced piston corer temperatur e tool (APCT-3). Following HLAPC refusal, we deployed the XC B system and cored to $299.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, but each XCB core returned wit h a shattered liner and highly disturbed sediment. At that point, w e terminated coring and pulled out of the hole because of approaching sea ice. After pulling out of the hole, enough time remained t o collect a single mudline core (Hole U1524B) for high-resolution interstitial water and microbiological studies. After terminating coring in Hole U1524B, we retrieved the drill string and departed Sit e U1524 at $2030~\mathrm{h}$ on 6 February. With sea ice estimated to remai n over Site U1524 for at least 2 days, we opted to occupy Site U152 5 (proposed Site RSCR-03A), located only $47~\mathrm{nmi}$ away but in a position south of the sea ice edge. After ice monitoring determined tha t the sea ice was moving away from Site U1524, we ended operation s at Site U1525 at $0535\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 February to return to Site U1524. Afte r arriving back at Site U1524 at $1006\,\mathrm{h}$ , we prepared for RCB corin g operations in Hole U1524C. While deploying the drill string, w e lowered the subsea camera to retrieve the beacon, which had faile d to release when abandoning the site. After retrieving the beacon, Hole U1524C was drilled without coring to $260.5~\mathrm{m}$ DSF and the n RCB cored to $441.9\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, where we were forced to terminate operations because of a mechanical breakdown of the port stern tub e shaft and arrangement that ended Expedition 374 science operations. The rig floor was secured for transit at $1835\,\mathrm{h}$ on 11 February, ending Site U1524. Total time spent at Site U1524 was $117.25\,\mathrm{h}$ (4. 9 days).  

We collected a total of 54 cores at Site U1524. The APC syste m was deployed 31 times, collecting $284.17\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(102\%)$ . Th e HLAPC system was deployed once, recovering $0.43\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of cor e $(108\%)$ . The XCB system collected $5.51\textrm{m}$ over 3 cores $(19\%)$ . Th e RCB system was used 19 times, collecting $19.2\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(11\%)$ (Table T2).  

# Principal results  

Site U1524 includes three holes; the deepest hole was cored t o $441.9\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. The recovered upper Miocene to Pleistocene sediment is divided into three lithostratigraphic units (I–III). Unit I i s divided into three subunits (IA, IB, and IC) (Figure F20). Contact s between units and subunits are mostly gradational and are distinguished by gradual changes in diatom content. The major lithologies at Site U1524 are diatom-bearing/rich mud/sandy mud, muddy diatom ooze, and muddy diamict. The assemblage of facie s reflects pelagic sedimentation with ice rafting and winnowing/redeposition by downslope and along-slope processes. The sediment recovered at Site U1524 reveals current reworking superimposed o n variations in siliciclastic and biogenic sediment supply since the lat e Miocene on the upper continental rise of the Ross Sea.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I consists of ${\sim}200\,\mathrm{m}$ of upper Pliocene t o Pleistocene unconsolidated interbedded massive to laminated diatom-bearing/rich mud/sandy mud and muddy diatom ooze. A gradual downhole increase in diatom content characterizes this unit an d was used to distinguish three subunits based on increasing percentage of biogenic material. Subunit IA consists of ${\sim}78\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of interbedded massive to laminated light yellowish brown to brow n diatom-bearing/rich mud and greenish gray diatom-bearing/ric h sandy mud with dispersed to common clasts. Sand laminae an d lenses are increasingly abundant toward the base of the unit. A 2 0 cm thick volcanic ash layer is present in Subunit IA. The base of thi s subunit is marked by a transition from olive gray diatom-rich mu d to interbedded greenish gray diatom-rich mud and sandy mud. Subunit IB ( $\cdot\sim\!78\mathrm{~m~}$ thick) consists of interbedded olive gray and greenish gray diatom-rich mud/sandy mud and muddy diatom ooze wit h dispersed clasts. Millimeter-scale silty to sandy laminations increase downhole in this subunit. The base of Subunit IB is define d by an increase in thickness and frequency of sandy mud beds. Subunit IC consists of ${\sim}45\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of interbedded olive gray diatom-ric h mud and muddy diatom ooze that is similar to Subunit IB but features an increase in the biogenic component, thinner greenish gra y diatom-rich mud and muddy ooze, and thicker beds of diatom-ric h sandy mud with dispersed clasts. Pyrite staining is present throughout. The boundary between Units I and II is marked by a sharp contact between diatom-rich mud and muddy diatom ooze. Unit I I consists of ${\sim}117\,\mathrm{m}$ of massive to laminated olive gray muddy diato m ooze interbedded with bioturbated to laminated greenish gray diatom ooze and diatom-rich sandy mud. The olive gray muddy diato m ooze beds include pyrite staining and sand/silt laminations, and th e greenish gray diatom ooze beds contain more intense bioturbation. The contact between Units II and III is defined by the first downhole occurrence of massive diamict. Unit III ( $^{120}\,\mathrm{m}$ thick) consist s of massive to laminated dark greenish gray mud interbedded wit h massive greenish gray diatom-rich sandy mud with dispersed clast s of muddy diamict, as well as muddy diatom ooze. The lower contacts of the sandy mud beds are gradational and bioturbated.  

A total of 47 core catcher samples from Holes U1524A an d U1524C were analyzed for siliceous (diatoms, radiolarians, silicoflagellates, ebridians, and chrysophycean cysts), calcareous (foraminifers), and organic (dinocysts and other aquatic palynomorphs, pollen, and spores) microfossils. The mudline and core catcher samples from Core 374-U1524B-1H were also examined. The occurrence and abundance of the different microfossil groups varie s greatly throughout the Site U1524 sediment column. Rich assemblages of diatoms occur throughout, whereas radiolarians are generally rare but common to abundant in several samples, particularl y in the lower Pliocene and Miocene intervals where they provid e valuable biostratigraphic control (Figure F20). Foraminifers an d palynomorphs are generally sparse.  

Although all investigated microfossil groups supply valuable information, radiolarians and diatoms provide well-constrained agediagnostic taxa that were used to develop an age-depth model fo r the site (Figure F20). Reworking and mixing of diatom assemblage s of multiple ages limited the biostratigraphic utility of diatoms fro m the seafloor to ${\sim}80\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. The underlying stratigraphic sequence can be assigned to several biostratigraphic zones that ar e sometimes bounded by unconformities that also correspond to th e lithostratigraphic unit boundaries. The ${\sim}80{-}120\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A interval is dated to the early Pleistocene. Deeper than $120\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ is a n ${\sim}160\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick Pliocene interval rich in diatoms. A disconformit y representing more than $1.0\,\mathrm{My}$ is interpreted between ${\sim}273$ and 28 3 m CSF-A. An ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ thick interval of lower Pliocene sediment between ${\sim}283$ and $310\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A overlies another disconformity interpreted between ${\sim}310$ and $^{320}\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Sediment deeper than thi s hiatus is dated to older than $8.5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (late Miocene), and the deepes t sample from the site $..437\mathrm{~m}$ CSF-A) is dated to younger than 1 0 Ma.

Paleomagnetic investigations primarily focused on generating  a magnetostratigraphy to assist with establishing a chronostratigraphy. NRM measurements were generally conducted prior to an d after AF demagnetization with peak fields of 10 and $20~\mathrm{mT}$ Initia l NRM intensities oscillate around $\mathord{\sim}10^{-1}$ to $10^{-3}\,\,\mathrm{A/m}$ and decreas e after demagnetization to $\mathrm{\sim}10^{-2}$ to $10^{-5}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ . These oscillations agre e well with variations in magnetic susceptibility, suggesting that magnetic particle concentration has a comparable effect on these parameters and potentially decreases downhole. After removal of th e drilling-induced, downward-directed overprint, inclinations cluste r in generally steep upward and downward directions. These cluster s represent normal and reversed polarity zones, respectively, that ca n be tied to the GPTS using independent biostratigraphic datums. W e identified all normal and reversed (sub)chrons between Chron C1 n (Brunhes; $0{-}0.781\ \mathrm{Ma}_{_{\star}}$ ) and the top of Subchron C2An.2r (3.20 7 Ma). Magnetic fabric experiments were also conducted to check fo r subtle disturbances that may yield unreliable directions and for differential compaction in the different lithostratigraphic units. Generally, most samples have an undisturbed oblate fabric, which i s common in sedimentary settings, but the degree of anisotropy i s variable between lithostratigraphic units and may relate to factor s such as differences in sedimentation rate.  

Physical properties measurements were conducted on wholeround cores from Holes U1524A and U1524C, with additional measurements on split-core sections and discrete samples. In general, data from whole-round measurements show trends similar to thos e from split-core measurements. A small deviation between wholeround measurements of GRA bulk density and $P$ -wave velocit y compared with discrete measurements deeper than ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF- A in Hole U1524A is likely due to core expansion generated by degassing during the equilibration of the cores to room temperature. Downhole changes in physical properties are in good overall agreement with the defined lithostratigraphic units based on sedimentological characteristics, and changes in physical properties ca n provide insight into lithologic changes in each unit.  

Overall, there is a good correlation between magnetic susceptibility, NGR, and bulk density measurements (Figure F20). These parameters are inversely correlated with the sediment color $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ parameter and appear to relate to diatom content, with a general increase downhole over tens of meters, together with variabilit y caused by interbedded lithologies. Taken together, these results suggest that sedimentary deposition is governed by variations in biogenic and terrigenous inputs. Apparent cyclicity is observed i n these parameters. Overall, these parameters suggest a higher terrigenous content in lithostratigraphic Subunit IA, decreasing terrigenous  content  and  increasing  biogenic  content  throughou t Subunits IB and IC, and maximum biogenic content in Unit II, which is predominantly diatom ooze. Lithostratigraphic Unit II I also has higher terrigenous content corresponding to interbedde d diatom-rich mud. Downhole formation temperature measurement s with the APCT-3 indicate a geothermal gradient of $58^{\circ}\mathrm{C/km},$ , whic h when combined with thermal conductivity measured on sedimen t cores from Site U1524 indicates a heat flow of $53.7\;\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ .  

Headspace gas concentrations of methane and ethane are clos e to or below the detection limit in the uppermost ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A a t Site U1524 but increase to higher concentrations at greater depth s (to 42,000 ppmv of methane at $180\,\mathrm{\m\,\,CSF{-}A}_{\!}$ ). Interstitial wate r sampling was conducted at low resolution ( $\left[\sim\right]$ sample per core i n the upper $100\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ and approximately every third core downhole from that depth, depending on core recovery) in Holes U1524 A and U1524C. A high-resolution interstitial water profile was als o obtained for the upper $7.56~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1524B. Low- an d high-resolution interstitial water profiles show clear manganese an d sulfate reduction in the suboxic to anoxic transition zone in the upper ${\sim}90\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Figure F20). A rapid increase in silicon and manganese concentration in the upper $2\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A probably reflect s shallow diagenesis of silica. Elevated barium concentration deepe r than ${\sim}90\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A may indicate barite dissolution in an environment where interstitial water is undersaturated with respect to barium. Bulk sediment TOC and $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ contents are generally lo w throughout the site but reveal distinct variability in lithostratigraphic Unit I. Higher percentages of carbonate content were observed in Subunits IB and IC and in a carbonate-cemente d mudstone in Unit III. TN content in the bulk sediments is very low, and the TOC/TN ratio displays similar trends to TOC.  

# Site U1525  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1525 (proposed Site RSCR-03A) is located on the continental slope at $75^{\circ}0.06^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $173^{\circ}55.20^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at $1776\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth on th e southeastern levee of the Hillary Canyon in a depositional settin g similar to that of Site U1524 ${\sim}87~\mathrm{km}$ northeast) (Figure F21). Sit e U1525 is closer to the continental shelf edge, which lies ${\sim}60~\mathrm{km}$ south of the site, and the mouths of the Pennell Basin and the Glomar Challenger Basin. The levee shows asymmetric flanks: a stee p northeastern erosional flank with a relief of ${\sim}500\;\mathrm{m}$ and a less stee p southwestern flank with a relief of only $_{30\textrm{m}}$ . The northwest flan k sharply truncates parallel high-amplitude reflectors outcropping a t the seafloor, and chaotic seismic facies suggest that slope failure features affect the mid- to lower units of the seismic-reflection profil e (Figure F22).  

The Hillary Canyon is one of the largest conduits for newl y formed RSBW, which is focused in this channel by cascading dens e water formed on the Ross Sea continental shelf passing down th e continental rise (Bergamasco et al., 2002). The site also lies beneat h the modern-day westward-flowing ASC (Figure F5), which i s thought to be stronger here than at the deeper water Site U152 4 (Whitworth et al. 1995; Orsi and Wiederwohl, 2009). Seismic-reflection profiles indicate that the targeted sediments at Site U152 5 are dominated by channel-overspill and drift deposits characterize d by stratified parallel seismic reflectors with high to medium amplitude (Figure F22; see also Figure F22 in the Site U1525 chapte r [McKay et al., 2019d]). These strata in the upper ${\sim}50\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A o f the site are likely glacial debris flows interlayered with interglacia l hemipelagic units of Pleistocene age that formed a prograding shelfmargin trough-mouth fan at the mouth of the Glomar Challenge r

Basin since the late Miocene (RSU3). The objective of Site U152 5 was to obtain a pre- and post-RSU3 record to provide a high-resolution chronology of an ice distal record of glacial and interglacial cycles.  

The continental slope location of Site U1525 should allow for  a more complete assessment of oceanic forcing of (and response to ) AIS variability. The deposition record from Site U1525 was expected to be primarily influenced by RSBW flowing down the Hillary  Canyon,  but  this  signal  is  modified  by  an  along-slop e component associated with the westward-flowing ASC. Consequently, this site will enable assessment of ocean forcing for ic e sheet variability and drivers of bottom water production (Objectiv e 2). The direct record of RSBW flow down Hillary Canyon obtaine d at Site U1525 could potentially be extrapolated to high-fidelity paleoceanographic records farther afield in the abyssal Pacific Ocean t o better constrain the Antarctic influences on the global oceanic dee p circulation. The Hillary Canyon is also a main route for glacial sediments being eroded and transported by ice streams from the innermost continental shelf. Provenance studies of the terrigenou s sediment may allow identification of changing ice sheet drainag e pathways through the Neogene and Quaternary.  

IRD could be sourced by icebergs from the Ross Sea, as well a s those transported from the east by the ASC, providing a proxy fo r dynamic ice discharge from the Pacific Ocean coastline sector of th e WAIS. Pelagic deposits are from periods of high productivity or  a lull in turbidity current–overspill deposition and will provide highresolution proxy records of surface water properties, including se a ice cover, SST, stratification, salinity, productivity, and warmer water incursions during Pleistocene superinterglacials. These prox y records will enable assessment of the magnitude of polar amplification during past warm climates (Objective 2) and the role of oceani c forcing of ice sheet fluctuations during those times (Objective 3). I n addition, continuous deposition was anticipated through much o f the late Neogene and Quaternary at this site, which would allow assessment of the orbital response of the WAIS and adjacent oceanic/biological systems over a range of past climatic condition s

# Operations  

After a $50\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1524 averaging $8.9\,\mathrm{kt}$ , the vessel arrived at Site U1525 at $0200\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{UTC}+13\,\mathrm{h})$ on 7 February 2018. This alternate site was added to the schedule when we were force d to temporarily leave Site U1524 because of encroaching sea ice. Th e operational plan for Site U1525 consisted of APC/XCB coring in  a single hole until ice moved away from Site U1524. Hole U1525A wa s cored to a total depth of $213.2\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF using a combination of APC, HLAPC, and XCB coring (Table T2). The XCB system was deployed in the upper part of the hole $(43.0{-}55.7\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{DSF})$ ) to core pas t an indurated interval. We then switched back to piston coring an d continued to core using both the APC and HLAPC systems to 131. 2 m DSF. We then continued coring with the XCB system to $213.2~\mathrm{m}$ DSF and terminated the hole at that depth after receiving confirmation that the sea ice was expected to clear from Site U1524 by th e next day. The rig floor was secured for transit at $0535\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 February to return to Site U1524. A total of $51.25\,\mathrm{h}$ (2.1 days) was spent i n Hole U1525A.  

We collected 33 cores at Site U1525. The APC system was deployed 8 times, collecting $63.23\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(103\%)$ ). The HLAPC system was deployed 14 times, recovering $52.64\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(92\%)$ . Th e XCB system was used 11 times and collected $42.83\mathrm{~m~}(45\%)$ .  

# Principal results  

Site U1525 cored a single hole to $213.2~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The $158.70\;\mathrm{m}$ o f recovered Pleistocene sediment is divided into three lithostratigraphic units (I–III). Unit II is divided into Subunits IIA and II B (Figure F23). A few intervals (typically $<\!15\;\mathrm{m}$ in length) are characterized by poor recovery, which compromises our ability to identif y lithologic variations. The major facies at Site U1525 are massive t o stratified diamict, sand, mud, diatom-bearing mud, and diatom-ric h mud to diatom ooze. The assemblage of facies reflects an interpla y between distal downslope, along-slope (e.g., winnowing), hemipelagic, and pelagic processes in a relatively ice distal glaciomarin e setting. Both thin laminations (millimeter to centimeter scale) an d thick beds (meter scale) are recognized in all units and may b e linked to glacial dynamics and ocean circulation variations durin g the Pleistocene.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I consists of ${\sim}51\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of unconsolidate d massive bioturbated gray diatom-bearing sandy mud with disperse d clasts interbedded on a meter scale with gray to light yellowis h brown clast-poor to clast-rich muddy diamict. Unit I bedding contacts are sharp to gradational. The muddy diamict is overcompacte d in some intervals and contains randomly distributed clasts of igneous and metamorphic composition. The base of Unit I is in an interval of poor recovery; however, it is defined by a sharp contac t between the overlying diamict and diatom-rich mud. Unit II consists of ${\sim}68\mathrm{~m~}$ of massive to laminated greenish gray diatom-bearing/rich mud interbedded at the decimeter to meter scale wit h diatom-bearing/rich sandy mud. Unit II is divided into two subunit s based on diatom abundance and the structure and texture of laminations. Subunit IIA contains well-defined millimeter-scale fin e sand, silt, and biosiliceous laminations with sharp lower boundarie s and internal normal grading. Clasts, soft-sediment deformation features, and microfaulting are observed in the laminated sequences.

Figure F23. Site U1525 summary. Preliminary environmental interpretation is based on microfossils.  

Subunit IIA also contains intervals of bioturbated foraminifer-bearing sand with sharp upper and lower contacts in the massive diatom-bearing/rich mud beds. The boundary between Subunits II A and IIB is distinguished by the onset of very thinly laminated diatom-rich mud with better preservation and higher percentages o f intact diatom frustules. Subunit IIB contains fine-grained sand an d silt laminae in coarser grained diatom-rich sandy mud beds. Clasts, pyrite staining, and sand pods, lenses, and stringers are observe d throughout the subunit. The base of Unit II is defined by a shar p contact between the laminated diatom-rich mud of Unit II and th e underlying diatom-rich sand and diamict. Unit III consists of ${\sim}90\;\mathrm{m}$ of massive to laminated greenish gray muddy diatom ooze to diatom-rich mud with dispersed to common clasts interbedded wit h massive bioturbated greenish gray diatom-rich sand and diamict. Clasts, pyrite staining, and coarse sand pods/lenses and stringer s occur throughout.  

Core catcher samples from Site U1525 were analyzed for siliceous (diatoms, radiolarians, silicoflagellates, and ebridians), calcareous (foraminifers and nannofossils), and organic (dinocysts an d other aquatic palynomorphs, pollen, and spores) microfossils. Samples in the upper ${\sim}107\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ of the interval are mostly devoid o f microfossils, contain only trace numbers, or include a “residual” assemblage of resistant forms that have likely been engaged in multiple phases of transport and reworking by ice and/or botto m currents (Figure F23). Diatom taxa found in this interval wer e eroded and transported from discrete source beds of Miocene t o early Pliocene age. One age-diagnostic radiolarian event found i n this interval indicates an age older than $0.65\ \mathrm{Ma}$ at ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Several discrete intervals of foraminifer-bearing/rich sand are present near the base of this interval, and a sparse, moderately well-preserved Neogene assemblage of calcareous nannofossils was found i n one of these beds.  

Deeper than ${\sim}107\,\mathrm{~m~}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ , siliceous microfossils are mor e abundant and well preserved, and several age diagnostic radiolarians and diatoms were encountered (Figure F23). Although  a small background presence of reworked diatoms continues in thi s interval, the sequence can confidently be assigned an early Pleistocene age. Planktonic and benthic foraminifers are also most abundant and diverse in this lower Pleistocene section, and the presenc e of the temperate planktonic species Globoconella inflata at ${\sim}89\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A and Globigerina bulloides and Globigerina falconensis a t ${\sim}125\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A indicates the presence of warmer-than-present water. Dinocysts are sparse in this interval, and only one sample fro m the lower Pleistocene ( ${\sim}155\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) contains abundant specimens that comprise species so far only known from upper Quaternary sediments of the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, sout h of the Polar Front.  

We developed an age model for Site U1525 using a combinatio n of radiolarian and diatom biostratigraphic events. A hiatus is detected by biostratigraphic (diatom) marker species between $\mathord{\sim}111$ and $117\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ that constrains the age of sediments deeper tha n this interval to older than $2.35\,\mathrm{~Ma~}$ and shallower sediments t o younger than $1.9\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . The lowermost ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ of the Site U1525 sequence represents an expanded lower Pleistocene section (Figur e F23) with a sustained high sediment accumulation rate of ${>}60$ $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ . Above the disconformity, significant amounts of reworke d microfossils in the upper ${\sim}107\,\mathrm{~m~}$ preclude definitive age assignment for the interval.  

Paleomagnetic investigations were primarily focused on determining the ChRM to construct a magnetostratigraphy. The initia l NRM was measured at $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals on most archive-half core sections, followed by NRM measurements after AF demagnetization o f 10 and $20~\mathrm{mT}$ to remove a potential drilling overprint. NRM intensity of cores shallower than ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A decreases as much as a n order of magnitude after $10~\mathrm{mT}$ , whereas NRM intensity of core s deeper than ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A decreases by $30\%{-}50\%$ after demagnetization. Initial NRM inclination is generally steep and downward directed, but AF demagnetization removes this overprint to revea l clusters of steep upward- and downward-directed inclinations. W e interpret these clusters to be normal and reversed polarity zones, respectively. To test the fidelity of these polarity zones, we also subjected a selected group of oriented discrete samples to a 20-step demagnetization protocol and used PCA to determine the ChR M direction. The discrete and archive-half measurements agree well, so we can correlate the normal and reversed polarity zones to th e GPTS aided by the independent biostratigraphic age control. W e identify the Jaramillo (0.988–1.072 Ma) and Cobb Mountai n (1.173–1.185 Ma) Subchrons and the Olduvai Chron (1.778–1.94 5 Ma). We correlate a zone of reversed polarity below the hiatus t o Subchron C2r.2r (2.148–2.581 Ma) based on diatom constraints.  

Physical property measurements were conducted on all core s from Hole U1525A. In general, the whole-round core GRA bul k density, magnetic susceptibility, and $P$ -wave velocity measurement s are in good agreement with discrete MAD samples and point measurements of magnetic susceptibility and $P$ -wave velocity on th e section halves over the upper $131\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , which were primarily core d with the APC and HLAPC systems (Figure F23). The switch to XC B coring deeper than $131\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A had an effect on whole-roun d measurements, especially magnetic susceptibility, NGR, and GR A bulk density, because the diameter of XCB cores does not completely fill the core liner. The $P_{\|}$ -wave logger was turned off deepe r than $131\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ .  

In lithostratigraphic Unit I, magnetic susceptibility, NGR, bul k density, $P$ -wave velocity, and shear strength increase downhole an d porosity decreases (Figure F23). These changes reflect both compaction and slight changes in lithology in the diatom-bearing sand y mud interbedded with clast-poor/rich muddy diamict. Peaks i n magnetic susceptibility, NGR, bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, an d shear strength and a decrease in porosity occur in a short interval i n Unit I $({\sim}15{-}18\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ ), reflecting increased clasts, clay, and compaction in this diamict unit that are interpreted to be a debris flow. In Unit II, decimeter-scale cyclicity is visible in magnetic susceptibility and NGR and is likely related to downhole changes in lithology. Shear strength in Unit II also demonstrates downhole cyclicit y that may be related to lithologic changes or compaction. Generall y lower magnetic susceptibility, NGR, density, and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity i n Unit III reflect increased diatom content.  

Headspace gas methane and ethane concentrations are low i n the upper $124~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and increase to 6640 and 7 ppmv, respectively, at 194 m CSF-A at Site U1525. Interstitial water analyses o f the mudline and 12 whole-round samples indicate biogeochemica l zonation, with sulfate reduction in the uppermost ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Downhole variations in silicon concentration broadly correspon d with lithologic changes (Figure F23), whereas calcium concentration decreases from seawater-like values in the uppermost $32\textrm{m}$ CSF-A to a minimum value around the boundary between lithostratigraphic Subunit IIB and Unit III. Lithium concentration mor e than doubles along a linear trend deeper than ${\sim}60\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. TO C and carbonate contents are low $(-0.6\%$ and $4.5\%,$ respectively ) throughout the site. The highest and most variable carbonate content and TOC/TN ratio occur in the uppermost $34\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A i n lithostratigraphic Unit I.  

# Expedition synthesis and preliminary scientific assessment  

Operational considerations relating to the science objectives  

The overarching goal of Expedition 374 was to drill a transec t from the outer Ross Sea continental shelf to the continental ris e (Figure F24) to identify oceanic forcings and feedbacks relating t o past ice sheet variability from the Neogene to Quaternary. Unfortunately, this ambition was not fully realized because a mechanical failure with the vessel resulted in termination of all drilling operations and a loss of 16 on-site operational days (from a total of 41). The loss of $39\%$ of our operational time restricted our ability t o achieve all objectives as originally envisioned. Although aspects o f all objectives can be met, this unforeseen change in the operation s plan severely compromised the plan to recover continuous record s from the deep-water sites covering contemporaneous periods collected on the continental shelf. We also note that drilling operation s in the Antarctic are inherently more challenging than other region s because of weather, ice, and lithologic considerations that have traditionally resulted in poor recovery on the Antarctic continental shelf. Expedition 374 was highly successful in this context. The discussion below provides a synthesis of these successes and highlight s the importance of a flexible operations plan and large numbers o f alternate sites to adapt to these Antarctic-specific considerations. We also document some of the challenges that remain despite ou r very targeted approach to drilling in this environment.  

In general, the operations plan successfully mitigated most risk s associated with weather, ice, and lithology. Recovery rates using th e RCB system at the continental shelf sites were higher than expected, particularly in the lithified Miocene strata at Site U1521 ( $63\%$ total recovery), which had the highest recovery rate for ship-based drilling on the Antarctic continental shelf. Total recovery at outer continental shelf Site U1522 was $40\%$ , but coring proved more difficult i n the unlithified Plio–Pleistocene sediments shallower than $400\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A $21\%$ recovery). However, recovery was far more successful in the upper Miocene lithified diamictite intervals deeper tha n $400\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ $64\%$ recovery), which were the primary targets of thi s site. Our original operations plan included coring at proposed Sit e EBOCS-04B after completing operations at Site U1522. Seismi c correlations indicated that the targeted section at proposed Site EBOCS-04B is almost identical to the unlithified Plio–Pleistocen e lithologies we encountered in the upper $400\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A at Site U1522. Given our experience of poor recovery in these lithologies at Sit e U1522, we had low confidence in our ability to obtain a recover y rate at proposed Site EBOCS-04B that was suitable to meet our objectives. Consequently, we modified the operations plan to core  a different depositional setting at Site U1523, which targeted a Mio

The seismic data have different resolutions and penetration depths because they were collected by several nations with different parameters and targets. Line BGR80-007 (24–air gun array; 23.4 5 L) was collected by Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe (Germany) in 1980, Line ATC-208 (bolt-type air gun; 35.58 L) was collected by th e Institut Français du Pétrole (France) in 1982, and Lines IT94-127A $(2\times20\cdot$ –air gun array; 74.8 L) and IT17RS-303B (air gun; 3.44 L) were collected by Istitut o Nazionale di Oceanografia e Geofisica Sperimentale (Italy) under Programma Nazionale delle Ricerche in Antartide in 1994 and 2017, respectively.

cene to Pleistocene sediment drift on the outermost continenta l shelf. This depositional setting had never been sampled by dee p drilling in the Antarctic, although shallow piston and gravity core s indicated that the upper sediment at the site consists of unconsolidated diatom-bearing/rich mud/sandy mud with clasts. This sit e provided its own challenges, with soft diatom-rich muddy lithologies interbedded with unconsolidated gravels and indurate d strata. Consequently, we adopted a novel approach of targeted halflength piston coring, whereby the gravel-rich and indurated lithologies that were impossible to recover with any type of corin g method were identified in the first two holes (U1523A an d U1523B). After examination of drilling parameters (e.g., penetratio n rate and weight on bit) and core catcher material and assessment o f downhole logs from Hole U1523D, a final hole (U1523E) was advanced without coring through these difficult lithologies, an d HLAPC cores were successfully collected in the underlying softe r lithologies. This resulted in high recovery $(73\%)$ of the targete d ${\sim}95\;\mathrm{m}$ thick Plio–Pleistocene interval. XCB coring in Miocen e strata below this depth was less successful, but sporadic intervals o f high recovery will provide an important archive of this rarely sampled time period in Antarctica. An attempt was made to RCB cor e at Site U1523. As anticipated for these lithologies, recovery was ver y poor $\left(0.5\%\right)$ , and this hole was primarily intended to serve as  a “clean” hole for downhole logging to complete the missing stratigraphy of the APC/HLAPC- and XCB-cored intervals. Thus, despite the extremely poor recovery in Hole U1523D, this RCB hol e proved highly valuable because hole conditions were suitable to obtain downhole logs.  

Recovery rates with the APC system were expected to be ver y high on the continental rise sites, and this proved to be the case. Coring at Site U1524 obtained $100\%$ recovery in the $270\textrm{m}$ thic k APC/HLAPC-cored interval. Recovery was poor in the XCB-core d interval, and many XCB cores returned with shattered core liner s (14 out of 22; $64\%$ ). We speculated that this unexpected result wa s due to the very cold surface sea water $\left(-1.5^{\circ}\right.$ to $-2^{\circ}C)$ used as drillin g fluid. This issue should be investigated for future expeditions tha t drill in extreme cold-water regions. At Site U1524, XCB coring wa s terminated because of poor recovery. This decision coincided wit h a weather event that pushed sea ice toward the site. We mitigate d for sea ice risk in our plan by identifying several alternate sites. Th e shipboard ice observer indicated that the sea ice would pass completely over Site U1524 in ${\sim}3$ days. Considering the short time window for operations elsewhere before we could return to Site U152 4 to complete our primary objectives, we collected a single APC cor e in Hole U1524B for high-resolution microbiological and interstitial water sampling. We then temporarily abandoned Site U1524 an d decided to piston core nearby $(47\;\mathrm{\nmi})$ continental slope Sit e U1525. This site required minimal transit time and provided a complementary record that overlaps the upper part of Site U1524 but i n a more proximal setting to the continental shelf, thus providing  a hybrid record of the depositional processes observed at Sites U152 3 and U1524 (e.g., ASC vigor and AABW formation, respectively). After being informed that the sea ice would drift off Site U1524 by th e next day, we terminated coring at $213.2\textrm{m}$ DSF because the XC B coring at Site U1525 also proved problematic (multiple shattere d core liners). We returned to Site U1524 to core with the RCB syste m to a target depth of $1000~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, but the site was terminated a t 442 m DSF because of the mechanical failure and termination of all drilling operations. Consequently, Site U1524 was terminated before our stratigraphic target could fully be met, and we were unabl e to obtain the deeper sediment that was a primary objective of th e site. This deeper sediment would have contained a middle Miocen e continental rise record of paleoenvironments from the same tim e period as the high-quality continental shelf record from Site U1521. Termination of operations also precluded us from coring a final hol e to APC refusal to recover a complete stratigraphy in the upper par t of the sequence. Despite these setbacks, many aspects of the continental shelf-to-rise transect can be achieved for the Plio–Pleistocene interval through comparison with records from Sites U1522– U1525 and the ANDRILL program.  

The mechanical failure also meant we could not recover a record from proposed Site RSCR-19A, which was a late-addition alternate site that was upgraded to a primary site during the earl y phase of the expedition because we recognized it was the most suitable site at which to obtain a high-fidelity, continuous record of pelagic/hemipelagic sedimentation in the Ross Sea. Despite th e unforeseen mechanical issue compromising much of the scienc e plan, the material recovered during Expedition 374 will still provid e unprecedented insights into the coupled nature of past marinebased ice sheets in West Antarctica and the adjacent water masse s directly offshore. Our operational plan and risk mitigation strateg y were successful, as was recovery of upper Miocene and older strat a on the Ross Sea continental shelf using rotary coring methods. AP C coring methods also demonstrated that high-quality, continuou s drill core records can be obtained from the Antarctic continenta l slope and rise.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Our drilling plan identified a series of sites where a source-tosink sedimentary system could be mapped through the extensiv e network of Ross Sea seismic surveys. It targeted a continental shelfto-rise transect approach (Figure F24) that would allow for a detailed assessment of oceanic–ice sheet interactions back to at leas t the late early Miocene (Figure F3). Critically, we located the dril l sites on the outer Ross Sea continental shelf because models indicate that this sector of the Antarctic is the most sensitive to oceani c heat flux during deglacial events and, conversely, is one of the las t areas of the continental shelf to become glaciated during past glacia l advance events (Figure F4). Thus, the records from the sites provid e an end-member scenario for identifying the climatic thresholds required to achieve a fully glaciated state in Antarctica, as well a s identifying oceanic triggers for glacial retreat. Sites U1521 an d U1522 were drilled on the outer Ross Sea continental shelf (Figur e F2) and explicitly designed to directly identify the timing of pas t grounding and retreat events of marine-based ice sheets in the Ros s Sea. Site U1521 targeted a middle Miocene record to identify th e processes that lead to the expansion of large ice streams emanatin g from the EAIS across the western Ross Sea continental shelf and t o recover a semicontinuous record of the MCO in a relatively iceproximal location.  

We cored a $650\;\mathrm{m}$ thick sequence of interbedded diamictite an d diatom-rich mudstone strata at Site U1521 (Figure F11, F25), wit h the aim of sampling above and below RSU4. The depositional reconstructions obtained from these lithologies will provide unprecedented insight into environmental change at the Antarctic margi n during the middle Miocene. Site U1522 targeted a Pleistocene t o upper Miocene sequence from the outer shelf (Figure F14, F25 ) with the primary objective to penetrate and date RSU3, which is interpreted to represent the first major continental shelf–wide expansion and coalescing of marine-based ice streams from both East an d West Antarctica. Recovery at Site U1522 was in line with expectations, and the primary objective of dating RSU3 was achieved. Th e lithology at Site U1522 is dominated by diamictite, and lithologi c variations are subtler than those at Site U1521. Thin diatom-ric h mudstone and diatomite beds were recovered in some intervals, an d they will provide snapshot records of a deglaciated outer shelf environment in the late Miocene. Finer grained (diatomite to diatomrich mud) and unconsolidated diamict and gravel-rich beds indicated by the FMS log were likely present but were possibly washe d away in the coring process at Sites U1521 and U1522. However, downhole logging operations were successful at both sites and allo w for a fuller assessment of lithologic cyclicity. Outer continental shel f Site U1523 is a sediment drift that yielded a sequence of diato m ooze, foraminifer-rich sand, gravel, and diamict and enables the reconstruction of a record of changing surface and intermediate wate r properties (e.g., SST, salinity, and nutrient availability) and productivity at this location near the continental shelf break. Furthermore, the location of Site U1523 beneath the westward flowing ASC (Figure F5) will allow reconstruction of the changing vigor of this current through time. This reconstruction will enable testing of th e hypothesis that changes in ASC vigor regulate heat flux onto th e continental shelf, thus making the ASC a key control on ice shee t mass balance.  

At Site U1524, we cored a sedimentary sequence on the continental rise on the levee of the Hillary Canyon (Figure F24), one o f the largest conduits of AABW delivery from the Antarctic continental shelf into the abyssal ocean. We were mostly successful i n achieving our objectives at this site by recovering a high-qualit y Plio–Pleistocene record (Figure F20, F25) of turbidite activity relating to transport of cascading water masses (e.g., AABW) down th e Hillary Canyon. This record can provide a reconstruction of thi s critical component of the global oceanic overturning circulation. Recovered overspill turbidite deposits are interbedded with period s of pelagic deposition and will enable proxy reconstructions of surface and bottom water properties. However, Site U1524 was intended to provide a record that extends to the middle Miocene t o overlap with the continental record obtained at Site U1521. This objective was not achieved as originally planned because of the mechanical failure that ended operations. In principle, the Plio– Pleistocene AABW record collected at Site U1524 can be correlate d to the ice sheet variability record at Site U1522, but poor recovery i n the Plio–Pleistocene interval of Site U1522 will make such correlations challenging. However, previous drilling at ANDRILL Sit e AND-1B recovered an exceptional record of inner continental shel f ice sheet variance through this time interval (Naish et al., 2009). Correlation to that site will allow for an unprecedented link between continental shelf processes and changing AABW flux into th e deep ocean through this time period. In addition, links to changin g surface water properties and ASC vigor can be made through correlations to Site U1523.  

At Site U1525, we also cored a continental slope levee syste m near the flank of the Hillary Canyon (Figure F22), but the upper ${\sim}50$ m of the system was buried by the margin of a large trough-mout h fan deposit west of the site. The site is closer to the continental shel f break and consequently is more influenced by the ASC than Sit e U1524. The lithofacies suggest an increased influence of tractio n currents relating to this current together with a higher IRD conten t (Figure F23). Thus, this site may provide an important and uniqu e hybrid record of AABW formation, ASC current vigor, and iceber g discharge relating to dynamic ice sheet processes on the continental shelf and/or along the Pacific margin of the WAIS. The Site U152 5 core record overlaps in time with the records obtained at Site s U1523 and U1524 (Figure F25) and ANDRILL Site AND-1B (Nais h et al., 2001; McKay et al., 2009).

# Science objectives achieved during Expedition 374  

The discussion above provides an overview of the difficulties in achieving all of the expedition objectives caused by the mechanica l failure of the vessel and early return to port. Critically, we lost th e ability to develop stratigraphic ties between the continental shel f and the deep ocean during the Miocene time period. This was a fundamental component of our science plan, which sought a continental shelf-to-rise transect to understand ocean–ice sheet interaction s during the warmer-than-present Neogene, with a particular focu s on the MCO $({\sim}17{-}14.5\;\mathrm{Ma})$ , mid-Pliocene $({\sim}4{-}3\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , and Pleistocene superinterglacials. The successes relating to the science objectives, noting this caveat and that key aspects of most objectives wer e not achieved as originally intended, are discussed below.  

# Evaluate the contribution of West Antarctica to farfield ice volume and sea level estimates  

RSU4 and RSU3 were penetrated at Sites U1521 and U1522, respectively, during Expedition 374 (Figure F6), and their ages will b e refined during postcruise analysis. The ages of these unconformitie s were previously poorly constrained, and improved estimates o f these ages (Figure F6) will constrain the timing of the first large expansion of the marine-based ice sheets sourced from the EAIS int o the western and central Ross Sea (RSU4) and the first marine-base d WAIS advances to the continental shelf edge (RSU3). Models indicate that grounded ice sheets on the outermost continental shelf i n the Ross Sea imply a maximum ice sheet extent on the Antarcti c continent as a whole (Pollard and DeConto 2009; Golledge et a l 2013). Therefore, integration with the ice sheet retreat events fro m the ANDRILL records (Sites AND-1B and AND-2A) will allow fo r assessment of the WAIS contribution to Neogene sea level estimates. Lithofacies analyses at continental shelf Sites U1521 an d U1522 combined with seismic stratigraphic correlations will identify deposition during periods of grounded-ice, glaciomarine, an d open-marine conditions. Sediment provenance studies at Site s U1521 and U1522 will enable understanding of the changes in th e source region of sediments and identify whether glacial transpor t and deposition is sourced from local ice caps or large-scale ice shee t expansion (e.g., East versus West Antarctic source).  

# Reconstruct ice-proximal atmospheric and oceanic temperatures to identify past polar amplification and assess its forcings/feedbacks  

All of the records obtained during Expedition 374 are relevan t to addressing this objective, and most sites contain lithofacies suitable for proxy-based reconstruction of past climatic and oceanographic conditions at the Antarctic margin during warmer-thanpresent climates. Diatom-rich mud and diatom ooze (diatomite) ar e present in discrete intervals at all sites (Figure F25), and initia l microfossil analyses demonstrate the possibility for high-resolutio n diatom, radiolarian, and palynological studies (Figures F26, F27) t o reconstruct past variations in SSTs, surface water stratification (related to meltwater input and sea ice formation), and biological productivity. Calcareous foraminifers occur sporadically but are mor e abundant in some Pliocene and Pleistocene interglacial sequences a t Sites U1523 and U1525 (Figures F17, F23). Biogenic carbonate, including foraminifers, is more common in middle Miocene sequences and in a diatom-rich mud interval at Site U1521 (Figur e F11). The latter contains abundant articulated bivalves that provid e opportunities for stable isotope, trace element, and clumped isotope analyses. The application of additional proxies for past temperature  reconstructions,  including  biomarker  proxies  (e.g., TEX86), will be investigated at all sites. Pollen-based reconstructions and terrestrial biomarker proxies (e.g., MBT/CBT) will allo w us to determine the extent of atmospheric polar amplificatio n during these time periods and to track the resulting terrestrial runoff during the warmer climates of the Pliocene and Miocene.  

# Assess the role of oceanic forcing on WAIS stability/instability  

ANDRILL Sites AND-1B and AND-2A provided compelling evidence of a smaller-than-present WAIS during the MCO, the war m Pliocene, and the early Pleistocene climates, which was likely a consequence of wind-driven upwelling of warm water onto the continental shelf (Naish et al., 2009; Pollard and DeConto, 2009; Levy e t al., 2016). Expedition 374 aimed to test this hypothesis by obtainin g new records of ice sheet extent from continental shelf Sites U152 1 and U1522 to complement and expand on the ANDRILL record an d provide a record of changing ocean current vigor and water masse s near the continental shelf break (Site U1523), continental slope (Sit e U1525), and continental rise (Site U1524). At the sites most proximal to the continental shelf break (Sites U1523 and U1525), paleocurrent strength associated with changes in the westwardflowing ASC will be reconstructed by examining the sedimentological (e.g., facies analysis and grain size) characteristics and magneti c fabrics.  

Micropaleontological, geochemical, and sedimentological studies from Expedition 374 cores will provide reconstructions o f changing regional surface conditions that are relevant to water mas s exchange between the Southern Ocean and the Ross Sea continental shelf/WAIS (e.g., sea ice, surface stratification, SSTs, polyny a mixing, glacial meltwater discharge, nutrient uptake, and supercooling of dense water by ice shelves). Downslope currents resultin g from the transfer of RSBW into the abyssal ocean (e.g., AABW formation) can also be assessed (and distinguished from ASC flow) b y integrated bio- and lithofacies analyses, geochemistry, and micropaleontology at Sites U1523–U1525. Foraminifer-bearing/rich bed s occur in several intervals at both Sites U1523 and U1525 and hol d promise for stable isotope and trace element analysis to reconstruc t past water mass and temperature variations at these sites.  

# Identify the sensitivity of WAIS to Earth’s orbital configuration under a variety of climate boundary conditions  

Fundamental questions remain about the orbital pacing of AI S variability. In particular, records obtained during Expedition 37 4 should shed light on whether orbitally paced AIS variations responded to local insolation forcing or were regulated by interhemispheric teleconnections associated with low-latitude or high– northern  latitude  drivers.  Sedimentological  analyses  (complemented by downhole logs) will enable development of a direct record of orbital-scale ice sheet advances and retreats across th e continental shelf at Sites U1521 and U1522. The turbidite levee deposits at continental rise and slope Sites U1524 and U1525 are believed to be the consequence of water masses cascading down th e Hillary Canyon (Figure F5). As such, these deposits are anticipate d to provide a record of changes in AABW production and delivery o f sediment to the continental shelf by ice sheet advances throug h time. These records can then be directly related to changing ic e sheet and sea ice extent on the Ross Sea continental shelf and tied t o far-field sea-level, temperature, and water mass records. Superimposed on this AABW signal will be an orbital-scale record of IR D and ASC vigor that will link changes in AABW production and export to shifting ice dynamics along the Pacific Ocean margin of th e WAIS.  

# Reconstruct eastern Ross Sea bathymetry to examine relationships between seafloor geometry, ice sheet stability/instability, and global climate  

The modern-day bathymetry of the Ross Sea is characterized b y an overdeepened continental shelf that makes the WAIS vulnerabl e to marine ice sheet instability. With this bathymetric configuration, once a climatic warming triggers an ice sheet retreat event, th e grounding line retreats into increasingly deeper water, resulting i n

increased flux of ice discharging into the ocean (and melting ) (Weertman, 1974; Thomas and Bentley, 1978, Colleoni et al., 2018b). This increased flux leads to a runaway retreat process, eve n if there is no further climate forcing. Consequently, the transitio n from a terrestrial- or shallow marine–based West Antarctica with  a seaward-dipping shallow continental shelf to that of the moder n overdeepened (i.e., landward dipping) continental shelf has a firstorder control on the sensitivity of the AIS to external climate an d oceanic boundary conditions (Wilson et al., 2013; Gasson et al., 2016, Colleoni et al., 2018a; 2018b). The timing of Ross Sea shel f overdeepening is poorly constrained, and the location of Expeditio n  

374 sites was selected to help improve the age constraints on the ke y seismic unconformities relating to this event. The sites should als o provide important reconstructions of the depositional environmen t (e.g., water depth) relevant to the paleobathymetry at the time o f formation of RSU4, RSU3, and RSU2 (Figure F6) at Sites U1521 an d U1522. These three unconformities document fundamental shift s in the eastern Ross Sea that relate to erosion by advancing ic e streams across a relatively shallow continental shelf from East Antarctica (RSU4), West Antarctica (RSU3), and the transition towar d an overdeepened continental shelf by RSU2 time. All three of thes e

unconformities were penetrated on the continental shelf during Expedition 374, which greatly reduces the uncertainty in their ages.  

# Additional expedition contributions  

Numerous campaigns to drill the Antarctic margin have bee n conducted over the past five decades. Despite these efforts, th e margin still remains understudied with respect to the deep biosphere and hydrological system. To address this shortcoming, dedicated mudline APC cores were collected at Sites U1523 and U152 4 for high-resolution microbiological and interstitial water sampling. These cores will enable the first characterization of the vertical distribution of microbial flora in the deep biosphere of the Ross Sea.  

Metagenomics analyses of high-resolution subsamples will provid e further information on the biodiversity of bacteria, methanogens, and fungi in an understudied polar area. Additionally, metabolis m and activities of deep-biosphere communities will be characterize d using biogeochemical and molecular studies. The combination o f interstitial water chemistry and sediment samples can elucidate biogeochemical cycling of elements and isotopes. Being able to conduct such studies at high resolution in the uppermost part of th e sediment column is unprecedented for the Ross Sea shelf and ris e and will provide unique insights into microbiology, early diageneti c processes, and redox profiles.
