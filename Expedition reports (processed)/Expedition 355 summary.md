# Abstract  

The Indian (southwest) summer monsoon is one of the most intense climatic phenomena on Earth, with its long-term development possibly linked to the growth of high topography in South and Central Asia. The Indian continental margin, adjoining the Arabian Sea, offers a unique opportunity to investigate tectonic–climatic interactions and the net impact of these processes on weathering and erosion of the western Himalaya. During International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 355, two sites (U1456 and U1457) were drilled in Laxmi Basin in the eastern Arabian Sea to document the coevolution of mountain building, weathering, erosion, and climate over a range of timescales. In addition, recovering basement from the eastern Arabian Sea provides constraints on the early rifting history of the western continental margin of India with special emphasis on continental breakup between India and the Seychelles and its relationship to the plume-related volcanism of the Deccan Plateau.  

Drilling and coring operations during Expedition 355 recovered sediment from Sites U1456 and U1457 in Laxmi Basin, penetrating 1109.4 and $1108.6\mathrm{~m~}$ below seafloor (mbsf), respectively. Drilling reached sediment dated to 13.5–17.7 Ma (late early to early middle Miocene) at Site U1456, although with a large hiatus between the lowermost sediment and overlying deposits dated at ${<}10.9\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . At Site U1457, a much longer hiatus occurs near the base of the cored section, spanning from $\mathord{\sim}10.9$ to ${\sim}62\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . At both sites, hiatuses span ${\sim}8.2{-}9.2$ and ${\sim}3.6{-}5.6\ \mathrm{Ma}$ with a possible condensed section spanning ${\sim}2.0{-}2.6\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , although the total duration for each hiatus is slightly different between the two sites.  

A major submarine fan probably draining the western Himalaya and Karakoram must have been supplying sediment to the eastern Arabian Sea since at least ${\sim}17~\mathrm{Ma}$ . Sand mineral assemblages indicate that the Greater Himalayan Crystalline Sequence was fully exposed to the surface by this time. Most of the recovered sediment appears to be derived from the Indus River and includes minerals that are unique to the Indus Suture Zone, in particular glaucophane and hypersthene, most likely originating from the structural base of the Kohistan arc (i.e., within the Indus Suture Zone). Pliocene sandy intervals at Site U1456 were deposited in lower fan “sheet lobe” settings, with intervals of basin–plain turbidites separated by hemipelagic muddy sections deposited during the Miocene. Site U1457 is more distal in facies, reflecting its more marginal setting. No major active lobe appears to have affected Laxmi Basin since the late early Pleistocene $({\sim}1.2{-}1.5\,\mathrm{Ma})$ .  

We succeeded in recovering sections spanning the 8 Ma climatic transition, when monsoon intensity is believed to have changed strongly, although the nature of this change awaits postcruise analysis. We also recovered sediment from large mass transport deposits measuring ${\sim}330$ and ${\sim}190\mathrm{~m~}$ thick at Sites U1456 and U1457, respectively. These sections include an upper sequence of slumpfolded muddy and silty rocks, as well as underlying calcarenites and limestone breccias, together with smaller amounts of volcanic clasts, all of which are likely derived from the western Indian continental shelf. Identification of similar facies on the regional seismic lines in Laxmi Basin suggests that these deposits form parts of one of the world’s largest mass transport deposits.  

Coring of igneous basement was achieved at Site U1457. Recovery of massive basalt and associated volcaniclastic sediment at this site should address the key questions related to rifting and volcanism associated with formation of Laxmi Basin. Geochemical analysis indicates that these are low-K, high-Mg subalkaline tholeiitic basalts and do not represent a typical mid-ocean-ridge basalt. Other observations made at the two sites during Expedition 355 provide vital constraints on the rift history of this margin. Heat flow measurements at the two drill sites were calculated to be ${\sim}57$ and ${\sim}60$ $\mathrm{{mW}/\mathrm{{m}^{2}}}$ . Such heat flow values are compatible with those observed in average oceanic crust of 63–84 Ma age, as well as with the presence of highly extended continental crust. Postcruise analyses of the more than $\mathord{\sim}1722\;\mathrm{m}$ of core will provide further information about the nature of tectonic–climatic interactions in this global type area for such studies.  

# Introduction  

The theory of plate tectonics established that the solid Earth’s lithosphere interacts intimately with the underlying, circulating asthenosphere. However, more recently the geoscience community has started to recognize that the lithosphere also has significant interactions with the overlying atmosphere and oceans. Such interactions can influence atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns and thereby control Earth’s climate by changing the distribution of heat across the planet. Furthermore, feedback from the atmosphere to the lithosphere provides a new vision of how orogenic belts and even passive margins evolve under the stress of surface processes. Interactions between the solid Earth and the climate system can occur in at least two different ways. The opening and closure of deepocean gateways are believed to have caused large-scale climate changes by affecting heat transport between ocean basins or between polar and tropical regions (e.g., Haug and Tiedemann, 1998; Cane and Molnar, 2001; von der Heydt and Dijkstra, 2006). Alternatively, mountain building may perturb planetary-scale atmospheric circulation, influencing continental environments and oceanography of the surrounding basins as mountain barriers divert air streams and affect continental temperatures and humidity (e.g., Huber and Goldner, 2012). Furthermore, changes in continental erosion can profoundly impact Earth’s carbon and biogeochemical cycles (e.g., Berner et al., 1983). These various pathways for interaction occurred throughout the Cenozoic with the closure of the Tethys Ocean by subduction under the southern edge of Eurasia during the northward motion of Africa, Arabia, India, and a host of smaller continental fragments whose accretion caused the uplift of the Alpine-Himalayan mountain belt.  

The suggestion that mountain building in Asia has intensified monsoon strength in the Indian subcontinent is the most dramatic proposed example of lithospheric–atmospheric interactions (Prell and Kutzbach, 1992; Molnar et al., 1993; An et al., 2001; Molnar et al., 2010; Boos and Kuang, 2010). This is partly a reflection of the scale of the tectonism and the resultant mountains. Nonetheless, there is increasing recognition that other factors, such as the retreat of shallow seas in Central Asia, may have also played a role in controlling monsoon intensity (Ramstein et al., 1997). Asia is the only continent that experiences such a strong monsoon, which is partly a reflection of landmass size but is also linked to its tectonic history and anomalously high altitude across a broad region. Understanding what controls monsoon intensity is of great scientific interest and has substantive societal as well as economic importance, considering the large number of people whose livelihood depends on the monsoon and who would be affected if it varied significantly.  

Quantifying the various processes that control monsoon intensity over geologic timescales will improve the context for shorter term modeling of how future climate change may affect the densely populated environments of Asia. Specifically, we aim to answer the question of what links exist between the Indian monsoon and the building of high topography in Asia, and whether climatic feedbacks have influenced the tectonic evolution of the western Himalaya and Karakoram.  

The Arabian Sea in the northern Indian Ocean (Figure F1) preserves regional sedimentary records of rifting, tectonic subsidence, and paleoceanographic history and also provides archives of longterm erosion of the Himalaya since the start of continental collision between India and Eurasia. Although the timing is controversial (Aitchison et al., 2007; DeCelles et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014), it is thought that collision probably began in the Eocene (Garzanti et al., 1987; Rowley, 1996; Najman et al., 2010). Scientific drilling in the Arabian Sea was designed to reconstruct the evolution of erosion and weathering in the western Himalaya and Karakoram, as well as the environmental conditions that existed in the flood plains of the Indus Basin through the Cenozoic. This was done in an area where Indian monsoon evolution is already partly reconstructed (Kroon et al., 1991; Prell et al., 1992). Thus erosion, tectonism, and climate can be directly compared to one another for the first time over long time spans and at high resolution.  

In addition to being a repository of information about past climate and mountain building, the Arabian Sea also holds potentially illuminating records of continental rifting and breakup tectonics dating from the time of Gondwana fragmentation in the Cretaceous (Heine et al., 2004). Paleogeographic reconstructions based on seafloor magnetic anomalies, as well as similarities in structural/tectonic elements, suggest a conjugate relationship between the western continental margin of India and the eastern continental margin of Madagascar and the Seychelles (Storey et al., 1995; Collier et al., 2008). In-depth studies of the conjugate margins in this region offer new data to complement our knowledge from other well-studied conjugate margins, such as the Iberia-Newfoundland and Greenland-Norway pairs of the Atlantic Ocean (e.g., Whitmarsh et al., 2001; Hopper et al., 2003). The nature of the continent/ocean boundary is controversial in the Arabian Sea, especially with regard to Laxmi Ridge, an enigmatic block located offshore of the western Indian coast (Figure F1).  

The widely held view among geoscientists is that Laxmi Ridge is a continental sliver rifted away from India (Naini and Talwani, 1983); however, contrary views have also emerged that suggest it could be stretched/oceanic crust (Bhattacharya et al., 1994; Miles et al., 1998; Talwani and Reif, 1998). The proximity of this margin to the volcanic Deccan Traps makes this potentially a classic margin for investigating plume-rift interactions. However, links are presently only conjectural because the nature of the breakup, including the style of strain accommodation, and the timing of the extension in relation to the Deccan volcanic event are unconstrained and require physical sampling of the basement on the continental margin. An international workshop on scientific drilling in the Indian Ocean was organized in Goa, India, in October 2011 at which understanding the evolution of the Asian monsoon was highlighted as a crucial theme. Following this workshop, several proposals related to the evolution of the Asian monsoon were developed. International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 355 was based on drilling Proposal 793-CPP2. The primary objectives of this expedition can be summarized under two major themes, “Climate and Ocean Change” and “Earth Connections,” which are described in the IODP Science Plan (http://www.iodp.org/about-iodp/iodpscience-plan-2013-2023). Specific goals of this proposal include  

1. Testing whether the timing of the exhumation of the Greater Himalaya correlates with enhanced erosional flux and intense chemical weathering at ${\sim}23\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ;

3. Dating the age of the base of the fan to constrain the timing of India/Eurasia collision and subsequent uplift of the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau; and   
4. Deciphering the nature of the crust in Laxmi Basin (eastern Arabian Sea), which has a significant bearing on paleogeographic reconstructions along conjugate margins in the Arabian Sea and models of continental breakup and rifted volcanic margin formation.  

# Background Geological setting  

The eastern Arabian Sea presents an intriguing case for th e study of continental breakup between India and Madagascar, differing in important ways from both the classic nonvolcanic IberiaNewfoundland conjugate (Boillot et al., 1995; Whitmarsh et al., 2001) and the volcanic Norway-Greenland margin (Skogseid et al., 2000; Hopper et al., 2003). The northern Arabian Sea is characterized by the presence of large structural blocks located between th e western continental shelf of India and the deep seafloor of the Arabian Basin. Laxmi Ridge is presumed by most geoscientists to b e mostly continental (Talwani and Reif, 1998), and is separated fro m the western Indian margin by Laxmi Basin (Figure F2). There ar e isolated highs east of Laxmi Ridge, namely Wadia Guyot, togethe r with Panikkar and Raman Seamounts, which are collectively referred to as Panikkar Ridge (Karlapati, 2004; Krishna et al., 2006; Bhattacharyya et al., 2009; Mishra et al., 2015). The oldest clear sea

floor spreading–related magnetic anomalies identified in this region are Anomalies $27\mathfrak{n}$ $\left(62.2{-}62.5\ \mathrm{Ma}\right)$ and $28\mathfrak{n}$ $(63.5{-}64.7\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , located southwest of Laxmi Ridge in the Arabian Basin and north o f the Seychelles, respectively (Chaubey et al., 2002; Royer et al., 2002 ) (Figures F1, F2). Magnetic anomalies in Laxmi Basin itself ar e rather erratic, and whereas some researchers have argued that thes e correspond to seafloor spreading (Bhattacharya et al., 1994; Mishr a et al., 2012), it is possible that instead these could have been cause d by dikes intruded within a hyperextended continental crust (e.g., Talwani and Reif, 1998; Krishna et al., 2006).  

Previous studies using magnetic anomalies from the oceani c crust describe the juxtaposition of India and the Seychelles immediately before the onset of extensional tectonics (Chaubey et al., 1998; Royer et al., 2002). However, most plate tectonic reconstructio n models for this region suggest a wide deepwater offshore regio n (Laxmi Basin, Gop Rift, and offshore Indus Basin) of ${\sim}300\,\mathrm{km}$ widt h between the Seychelles and the Indian subcontinent before the onset of seafloor spreading (Chaubey et al., 2002; Royer et al., 2002). The tectonic complexity in this region is further increased whe n considering the massive Deccan magmatic event at ${\sim}65\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . It is no t yet convincingly known whether eruption of the Deccan flood basalt predates the rifting in Laxmi Basin or otherwise. Lack of geochronological data from Laxmi Basin makes it difficult to correlat e the opening of the basin to the Deccan volcanism in the Late Cretaceous. Numerous geophysical studies to investigate the nature o f crust in Laxmi Basin remain inconclusive, with some authors favoring the presence of rifted continental crust (Naini, 1980; Naini an d Talwani, 1983; Kolla and Coumes, 1990; Miles and Roest, 1993; Miles et al., 1998; Radha Krishna et al., 2002; Krishna et al., 2006; Minshull et al., 2008), whereas others argue for oceanic crus t (Biswas and Singh, 1988; Bhattacharya et al., 1994; Malod et al., 1997; Talwani and Reif, 1998; Singh, 1999; Bernard and Munschy,  

2000). Testing of these competing models, largely based on indirec t geophysical data, requires direct sampling of rocks from the basement of Laxmi Ridge and Laxmi Basin since existing data are no t conclusive.  

Significant sediment cover overlies the basement of Laxmi Basin, with the oldest parts representing a rifted passive margin sequence. Since the onset of the India/Eurasia collision, the Indu s River and its associated tributaries have been the primary source o f clastic sediment into the Arabian Sea (Clift et al., 2001), and this Indus-derived sediment likely accounts for most of the postrift sedimentary section targeted during Expedition 355. Far lesser amount s are discharged into the Arabian Sea from mostly small rivers on th e steep western margin of India; however, these may have been important sediment sources prior to the India/Eurasia collision an d during phases when Indus Fan sediment was being fed to lobes o n the western side of the Arabian Basin. The substantial runoff fro m the Narmada River in central western India (Figure F1) is likely t o have been buffered by the wide and gently sloping shelf near th e margin. This is evident from the thick hydrocarbon-rich sedimentary sequences under the Indian shelf (Biswas, 1987; Gombos et al., 1995), but this river may have been an important supplier at certai n times, such as during sea level lowstands.  

Much of the present Indus River discharge represents runof f during the summer monsoon rains, enhanced with the seasona l melting of Karakoram and Himalayan glaciers (Garzanti et al., 2005). The Indus Fan covers more than one million square kilometers, stretching ${\sim}1500~\mathrm{km}$ into the Arabian Sea from the presen t delta front. It is the second largest submarine fan in the world and i s ${>}10~\mathrm{km}$ thick at the northernmost part (Clift et al., 2002). As th e proto-Indus Fan prograded southward, characteristic sedimen t eroded from the Indus drainage began to accumulate on the distal parts, as observed at Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 22 1 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1974; Kolla and Coumes, 1987). The Indus River may have experienced major drainage capture during th e Miocene (Clift and Blusztajn, 2005) but has otherwise been stabl e within the Indus Suture Zone and western syntaxis of the Himalay a since the Eocene.  

Drilling can provide erosion records through analyses of th e sediment cores, as well as by providing age control for the regional seismic stratigraphy. It is only by quantifying the volume of sediment deposited in the fan that we will be able to mass balance th e volume of bedrock eroded from the mountains, constrained b y thermochronology, with the volume of eroded rock deposited in th e offshore and in the foreland basin.  

# Stratigraphic framework  

The general stratigraphy of the Indus Fan has already been defined by seismic surveying of the drilling region and the more proximal part of the fan (Figures F3, F4, F5). The youngest unit i s characterized by strongly reflective sequences that show small internal onlapping relationships in the vicinity of Laxmi Basin. Complex “cut-and-fill” channel bodies are also visible in this thic k uppermost sequence. Closer to the Indus Delta, this sequence i s dominated by channel-levee complexes that are typical of deepwater turbidite sequences (Kolla and Coumes, 1987; Clift et al., 2002). Sedimentation was active in such bodies during the Last Gla“Indus Fan Megasequence” by Droz and Bellaiche (1991). In th e area targeted by Expedition 355, additional sediment may also b e derived from the Narmada River and other smaller basins on th e west coast of India, as well as even some wind-blown dust from th e deserts of Arabia (Figure F1).

cial Maximum, but the fan has been largely dormant since the star t fed from the Indus Delta and interbedded with occasional pelagi c of the Holocene (Kenyon et al., 1995; Prins et al., 2000). This upper- carbonate deposits associated with sea level highstands when fluvial most unit is interpreted to be dominated by siliciclastic turbidite s sediment was trapped on the shelf. This sequence was termed th e  

Toward the northeast, the Indus Fan Megasequence overlies  a series of less reflective bedded units that are presumed to represen t distal muddy fan deposits. However, in Laxmi Basin, strongly reflective sediment overlies an acoustically transparent unit that thin s from north to south and from east to west across Laxmi Basin (Figure F3) and is inferred to have been derived from the Indian continental margin. This sequence is interpreted as a large mas s transport deposit called the Nataraja Slide and was shed from th e shelf edge around the middle/late Miocene boundary (Calvés et al., 2015). It is unclear if the unit significantly eroded the underlying deposits, but its top is rugged in places and inclined so that the Indu s Fan Megasequence disconformably overlies it, progressively onlapping over the submarine topography generated by the mass transport deposit as the basin filled. The transparent unit itself has ver y little in the way of internal patterns or structure but is bounded b y very prominent reflectors at the top and base.  

The unit underlying the Nataraja Slide is not well bedded o r clearly reflective but is also not transparent like the succeeding sequence. This unit, tentatively dated as Eocene–Oligocene in age before drilling, was interpreted as shales and siltstones forming th e early, distal Indus Fan. Regional considerations argue that the bas e of the fan may lie close to the base of the Eocene, below which lies  a highly variable, weakly bedded Paleocene unit that infills the rugge d basement topography. The unit between the rift onset and breaku p unconformities can be clearly identified on the seismic images. Thi s basal unit represents sedimentation during and after rifting alon g the western continental margin of India. The Paleogene unit thin s from east to west and reaches a maximum of ${\sim}0.4\;s$ two-way traveltime (TWT) in the central Laxmi Basin just to the east of Sit e U1456 (Figure F3), although it is thinner further north and wes t near Site U1457 (Figure F4). Further west, between Site U1456 an d Laxmi Ridge this unit is disrupted by a late-stage igneous intrusio n that penetrates well up into the Neogene and Quaternary section. The Paleogene, and indeed much of the younger cover, onlap s against and is cut out entirely against the side of Laxmi Ridge (Figures F3, F4). The Paleocene is thought to predate fan sedimentatio n and probably the onset of India/Eurasia collision. However, there i s no seismic evidence indicating the base of the fan, implying that th e lithologic change may be quite subtle. The source of sediment in th e Paleocene is inferred to be dominantly either rift related or fro m peninsular India to the east.  

The lowermost Paleocene section thickens toward the east to  a maximum thickness of ${\sim}0.4$ s TWT near parts of the Panikka r Ridge (Figure F3), especially where the ridge is very large. This Paleocene section is ponded away from the basement high underlyin g the drilled section at Site U1456 and onlaps the basement to th e west. The seismic signatures exhibited by this lower Paleocene uni t are slightly more reflective than the upper Paleocene section an d are associated with early rifting in Laxmi Basin. Although it is difficult to infer its composition, the reflective character compared t o the overlying distal Indus Fan sediment and hemipelagic units suggests that it may be composed of coarser grained clastic sedimentary rocks, and possibly volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks, linked t o Laxmi Ridge and neighboring seamounts along Panikkar Ridge.  

# Seismic studies/site survey data  

Extensive 2-D multichannel seismic data from the eastern Arabian Sea (Figures F5, F6) were utilized to develop a seismic stratigraphic framework. The regional seismic lines run in east–wes t (coast perpendicular) and northwest–southeast (coast parallel) directions (Figure F6). The seismic images exhibit major reflectiv e surfaces from the shelf through the deep Arabian Basin. We identified seismic units through correlation to available lithologic dat a from industrial boreholes in the vicinity, located on the Indian continental shelf. A high-resolution multibeam bathymetric survey wa s carried out to map seafloor morphology before selection of the proposed drill sites (Figure F7), all of which were located on relativel y smooth, muddy seafloor. Three primary and three alternate site s were chosen to meet planned scientific objectives of this expedition, and we ultimately cored at two of these sites, U1456 and U145 7 (Figures F1, F2). A broad seismic network provides good general control on the sediment thickness in the area.

# Scientific objectives  

Expedition 355 was designed to drill deep into the Indus submarine fan and sample the underlying basement at two of the sites. Th e primary objective was to better understand the erosional an d weathering response of the western Himalaya, Karakoram, an d Hindu Kush to the changing intensity of the southwest Asian monsoon since the onset of the India/Eurasia collision in the early Paleogene. Such interactions lie at the heart of many popular models fo r Himalayan tectonic evolution, such as the “channel flow” model i n which focused erosion, driven by climate (i.e., monsoon), control s the exhumation of deeply buried igneous and metamorphic rock s (Figure F8) (Beaumont et al., 2001; Hodges, 2006; Whipple, 2009). I f such models are correct, then there should be close coupling amon g structural evolution of the mountains, climate change, and sedimentation in the Arabian Sea (Clift et al., 2008; Whipple, 2009); however, testing this onshore is impossible because of the large Oligocene unconformity in the foreland that removed most of that record (Najman, 2006). Only in the offshore can continuous, readil y dateable erosion records be found. One goal of this expedition wa s to understand what feedbacks exist among climatic evolution, mountain building, and surface processes in the global-type area fo r these processes.  

In addition, coring the basement of Laxmi Basin should allo w dating of the age of continental breakup and so constrain the style o f strain accommodation between Laxmi Ridge and the western margin of India. Proximity to the Deccan Traps suggests that this margin could be a volcanic passive margin; however, this depends o n the relative timing of rifting and magmatism (Minshull et al., 2008). The role that mantle thermal anomalies, most notably the Réunio n Plume, have played in the breakup and subsequent formation of th e Indian Ocean and emplacement of the Deccan Traps is crucial. Thi s particular event has implications for biotic mass extinction events,

as well as for continental margin tectonics (Courtillot et al., 1988, 1999). Specifically, our objectives were  

1. To reconstruct long-term changes in erosion and weathering rates at submillennial to millennial timescales in order to compare with existing records of high-frequency climatic variability.  

Neogene sedimentary sections from the Indus Fan are expecte d to record the erosional and weathering responses of the Indu s drainage basin to changing climate, which has been reconstructe d using speleothem (Fleitmann et al., 2003), eolian dust (deMenocal e t al., 1991; Clemens and Prell, 2003), and upwelling/productivity records (Kroon et al., 1991; Prell et al., 1992), largely from the Oma n margin on the western side of the Arabian Sea. However, these records mostly do not extend back in time before $18\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

Links between climate and erosion on short timescales would b e expected if those proposed on longer timescales are correct. Attempts to understand the erosional response of landscape to climat e change in southwest Asia have largely been limited to the last glacia l cycle (Bookhagen et al., 2005; Dortch et al., 2009; Giosan et al., 2012; Blöthe et al., 2014); however, our sediment cores may permi t us to examine the changes spanning many such cycles. Specifi c questions include whether monsoon intensification causes less o r more erosion, and whether this erosion occurs in the Himalaya o r other mountainous regions, such as the Karakoram or western Tibet. Does a strengthening monsoon result in more grassland (C4) o r woodland (C3) flora? Are phases of increased productivity in th e Arabian Sea paralleled by changes in the continental environment s onshore, both driven by change in monsoon wind intensity? Wha t role does the westerly jet play in controlling continental environments within the Indus Basin? Could the intensity of chemica l weathering linked to monsoon intensity have a role in controllin g glacial cycles in the Northern Hemisphere through its role in controlling atmospheric $C O_{2};$ ?  

Weathering intensity will be reconstructed using bulk sedimen t geochemical analysis, selected isotope systems (such as Sr), and cla y mineralogy. These measurements must be performed in concer t with provenance work to establish whether any of the chemica l changes could be driven by changes in source composition or drainage capture rather than weathering intensity. Bulk sediment an d single-grain provenance methods, including heavy mineral studies, U-Pb dating of detrital zircons, Ar-Ar dating of detrital mica grains, Nd isotopes, and apatite fission tracks represent some of the methods known to be effective in this drainage system that will allo w tracking of changing patterns of erosion caused by waxing and waning of the monsoon (Clift et al., 2004; Garzanti et al., 2005; Alizai e t al., 2011).  

Age control is central to the success of this objective, especiall y if we are to estimate the lag times between climate change and th e sediment record of the deep basin. This is achieved using a combination of biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy. Oxygen isotop e stratigraphy is also intended to build a high-resolution age mode l that contributes toward the proposed objectives. Palynology, carbon isotopes, and leaf-wax organic geochemical studies will provid e further information on the evolving onshore landscape, as they ar e known to be effective at making such reconstructions in this regio n (Budziak et al., 2000; Ponton et al., 2012). The data from our expedition can then be correlated with existing climate records to determine links between erosion and climate on shorter timescales.  

2. To reconstruct changes in erosion and weathering intensity over tectonic timescales and assess whether any changes occurred at \~23, 15, and 10–8 Ma to test earlier hypotheses that invoke changes in monsoon intensity at those times.  

Competing hypotheses exist for the timing of initial monsoo n intensification based on a variety of proxies from across Asia, wit h some invoking the growth of the Tibetan Plateau (Molnar et al., 2010), the rise of the Greater Himalaya (Boos and Kuang, 2010), o r the retreat of shallow seas from Central Asia (Ramstein et al., 1997). Unfortunately, most of the existing climate reconstructions do no t span tectonic timescales, especially the critical start of Greater Himalayan exhumation and movement along the Main Central Thrus t at ${\sim}23$ Ma (Catlos et al., 2001; Godin et al., 2006; Tobgay et al.,  

2012). Without a long-term reconstruction of the erosion history, i t is impossible to judge which surface processes might control tectonic processes. At the same time, erosion of older sediment fro m the flood plain, as opposed to directly from the Himalaya, implie s that the deep-sea fan sediment can be used to constrain environmental conditions in the drainage basin. These in turn can be use d to infer the age of monsoon intensification and test the assumptio n that stronger monsoon rains change the flora and likely increas e rates of chemical weathering, due to higher heat and humidity, which in turn should result in delivery of more altered sediment t o the ocean.  

Improved  understanding  of  how  the  monsoon  and  erosion/weathering interact on short timescales (Objective 1) will allow us to better use the long-term erosion and weathering record t o reconstruct monsoon intensity through the Cenozoic. Upper Miocene to recent proxy records of monsoon intensity can be compare d to weathering and environmental proxies so that the relationshi p between the monsoon and weathering can be established. For th e period before ${\sim}18\;\mathrm{Ma}$ we have no independent climate record, an d the monsoon intensity for that time will likely be constrained fro m weathering and erosion records  whose interpretation  will  b e ground-truthed in the younger section where both types of reconstruction exist. Many tectonic models for the Himalaya link intensified erosion, driven by stronger summer monsoon rains, to the star t of Greater Himalaya exhumation (Hodges, 2006; Harris, 2007; Clif t et al., 2008); however, currently no well-dated, high-resolution erosion record spans this critical interval. Available records provid e only subepoch resolution (Rea, 1992; Métivier et al., 1999; Clift, 2006), so these models remain untested. Correlating changes in Himalayan-Tibetan tectonics with the marine record of erosion an d weathering is the key test for these mechanisms.  

Changes in sediment provenance tracked by a variety of bul k and single-grain proxies are needed to identify the focused erosio n that is predicted during Greater Himalayan exhumation. The timin g of the final unroofing of the Greater Himalaya is also poorly define d (White et al., 2002; Bernet et al., 2006; Najman, 2006; Szulc et al., 2006) and should be indicated by influxes of high-grade metamorphic minerals into the Indus Fan. Seeing whether the arrival of material from the Greater Himalaya coincides with, or likely follows, intensification of the summer monsoon rains would be a critical tes t of the channel flow and competing orogenic wedge models. Comparison of detrital mineral cooling ages with depositional ages will allow us to assess changing rates of exhumation in Himalaya sourc e regions in order to see how these are linked to climate change. Combining biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic studies t o generate an integrated high-resolution chronostratigraphy will allow the age of these provenance and thermochronologic changes t o be fixed.  

Determining the age of the base of the Indus Fan is a key objective, as this is only known in distal (and therefore young) location s at present (e.g., DSDP Site 221; Shipboard Scientific Party, 1974). Provenance methods and mass accumulation rates are expected t o show when the first detritus sourced from the northern side of th e Indus Suture Zone arrived in the Arabian Sea, beyond the tentativ e finding of before $45\,\mathrm{Ma}$ inferred from sediment cored on the Owe n Ridge at DSDP Site 224 (Clift et al., 2001). This age would provid e an important constraint on the much debated timing of initial India/Eurasia collision (Aitchison et al., 2007; Najman et al., 2010; W u et al., 2014). This age is of broader significance to Himalayan tectonics than simple local paleogeographic reconstruction because i t constrains how much Indian continental crust has been underthrust into the collision zone, since the rate of convergence is wel l known. Simple comparison of that volume with the size of the Tibetan Plateau will allow us to assess whether horizontal compression can explain all of the strain accommodation since the onset o f collision (England and Houseman, 1986; Dewey et al., 1989), or i f major “extrusion” of crust as rigid blocks along major strike-sli p faults is needed to accommodate the impact of Greater India (Molnar and Tapponnier, 1975; Replumaz and Tapponnier, 2003).  

3. To decipher the nature of basement rocks in Laxmi Basin and constrain the timing of early seafloor spreading and its relationship to the emplacement of Deccan Flood Basalts. Does mantle plume initiation predate or postdate rifting and early spreading?  

We planned penetration of $50{-}100\;\mathrm{m}$ of basement at two sites i n order to determine the nature of basement rocks and the age o f their  formation.  Although  biostratigraphic  and  magnetostratigraphic analyses conducted during the expedition will provide a n age for the oldest sediment overlying the basement, postcruise radiometric dating, using methods such as $^{40}\mathrm{{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{{Ar}}}$ , will be employe d to constrain the age of formation. Because the Deccan Traps hav e been very precisely dated onshore (Baksi, 1994; Courtillot et al., 2000; Chenet et al., 2008), the relationship between opening o f Laxmi Basin and emplacement of the Deccan Traps will be reveale d if the basin crust can be dated. This would further improve ou r knowledge of whether or not, and how far, Deccan Flood Basalts extend offshore (Pandey et al., 2010, 2011). The potential cause behin d the failure of rifting in Laxmi Basin to progress to seafloor spreadin g shortly after the opening in the more clearly oceanic Gop Basi n (Yatheesh et al., 2009; Chatterjee et al., 2013) is also not yet fully understood.  

Because the precise timing of rifting in Laxmi Basin is unknow n (Minshull et al., 2008), the indistinct nature of the magnetic anomalies in the basin leaves open the possibility that it is floored by eithe r slow-spreading oceanic crust (Bhattacharya et al., 1994; Misra et al., 2015) or hyperextended continental crust (Krishna et al., 2006). Geochemical analyses allow the composition of the volcanic rock s to be compared with Deccan Flood Basalts, rift volcanic rocks, an d mid-ocean-ridge basalts (MORB) that would have no linkage to  a deep-seated mantle plume or other mantle compositional anomalies. Sediment overlying the basement may potentially allow reconstruction of the margin subsidence, which can further be used t o look at the thermal state of the mantle under Laxmi Basin during it s rifting because positive thermal anomalies drive surface uplif t (Sleep, 1990). Many rifted volcanic margins, including those in th e Arabian Sea, are characterized by subaerial eruption and rapid subsidence (Calvés et al., 2008). The petrography and geochemistry o f overlying sediments, as well as igneous basement rocks, and th e seismic stratigraphic information should enable us to build the syn - and postrift history of the Laxmi Basin. If the volcanic sequences o f Laxmi Basin are linked to the Deccan Traps, then this would ad d significantly to their volume and thus to their potential environmental impact and role in the biotic mass extinctions at the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary (Courtillot et al., 1988; Self et al., 2008). The timing of rifting and bathymetric evolution of Laxmi Basin als o has significant implications for precise paleogeographic reconstructions of the Arabian Sea during the Paleogene (Chaubey et al., 2002; Royer et al., 2002), as well as for the lithospheric processes involve d in the rift basin formation.  

# Principal results Site U1456  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1456 (proposed Site IND-03C), the first site drilled durin g Expedition 355, lies within Laxmi Basin in the eastern Arabian Se a $\langle16^{\circ}37.28\mathrm{{N}_{\mathrm{{1}}}}$ , $68^{\circ}50.33\mathrm{\,E)}$ ) in $3640~\mathrm{m}$ of water (Figure F2). The site i s situated ${\sim}475~\mathrm{km}$ west of the Indian coast and ${\sim}820\,\mathrm{km}$ south fro m the modern mouth of the Indus River, which is presumed to be th e primary source of sediment to the area, at least since the Neogen e and likely since the Eocene (Clift et al., 2001).  

Laxmi Basin is flanked to the west by Laxmi Ridge and to th e east by the Indian continental shelf (Figures F1, F2). The nature o f the crust in Laxmi Basin has been the subject of vigorous debate. Some workers have proposed that it is stretched continental crus t (Miles et al., 1998; Todal and Edholm, 1998; Krishna et al., 2006 ) based on the reduced crustal thickness in Laxmi Basin $({\sim}6{-}7~\mathrm{km})$ compared to the neighboring thicker crust on either side (as thick a s $17~\mathrm{km}$ under Laxmi Ridge [Misra et al., 2015] and ${\sim}40~\mathrm{km}$ unde r peninsular India [Singh et al., 2015]). In this view, Laxmi Ridg e would be a continental fragment rifted from peninsular India (Nain i and Talwani, 1983; Talwani and Reif, 1998; Minshull et al., 2008). I n contrast, some workers interpret Laxmi Basin to be of oceanic affinity based on asymmetrical magnetic anomalies within the basi n (Figure F2). Such a model relates these magnetic anomalies to th e early phases of seafloor spreading in the Arabian Sea (Bhattachary a et al., 1994; Pandey et al., 1995), which removed a microcontinental Laxmi Ridge block from mainland peninsular India. In this case, Laxmi Basin would be more similar to its along-strike equivalent i n the Gop Rift to the northwest.  

Since the time of continental breakup in the Late Cretaceous– early Paleocene, Laxmi Basin has been largely tectonically inactiv e because seafloor spreading migrated away toward the southwest o f Laxmi Ridge (Royer et al., 2002). The seismic data from this regio n suggest that the process of gradual postrift thermal subsidence ma y have been interrupted by the emplacement of localized magmati c intrusions. Nevertheless there has been no strong deformation o f the basin since the end of extension, estimated to be prior to ${\sim}65\$ Ma based on magnetic anomalies within the basin (Bhattacharya e t al., 1994), or before 63 Ma based on the timing of onset of seafloo r spreading west of Laxmi Basin (Chaubey et al., 2002). Laxmi Basin, separated from the main Arabian Sea by the high topography o f Laxmi Ridge, has nevertheless been supplied by sediment from th e Indus River and forms the easternmost part of the Indus submarin e fan, the second largest such sediment body in the modern oceans. Proximity to peninsular India means that the basin has been the recipient of some sediment discharged from rivers flowing to the wes t coast of the subcontinent, most notably the Narmada and Tapti Rivers (Figure F1), although their discharge is much less than that o f the Indus River. Milliman and Syvitski (1992) estimated $125\,\times\,10^{6}$ ton/y for the modern Narmada River versus $250\times10^{6}\,\mathrm{ton}/\mathrm{y}$ for th e Indus River, although some studies estimate premodern Indus discharge as high as $675\times10^{6}\,\mathrm{ton}/\mathrm{y}$ (Ali and de Boer, 2008)  

Site U1456 is the focus of several scientific objectives central t o Expedition 355. Sampling and dating the base of the Indus Fan is  a primary objective of this expedition. The proposed deep penetration at Site U1456 was aimed at revealing the Cenozoic evolution o f the Indus Fan with the intention of reconstructing the weatherin g and erosion history of the western Himalaya. Sediment recovered a t this site should allow us to reconstruct patterns and rates of erosion, as well as to constrain how and when continental environmenta l conditions changed (e.g., humidity and vegetation patterns) in th e Indus drainage since the onset of the India/Eurasia collision. In particular, we aimed to test the hypothesis that the exhumation of th e Himalaya was driven by the changing strength of summer monsoo n precipitation. For instance, increased erosion along the souther n flank of the Tibetan Plateau in response to a stronger monsoon rainfall allowed the Greater Himalaya to be exhumed (Clift et al., 2008). Direct coupling of erosion rates and exhumation is a prediction o f the popular channel flow model for Himalaya evolution (Beaumon t et al., 2001; Hodges, 2006). Such coupling would also be applicabl e to some tectonic wedge models for structural evolution (Robinso n et al., 2006) and is not unique to the Himalaya (Willett, 1999). Because Site U1456 is located in the distal fan and we estimated reasonably high sedimentation rates based on seismic ties to industria l wells with age control on the outer western continental shelf of India, the site was also designed to document high-resolution change s in weathering, erosion, and paleoenvironment during the Quaternary that can be related to millennial-scale monsoonal change s linked to insolation and ice sheet–related forcing.  

In addition to the objectives related to Cenozoic evolution of th e Indus Fan, drilling Site U1456 was also planned to address question s pertaining to the nature of the basement of Laxmi Basin. In order t o test the hypotheses of whether Laxmi Basin is oceanic or continental, we need to directly sample the basement underlying the basin. The type of basement has significant implications for the breaku p history of India and the Seychelles. In addition, analyses of sedimen t retrieved from Laxmi Basin will allow us to constrain depositiona l conditions in a rifted basin. Such sediment may be used to reconstruct vertical tectonic motions and so determine the response o f the lithosphere to the syn- and postrift tectonic stresses associate d with continental breakup.  

At Site U1456, we planned to core to ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ into basemen t through the base of the Indus Fan to address the primary expeditio n objectives. However, we were forced to terminate coring in th e deepest hole of this site at $\mathord{\sim}1109$ mbsf (Figure F9), well above th e target depth of $\mathord{\sim}1590$ mbsf because of technical difficulties encountered when drilling through complex lithologies within a Miocen e mass transport deposit. The cored interval at Site U1456 include s an expanded section of upper Miocene to recent strata punctuate d by several hiatuses (Figure F10). Nonetheless, using the sedimen t samples and data generated at this site, we should be able to addres s the questions related to changes in the monsoon at ${\sim}8\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , as well a s how monsoon intensity varied after the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation. In addition, we cored through ${\sim}350~\mathrm{m}$ of a mas s transport deposit that likely represents the second largest know n deposit of this type in the geological record on a passive margi n (Calvès et al., 2015). Studies focused on this interval will help t o identify the source of these deposits, as well as examine how suc h large deposits are emplaced, and may help us to understand th e mechanism through which they are formed.  

# Operations  

After a 941 nmi transit from Colombo, Sri Lanka, the vessel stabilized over Site U1456 at $1054\,\mathrm{h}$ $(\mathrm{UTC}+5.5\,\mathrm{h})$ ) on 9 April 2015. W e cored five holes at Site U1456. The original operations plan calle d for three holes: the first to advanced piston corer (APC) refusal, followed by a second APC hole with extended core barrel (XCB) coring to ${\sim}650~\mathrm{mbsf}.$ . The third hole was a planned reentry of the hol e including $650\,\textrm{m}$ of casing, followed by coring to a total depth o f ${\sim}1590~\mathrm{mbsf},$ which included $100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of basement. The plan wa s modified to include a short APC hole for high-resolution microbiological and geochemical sampling of the upper ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sectio n (Table T1).  

When APC refusal was reached at a much shallower depth tha n anticipated $({\sim}140~\mathrm{mbsf})$ , we opted to deepen Hole U1456A usin g the half-length APC (HLAPC). Because of good hole conditions, w e continued coring in Hole U1456A with the XCB to 426.6 mbsf whe n the XCB cutting shoe detached and was left in the hole, forcing us t o abandon the hole. Hole U1456B was cored with the APC to 29. 1 mbsf. We then cored Hole U1456C with the APC and HLAPC t o 221.6 mbsf, drilled ahead without coring to 408.0 mbsf, and the n continued coring with the XCB to 465.2 mbsf. We terminated coring operations in Hole U1456C when we determined that the lithology at 465.2 mbsf would be ideal for the base of the casing for ou r deep hole. After conditioning the hole for logging, we conducte d three logging runs in Hole U1456C. The triple combo tool strin g was run first without the radioactive source to $465\;\mathrm{m}$ wireline dept h below seafloor (WSF), and then the Formation MicroScanne r (FMS)-sonic tool string was run to $465\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ with two upwar d passes. The last logging run was made with the triple combo tool string with the radioactive source after the hole was determined t o be in good condition.  

In Hole U1456D, we drilled-in a $10\%$ inch casing string to 458. 8 mbsf and then began coring with the rotary core barrel (RCB) coring assembly. When we reached $1024.2\ \mathrm{mbsf},$ , we pulled out of th e hole for a bit change; however, we encountered difficulties reentering the hole. The drill string became stuck in the open hole belo w the casing and ultimately had to be severed, effectively terminatin g the hole. We then decided to install a longer $10\%$ inch casing strin g to 748.2 mbsf in Hole U1456E, drill without coring to 970 mbsf, an d then continue to RCB core to 1109.4 mbsf. We pulled out of the hol e for a bit change and again encountered difficulties trying to trip th e drill string back to the bottom of the hole. After little progress wa s made to advance the bit over a $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ period and several instances o f the drill string getting temporarily stuck, we decided to terminat e the hole and end operations at Site U1456. The total time spent o n Site U1456 was $885\,\mathrm{h}$ (36.9 days).  

A total of 197 cores were collected at this site. The APC corin g system was deployed 35 times, recovering $276.91\mathrm{~m~}$ of core ove r $301.9\mathrm{~m~}$ of penetration $92\%$ recovery). The HLAPC was deploye d 72 times, recovering $287.55\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $334.8~\mathrm{m}$ of penetratio n $86\%$ recovery). The XCB coring system was deployed 13 times, recovering $44.58\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over $94.3\;\mathrm{m}$ of penetration $47\%$ recovery). The RCB coring system was deployed 77 times, recovering $401.63\:\mathrm{m}$ of core over $705.0\;\mathrm{m}$ of penetration $57\%$ recovery).  

# Principal results  

The cored section at Site U1456 is divided into four lithologi c units based on a compilation of Holes U1456A through U1456 E (Figure F9). Lithologic Unit I consists of an ${\sim}121\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequenc e of Pleistocene light brown to light greenish nannofossil ooze an d foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze interbedded with clay, silt, an d sand. The sand layers show normal grading and sharp erosive base s and are interpreted as distal basin plain turbidites. The hemipelagi c nannofossil ooze and nannofossil-rich clay show intense bioturbation and also include common pyrite concretions. Quartz, feldspar, and mica grains are common in Unit I. Heavy minerals are rare i n abundance but include hornblende, kyanite, tourmaline, augitic clinopyroxene, apatite, and glauconite.

abundant in this unit. The presence of diagnostic high-pressur e sodic amphiboles (glaucophane) and pink-green hypersthene is distinctive of Unit II and indicative of erosion from the Indus Sutur e Zone. The most likely source of glaucophane is blueschists expose d along the Main Mantle Thrust in the suture zone in Kohistan (Anczkiewicz et al., 2000) and these would have to be delivered to th e main stream by the Swat and Kabul Rivers from the west.  

Upper Miocene to upper Pliocene lithologic Unit III is ${\sim}370\mathrm{~m~}$ thick and mainly consists of semi-indurated to indurated ligh t brown to dark green clay/claystone, light brown to dark gra y sand/sandstone, light greenish nannofossil chalk, and light to dar k greenish  gray  nannofossil-rich  claystone.  Clay/claystone  an d sand/sandstone cycles of sedimentation are separated by interval s dominated by nannofossil chalk and nannofossil-rich claystone. Sand layers typically have sharp erosive bases and normal gradin g into the clay-rich intervals. Low recovery in this unit makes i t harder to assign a depositional setting, but the turbidites may hav e been deposited in a sheet lobe. The lower part of Unit III contain s common wood-rich layers (as thick as ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{cm}$ ). Bioturbation i s mostly limited to intervals of nannofossil chalk and nannofossil-ric h claystone. The mineral assemblage of the silt fraction observed under the microscope is similar to that of Unit II, but heavy mineral abundances are different in the clay fraction. The assemblage is typical of erosion from the Greater Himalaya (Garzanti et al., 2005), although glaucophane is not observed.  

Miocene lithologic Unit IV is ${\sim}380\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick and consists of  a mixture of interbedded lithologies dominated by dark gray massiv e claystone, light greenish massive calcarenite and calcilutite, an d conglomerate/breccia, with minor amounts of limestone, especiall y toward the base of the unit (Figure F9). A variety of deformatio n structures indicative of mass transport deposits, including microfaults, soft-sediment folds, slickensides, and tilted to vertical bedding, are observed in this unit. The most common minerals in Uni t IV are quartz and micas, with trace to very rare occurrences o f heavy minerals. Clasts of vesicular volcanic rock and shallow-wate r limestone in the breccia point to a source on the Indian continental shelf (Biswas, 1987; Whiting et al., 1994), with probable erosio n from the Deccan Plateau province. No significant sediment suppl y from the Indus River is found in this unit, except for a $2\textrm{m}$ thic k sandstone and claystone bed below the base of the mass transpor t deposit. This lowermost sequence suggests that an early to middl e Miocene Indus submarine fan was active in the area at that time.

Calcareous and siliceous microfossils recovered at Site U145 6 are typical of subtropical to tropical assemblages. Diatoms an d radiolarians are only found in the mudline and uppermost core s from this site, whereas calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers occur in varying numbers throughout the succession. Diatoms in the mudline samples are well preserved and consist mainl y of coastal species, but these taxa are absent in the cored sediment. Diatoms are sparse and moderately preserved in the uppermost 1 0 mbsf, and the assemblage includes benthic and freshwater taxa tha t indicate transport to the site. Radiolarians are very rare but wel l preserved in the upper 120 mbsf and absent below this depth. Abundance and preservation of calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers depends on lithology. In general, calcareous nannofossils are moderately to well preserved throughout Site U1456, whereas planktonic foraminifer preservation varies from poor t o good. Both groups are common to abundant in Unit I. Nannofossil s are sparse and foraminifers are usually absent in the coarse-graine d intervals of Units II and III. Reworked Cretaceous and Paleogen e nannofossils are common through Units I–III. In lithologic Unit IV, nannofossil and foraminifer abundance varies significantly, fro m absent to abundant, and the assemblage is characterized by a mixture of Paleogene to early Neogene taxa that hamper age interpretation.  

The age model for Site U1456 is based on calcareous nannofossi l and planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy, together with magnetostratigraphy (Figure F10). The succession of bioevents indicate s that Site U1456 spans the lower to middle Miocene to recent but i s punctuated by several hiatuses of varying duration. The Indus submarine fan sediment at the base of the succession below the mas s transport deposit contains a nannofossil assemblage characteristi c of the early to middle Miocene. The mass transport deposit of Uni t IV appears to have been rapidly emplaced in the late Miocene base d on the presence of late Miocene nannofossils within two shor t hemipelagic intervals within the transported unit. After depositio n of the mass transport deposit, the sedimentation rate appears t o have been relatively consistent in the late Miocene at ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{cm/ky},$ although deposition was interrupted for ${\sim}0.5$ million years betwee n ${\sim}8$ and $9\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Another hiatus spanning ${\sim}2$ million years encompasses the Miocene/Pliocene boundary. The sedimentation rate i n the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene was again ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{cm/ky}.$ After  a 0.45 million year hiatus, sedimentation rates in the early Pleistocen e were much higher $({\sim}45~\mathrm{cm/ky})$ during deposition of Unit II. Th e sedimentation rate decreased in the late early Pleistocene to recent, averaging ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ .  

Geochemical measurements at Site U1456 were designed t o characterize the distribution of hydrocarbon gases, sediment geochemistry (including carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and carbonate contents), and interstitial water compositions. Sulfate concentration i n the interstitial water decreases sharply in the uppermost $60~\mathrm{mbsf},$ indicating anaerobic sulfate reduction. Below the sulfate reductio n zone, methanogenesis becomes an important process, which is reflected by an increase in methane concentrations between 60 an d 120 mbsf. Methane concentrations decrease to $\mathord{\sim}2000$ ppmv nea r the boundary between Units I and II $({\sim}120~\mathrm{mbsf})$ and then reac h maximum values within Unit II at $\sim\!360$ mbsf. This pattern could b e partly controlled by lithology, with higher gas accumulating in th e relatively porous silty sand and silt with sand layers.  

Alkalinity and ammonia in interstitial water are produced as byproducts of organic matter degradation in the upper 60 mbsf withi n the sulfate reduction zone. Increased alkalinity in this interval causes calcium and magnesium to precipitate as carbonate, resulting in decreases in calcium and magnesium concentrations. Manganese concentrations in the interstitial water also decline sharply i n the uppermost 70 mbsf within the sulfate reduction zone, where hydrogen sulfide is produced. Total dissolved iron is consistently lo w over this interval and may be removed, together with manganese, b y metal sulfide formation under anaerobic conditions. Silicon concentrations are higher $300{-}520~\upmu\mathrm{M})$ in the uppermost $120~\mathrm{mbsf},$ which may be caused by its release during the dissolution of biogenic silica, consistent with the near-absence of siliceous microfossils over this interval. Barium concentrations in the interstitial wate r increase from 250 to $450~\mathrm{mbsf},$ which could suggest high organi c matter diagenesis through this interval. Alternatively, barium coul d also be released through dissolution of barite under low sulfate conditions or through mineral leaching.  

Total carbon and $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ contents are variable at this site an d vary in concert with each other, indicating that most of the carbon i s present as $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ . Carbonate content is generally higher in Unit I, particularly in the nannofossil ooze and nannofossil-rich clay $\left(60-\right.$ $80~\mathrm{wt\%}$ ). Carbonate content is lower $(10{-}30\ \mathrm{wt}\%)$ in the silt an d sand-rich intervals of Unit I and throughout most of Units II and III, which are dominantly siliciclastic. Very high carbonate content $(70-$ $90\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) below 975 mbsf in Unit IV corresponds to the presence o f calcarenite, calcilutite, and limestone. Total organic carbon (TOC ) values at Site U1456 mostly vary between 0 and $2~\mathrm{wt\%}$ , with a fe w higher values in Unit IV. We report TOC/total nitrogen (TN) as  a preliminary estimate for the source of organic material. In general, the TOC/TN separates predominantly marine $\mathrm{(TOC/TN<8)}$ ) fro m predominantly terrestrial $\mathrm{(TOC/TN>12)}$ ) organic input accordin g to Müller and Mathesius (1999); however, a simple model of the factors influencing TOC/TN ratios is not always applicable. Hig h TOC/TN ratios atypical for algal source organic matter have bee n measured in organic-rich Mediterranean sapropel layers, uppe r Neogene sediment from the Benguela upwelling region, Eocen e horizons from the Arctic Ocean, and Cenomanian–Turonian blac k shales (Meyers, 1990; Stein and MacDonald, 2004; Stein et al., 2006; Twichell et al., 2002). In Unit I, three distinct intervals with hig h TOC/TN $(>\!20)$ , suggestive of predominantly terrestrial sources, correspond to beds of silty sand with nannofossils and silt wit h sand. In Units II and III, low TOC/TN values suggest predominantly marine to mixed sources of organic matter. Unit IV is characterized by high variability, with very high values within the $930-$ 1018 mbsf interval suggesting predominantly terrestrial input of organic matter. Correlation between TOC and total sulfur provides  a further general estimation of the source of organic matter in marin e sediment (Berner and Raiswell, 1983) and is consistent with the interpretations based on TOC/TN.  

A total of 72 whole-round samples $^{5-10~\mathrm{{cm}}}$ long) were collected at Site U1456 for microbiological studies. These sample s were taken adjacent to interstitial water whole-round samples fo r comparison with interstitial water chemistry. Samples were mostl y preserved for postcruise characterization of the microbial population using DNA/RNA, as well as lipid and cultivation-based studies. Fluorescent microspheres were added to the core catcher sub befor e the core barrel was deployed during APC coring to use as a contamination tracer. Samples were collected from the exterior, interior, and an intermediate position from each of the whole-round sample s to determine the potential extent of contamination. Examination o f the microsphere content of these samples was carried out on boar d and indicates that samples from the exterior contain higher concentrations of microspheres than those from the intermediate position.  

Microspheres were completely absent in samples from the interio r of the cores, indicating no apparent contamination. Some sample s were also analyzed for presence of a new microbial community. Sediment from 0–27 mbsf in Hole U1456B contains many specimens of eukaryotic species (fungi) and deep-marine invertebrate s (meiofauna). Additional analyses are required to pinpoint the phylogenetic positions of these new taxa, which will be addressed afte r the cruise.  

Paleomagnetic analyses of Site U1456 cores produced a magnetic polarity stratigraphy defined on the basis of inclination dat a because attempts to orient cores met with mixed success. A composite polarity log was constructed from detailed demagnetizatio n experiments on discrete samples from Holes U1456A, U1456C, an d U1456D (Figure F10). The polarity log was correlated with som e confidence to the geomagnetic polarity timescale with a total of 1 2 tie points ranging from the Brunhes (Chron C1n; beginning at 0.78 1 Ma) to the top of Chron C5n (9.786 Ma). In collaboration with biostratigraphic results, we identified three substantial hiatuses. Th e youngest spanned from within Chron C2n to the top of Chro n C2An.1n. The second spanned all of Chron C3n to the top of Chro n C3An, and the third eliminated Chron C4n through part of Chro n C4r.  

Rock magnetic studies were carried out on samples from Hole s U1456A and U1456D and point to a complex array of magneti c minerals including iron sulfides (greigite) and iron oxides (magnetite, maghemite, and hematite). No magnetic behavior indicative o f goethite was observed. Further study is necessary to determin e which minerals are likely detrital (with the potential of constrainin g weathering on the continent) and which formed during diagenesis.  

The physical property data collected for Site U1456 includes $P$ - wave velocity, bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, and natural gamma  radiation  (NGR)  on  whole-round  cores  from  Hole s U1456A–U1456E and additional measurements on split cores an d discrete samples including thermal conductivity; shear strength; $P$ - wave velocity; porosity; and bulk, dry, and grain densities (Figur e F9). Acquired data correlate with lithology, composition, and induration of the recovered section. Bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, shea r strength, and thermal conductivity generally increase with dept h from 0.8 to $2.4~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3};$ , 1500 to $3400~\mathrm{m/s}$ , 10 to $220\ \mathrm{kPa}$ (at $\mathord{\sim}360$ mbsf), and 0.8 to $2.0~\mathrm{W/(m\cdotK)}$ , respectively, whereas porosity decreases from nearly $80\%$ to $50\%$ at $150\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ and then to $\sim\!20\%$ at th e base of the recovered section. This indicates that sediment compaction plays a significant role in physical property variations.  

Lithologic changes correlate with variations in NGR and magnetic susceptibility, which range from 10 to 80 counts/s and 0 to 40 0 $\times~10^{-5}$ SI, respectively. Carbonate sediment has low NGR activit y (10–35 counts/s average) and low magnetic susceptibility (0 to $20\times$ $10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}_{\phantom{0}}$ ) and is dominant in Unit I and the lower part of Unit I V (deeper than ${\sim}975~\mathrm{mbsf})$ (Figure F9). Detrital sediment (such a s sand, silt, and clay, or their lithified equivalents) that are abundan t in Unit II have much higher average NGR activity (50–80 counts/s), magnetic susceptibility $\langle50\times10^{-5}$ to $150\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI},$ ), and bulk densit y $(1.8{-}2.0\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ than the sediment of Unit IV. Unit III and the uppe r part of Unit IV show variable NGR but generally lower and less variable magnetic susceptibility than the other units (Figure F9). Grai n density varies between 2.75 and $3.0\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ with no visible downcor e trend except for characteristically low and consistent values of 2. 7 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ in the lower part of Unit IV. Shear strength indicates that sediment ranges from soft $(0\mathrm{-}50\,\mathrm{kPa})$ above 200 mbsf to stiff (150–22 0 $\mathbf{kPa})$ ) from 200 to 360 mbsf, below which core material has a shea r strength $>\!220\,\mathrm{kPa}$ .  

Two downhole logging tool strings were run in Hole U1456C, the triple combo (NGR, porosity, density, electrical resistivity, an d magnetic susceptibility) and the FMS-sonic (NGR, sonic velocity, and electrical resistivity images) (Figure F9). All runs reached th e total depth of the hole at $465\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ . Borehole log quality was affected by an enlarged borehole above $200\,\mathrm{m}$ wireline matched dept h below seafloor (WMSF) and large and rapid variations in borehol e size were found between 200 and $370\,\textrm{m}$ WMSF. Below $370\,\textrm{m}$ WMSF, the hole diameter was mostly in gauge, with few washedout zones. Lithologic variations are apparent in the NGR, bulk density, porosity, and magnetic susceptibility logs, and these correlat e well with measurements made on the recovered cores from Hole s U1456A and U1456C. Density and sonic velocity increases from th e top of the logs at ${\sim}80\mathrm{~m~}$ WMSF to the bottom of the hole are du e largely to compaction and cementation with depth (Figure F9) . Large increases in NGR and bulk density occur between loggin g Units 2 and 3, which correlates to an increase in grain size from cla y to silt and sand. Formation temperature measurements made wit h the advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) on Core s 355-U1456A-7H, $10\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , and 13H indicate a geothermal gradient o f ${\sim}57^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ for the upper ${\sim}120$ mbsf.  

Distinctive changes in color, magnetic susceptibility, NGR, an d gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density were used to make holeto-hole correlations among the sediment from Holes U1456A– U1456C. We constructed a spliced section for Site U1456 from th e seafloor to ${\sim}142\mathrm{~m~}$ core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF). This spliced interval includes the lower Pleistocene $\left(\sim\!1.3\,M\mathbf{a}\right)$ to recent.  

We were also able to correlate core data from Holes U1456A an d U1456C to wireline logging data collected in Hole U1456C. Th e NGR signal was sufficiently high that we could make unambiguou s correlations between the core data and logs in the interval logge d through pipe $(0{-}81~\mathrm{mbsf})$ . Distinctive magnetic susceptibility signals were very useful for correlating cores to the logs between 15 0 and 450 mbsf.  

# Site U1457  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1457 (proposed Site IND-06B), the second drill site of Expedition 355, lies within Laxmi Basin in the eastern Arabian Se a $\left\langle17^{\circ}9.95^{\prime}\mathrm{N}\right.$ , $67^{\circ}55.80^{\prime}\mathrm{E})$ ) in $3534\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figures F1, F2). Th e site is ${\sim}490~\mathrm{km}$ west of the Indian coast and ${\sim}760~\mathrm{km}$ south fro m the present-day mouth of the Indus River, which is presumed to b e the primary source of sediment to the area, at least since the Neogene and likely since the Eocene (Clift et al., 2001).  

Laxmi Basin is flanked to the west by Laxmi Ridge and to th e east by the Indian continental shelf (Figures F1, F2). Site U1457 lie s on the western side of the basin at the foot of the slope leading t o Laxmi Ridge. The seafloor appears to be relatively flat in the vicinit y of Site U1457 (Figure F2); however, seismic reflection data sho w that the basement depth gradually increases to the east away fro m the site (Figure F4). The nature of the crust in Laxmi Basin is a n enigma. Some workers have proposed that it is stretched continental crust (Miles et al., 1998; Todal and Edholm, 1998; Krishna et al., 2006) based on the reduced crustal thickness in Laxmi Basin $(\sim\!6-7$ km) compared to the neighboring thicker crust on either side (a s thick as $17\,\mathrm{km}$ under Laxmi Ridge [Misra et al., 2015] and ${\sim}40~\mathrm{km}$ under peninsular India [Singh et al., 2015]). In this view, Laxm i Ridge would be a continental fragment rifted from peninsular Indi a (Naini and Talwani, 1983; Talwani and Reif, 1998; Minshull et al., 2008). In contrast, some workers interpret Laxmi Basin to be of oceanic affinity based on magnetic anomalies reported within the basin. This latter model relates these magnetic anomalies to the earl y phases of seafloor spreading in the Arabian Sea (Bhattacharya et al., 1994; Pandey et al., 1995), which removed a microcontinental Laxmi Ridge block from mainland peninsular India. In this scenario, Laxmi Basin would be analogous to its along-strike equivalent in Gop Rift to the northwest and Site U1457 would lie seawar d of the oldest magnetic anomaly, requiring Laxmi Basin to be floore d by oceanic crust.  

Since the time of continental breakup at the end of the Cretaceous, Laxmi Basin has for the most part been tectonically inactiv e as seafloor spreading jumped to the west of Laxmi Ridge after ${\sim}62$ Ma (Royer et al., 2002) so that the active extension is now far to th e southwest along the Carlsberg Ridge. Seismic data from this regio n suggest that the process of postrift thermal subsidence has been interrupted by localized magmatic intrusions, but there has been n o strong deformation of the basin since the end of extension, estimated to be prior to ${\sim}65\$ Ma based on magnetic anomalies withi n the basin (Bhattacharya et al., 1994) or before $63\;\mathrm{Ma}$ based on th e timing of the onset of seafloor spreading west of Laxmi Basi n (Chaubey et al., 2002).  

Although Laxmi Basin is separated from the main basin of th e Arabian Sea by the high topography of Laxmi Ridge, it has nevertheless been supplied by sediment from the Indus River and form s the easternmost part of the Indus Fan, the second largest such sediment body in the modern oceans. Proximity to peninsular Indi a means that the basin must have been the recipient of some sediment discharge from rivers flowing to the west coast of the subcontinent, most notably the Narmada and Tapti Rivers (Figure F1) , although their discharge is much less than that seen from the Indu s River. Much of the flux from the Narmada and Tapti Rivers woul d tend to be ponded on the eastern side or in the central part of th e basin rather than at or around Site U1457.  

Site U1457 was originally proposed as an alternate site for meeting our basement objectives. The proposed deep penetration at Sit e U1457 aimed to reveal the Cenozoic evolution of the Indus Fan wit h the intention of reconstructing the weathering and erosion histor y of the western Himalaya. However, predrilling seismic interpretation suggested that this record would be truncated compared to tha t found at Site U1456. Nonetheless, sediment recovered at this sit e should allow reconstruction of patterns and rates of erosion, as well as constrain how and when continental environmental condition s changed (e.g., humidity and vegetation patterns) in the Indus drainage since the late Miocene. In particular, we aim to test the hypothesis that major changes in the structural evolution of the Himalay a were driven by the changing strength of summer monsoon precipitation. For instance, the southward migration of the main thrust detachment fault to the location of the Main Boundary Thrust after 1 0 Ma (Meigs et al., 1995) may have accelerated the unroofing of th e Lesser Himalayan Duplex (Huyghe et al., 2001; Bollinger et al., 2004) and may be linked to the change in monsoon strength at ${\sim}8$ Ma. Because Site U1457 is located in the distal fan and we estimate d reasonably high sedimentation rates based on seismic ties to industrial wells with age control on the outer western continental shelf o f India, the site was also designed to document high-resolutio n changes in weathering, erosion, and paleoenvironment during th e Quaternary that can be related to millennial-scale monsoonal changes linked to solar and ice sheet–related forcing.  

Because we were unable to sample the older sediment sectio n and basement at Site U1456, Site U1457 was specifically planned t o address questions pertaining to the nature of the basement in Laxm i  

Basin. In order to test the hypotheses of whether Laxmi Basin i s oceanic or continental, we needed to directly sample the basemen t underlying the basin, which has potentially significant implication s for the breakup history of India and the Seychelles. In addition, analyses of sediment retrieved from Laxmi Basin will allow us t o constrain depositional conditions in the basin, which may be use d to reconstruct vertical tectonic motions and so determine the response of the lithosphere to the syn- and postrift tectonic stresse s associated with continental breakup.  

At Site U1457, we planned to core ${\sim}50\mathrm{~m~}$ into basement afte r penetrating a series of submarine fan sediments, as well as the larg e mass transport deposit encountered at Site U1456. Drilling was successful in reaching the basement, although we had time to penetrat e only $16.27\;\mathrm{m}$ of basement below the sedimentary cover, recoverin g $8.72~\mathrm{m}$ of basalt (Figure F11). The cored section at Site U1457 includes expanded upper Miocene to recent strata punctuated b y some hiatuses or condensed sections (Figure F12), as well as lowe r Paleocene sediment directly above basement. A long hiatus separates the Paleocene sediment below from the Miocene sedimen t above. Nonetheless, using the samples and data generated at thi s site, we should be able to address questions related to changes in th e monsoon at ${\sim}8\mathrm{~Ma}$ , as well as how monsoon intensity varied afte r the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation in response to thi s forcing. This is despite the moderate hiatus that occurs close to thi s time. In addition, we cored through ${\sim}190~\mathrm{m}$ of mass transport deposit that likely represents the second largest known deposit of thi s type in the geological record (Calvès et al., 2015). Studies focused o n this interval and comparisons with the thicker section sampled a t Site U1456 will help to identify the source of these deposits, as wel l as to examine how such large deposits are emplaced, and may hel p us to understand the causes of this major event.  

# Operations  

After a $62\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1456, the vessel stabilized ove r Site U1457 at $1330~\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{(UTC+5.5\h)}$ on 16 May 2015. The origina l operations plan called for three holes: the first to APC refusal, followed by a second APC hole with XCB coring to $\mathord{\sim}500$ mbsf. Th e third hole was planned as a single-bit RCB hole to $50\;\mathrm{m}$ into basement, which was estimated at ${\sim}970$ mbsf. We ultimately cored thre e holes at Site U1457, although the second hole was cored to a shallower depth than originally planned (Table T1).  

We reached APC refusal at ${\sim}110$ mbsf. In order to deepen th e hole more quickly, we opted to core a $4.7\,\textrm{m}$ interval with th e HLAPC, followed by a $4.7~\mathrm{m}$ advance without coring. In the interes t of time, we terminated the hole after reaching 144.8 mbsf. We the n cored Hole U1457B for stratigraphic correlation purposes in the upper ${\sim}110$ mbsf. After reaching APC refusal, we continued with th e HLAPC using the coring by advance method to 204.7 mbsf, wher e we terminated the hole to preserve enough time to reach our objective in the deep hole. Hole U1457C was drilled without coring t o 191.6 mbsf and then cored using the RCB to 1108.6 mbsf, which included ${\sim}16\mathrm{~m~}$ of basement penetration. Hole U1457C was terminated when time allotted for the expedition expired.  

A total of 136 cores were collected at this site. The APC corin g system was deployed 24 times, recovering $202.73\mathrm{~m~}$ of core ove r $218.9\;\mathrm{m}$ of penetration $93\%$ recovery). The HLAPC system was deployed 15 times, recovering $71.22\:\mathrm{m}$ of core over $70.9\:\mathrm{m}$ of penetration ( $101\%$ recovery). The RCB coring system was deployed 9 7 times, recovering $436.96\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over $917.0\;\mathrm{m}$ of penetration $48\%$ recovery).  

# Principal results  

The cored section at Site U1457 is divided into five lithologi c units based on Holes U1457A–U1457C (Figure F11). Lithologi c Unit I consists of a ${\sim}74~\mathrm{m}$ sequence of Pleistocene light brown t o light greenish nannofossil ooze including foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze and nannofossil-rich clay, interbedded with silty clay an d silty sand. Unit I here is similar to Unit I at Site U1456 in bein g mostly muddy and carbonate-rich. The silty sand layers show normal grading and sharp erosive bases and are interpreted as turbidities. The hemipelagic nannofossil ooze and nannofossil-rich cla y show intense burrowing and also include common pyrite nodule s and veins. Quartz, feldspar, and mica grains are common in Unit I, whereas heavy minerals (hornblende, clinopyroxene, epidote, garnet, and augite) are rare.  

Lithologic Unit II is ${\sim}311\mathrm{~m~}$ thick and is dated to the early Pleistocene. The unit consists mainly of light brownish gray to dark gra y silty clay and dark gray sandy silt. Silty clay layers are typically massive and interbedded with very thin gray sandy silt layers, which ar e interpreted as turbidites. Unit II at Site U1457 is similar in age t o Unit II at Site U1456, but the sediment is much finer grained. Ligh t and heavy silt- to sand-sized mineral grains are more abundant i n Unit II compared to Unit I.  

Unit III is ${\sim}450\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and consists of upper Pliocene to uppe r Miocene semi-indurated to indurated light brown to dark gree n silty claystone, light brown to dark gray silty sandstone, light greenish nannofossil chalk, and light to dark greenish gray nannofossilrich claystone. Nannofossil chalk and nannofossil-rich claystone cycles of sedimentation are separated by intervals dominated b y clay/claystone and sand/sandstone deposition. Strong bioturbatio n is mostly observed in the nannofossil chalk and nannofossil-ric h claystone. Silty sandstone layers are characterized by sharp erosiv e bases and grade upward into silty claystone intervals. The silt y sandstone and silty claystone of Unit III occasionally have very thi n $(<\!1\,\mathsf{c m})$ wood-rich layers, as well as large numbers of tiny wood particles. Unit III contains abundant light minerals with variabl e amounts of heavy minerals.  

Miocene Unit IV is ${\sim}225\mathrm{~m~}$ thick and consists of a mixture o f interbedded lithologies dominated by dark gray to greenish gra y massive claystone, light greenish massive calcarenite and calcilutite, breccia, and limestone, particularly toward the base of the unit. Deformation structures are widespread throughout this unit, includin g microfaults, soft-sediment folds, slickensides, and gently to vertically tilted bedding, which are indicative of a mass transport deposit. Light minerals are abundant in Unit IV, whereas heav y minerals are only present in trace amounts. Clasts of vesicular volcanic rock and shallow-water limestone in the breccia point to  a source from the Indian continental shelf, with probable erosio n from the Deccan Plateau province.  

The ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick Paleocene Unit V consists mostly of dar k brown to dark greenish gray claystone and dark gray to black volcaniclastic sediment that overlies the basaltic basement. There is  a major hiatus between Units IV and V determined from biostratigraphy, as well as the change in facies between debris-flow brecci a above and mudstone underneath. The dark brown massive claystone shows very small amounts of interbedded dark greenish gra y silty claystone. The thick-bedded dark greenish gray claystone contains black, discontinuous manganese layers and nodules, as well a s small $(1{-}3\,\mathrm{cm})$ gray inclusions and rare parallel bands that are identified as carbonate-cemented nodules. Unit $\mathrm{V}$ contains abundan t glass particles, trace amounts of light minerals, and no heav y minerals.

Core catcher samples and additional samples from split cor e sections at Site U1457 were analyzed for calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, diatoms, and radiolarians. Microfossil assemblages are typical of subtropical to tropical water masses. Diatoms and radiolarians are found in the mudline sample in Hol e U1457B, where they are well preserved. Diatoms in the mudlin e sample mainly consist of coastal species that have been transporte d to the site location. Diatom abundance decreases rapidly downcore, with specimens mostly restricted to the uppermost ${\sim}50~\mathrm{cm}$ at Sit e U1457. Radiolarians are very rare and poorly preserved in the uppermost cores and only occur sporadically below.  

Preservation of calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers varies from poor to good throughout Site U1457. Bot h groups are abundant in Unit I. Nannofossils are sparse and planktonic foraminifers usually absent in the clay/claystone that dominates Unit II. In Unit III, nannofossils are common in abundance, whereas planktonic foraminifers are less abundant and vary fro m rare to common. Reworked Cretaceous and Paleogene nannofossil s are common through Units I–III. Within Units IV and V, both nannofossils and foraminifers are moderately to poorly preserved an d present in varying abundances. There is also an interval characterized by mixed Paleogene to early Neogene taxa that hampers ag e interpretation within the lower part of Unit IV. Calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers are common in the uppermos t part of Unit V but rapidly decrease in abundance downcore throug h this unit, which overlies the basement.  

The chronostratigraphic framework for Site U1457 is based o n calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy, together with magnetostratigraphy (Figure F12). The succession o f calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer events indicate s that Site U1457 spans the early Paleocene through recent, albei t with a very long hiatus ( $[{\sim}50\$ million years) between lower Paleocen e and upper Miocene sediment. The biostratigraphic framework established at Site U1457 enables identification of three unconformities and an interval of mass transport in the recovered Neogen e section. Calculated sedimentation rates at Site U1457 suggest tha t the sedimentation rate appears to have been relatively consistent i n the late Miocene at ${\sim}17\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ , although deposition was interrupte d for ${\sim}0.50$ million years around 8 Ma. Sedimentation rates wer e somewhat lower after sedimentation resumed following this hiatus, averaging ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ during the remainder of the late Miocene. There is some evidence for a short interval dominated by slowe r hemipelagic sedimentation between ${\sim}6$ and $7.4\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . There is an ${\sim}2$ million years hiatus that spans the Miocene/Pliocene boundary an d early Pliocene. The sedimentation rate in the late Pliocene to earl y Pleistocene was ${\sim}4\;\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ After another ${\sim}0.45$ million year hiatu s in the early Pleistocene, sedimentation rates for the remainder o f the early Pleistocene were much higher $({\sim}58\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ during deposition of Unit II. The sedimentation rate slowed down from the lat e early Pleistocene to present, averaging ${\sim}7\;\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ .  

We cored ${\sim}16.27\;\mathrm{m}$ into igneous basement at Site U1457, recovering $8.72~\mathrm{m}$ of basalt. Texture ranges from aphyric to phyric. Th e aphyric material occurs in three intervals and consists mostly of altered glass. Phenocrysts vary from being absent to making up a s much as $10\%$ of the rock and are composed of clinopyroxene, plagioclase, and olivine. Phenocryst grain size ranges from 1 to $5~\mathrm{mm}$ , with a mode of ${\sim}3\;\mathrm{mm}$ . The groundmass is mostly aphyric and ma y contain mesostasis. The basalt is nonvesicular and massive with calcite-filled veins up to $3\;\mathrm{mm}$ in width and of variable lengths. Thes e rocks are classified as clinopyroxene-plagioclase-phyric basalt an d plagioclase-clinopyroxene-phyric basalt, with the former the mor e dominant lithology. The basalt is only slightly altered. Geochemica l analyses performed after the expedition demonstrate that thes e rocks are $\mathrm{Mg}$ -rich, low-K subalkalic tholeiitic basalts that are simila r to melts of primary mantle source.  

Geochemistry measurements at Site U1457 aimed at characterizing the distribution of hydrocarbon gases, sediment geochemistr y (including carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and carbonate contents), and interstitial water composition. Sulfate concentration in the interstitia l water decreases sharply in the upper 60 mbsf, indicating anaerobi c sulfate reduction. Below the sulfate reduction zone, methanogenesis is likely active, reflected by a peak in methane concentrations between 65 and 200 mbsf. A second interval of methane increase i s observed between 400 and 550 mbsf, which correlates with Unit III. Higher TOC values through this interval are indicative of lithologi c control on the methane concentrations. Below 590 mbsf, methan e levels do not exceed 10,000 ppmv and progressively decrease wit h depth.  

Alkalinity and ammonia in interstitial water are produced as byproducts of organic matter degradation in the upper 60 mbsf, within the sulfate reduction zone. Increased alkalinity in this interval helps to precipitate calcium and magnesium in carbonat e minerals, resulting in a decrease in calcium and magnesium concentrations. Manganese concentrations in the interstitial water als o decline sharply in the uppermost 60 mbsf within the sulfate reduction zone, where hydrogen sulfide is being produced as a result o f anaerobic organic oxidation reactions. Dissolved iron concentrations are low and decrease downhole, suggesting its removal fro m the interstitial water through metal sulfide formation under anaerobic conditions. Silicon concentrations are high in the uppermos t 110 mbsf, which may be caused by its release during the dissolutio n of biogenic silica, which is consistent with the near-absence of siliceous microfossils in this interval. Barium concentrations in the interstitial water increase somewhat between 600 and 850 mbsf, which could be a result of its release through barite dissolution under low-sulfate fluid conditions or through the leaching of aluminosilicate minerals.  

Total carbon and $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ contents are highly variable at Sit e U1457 and are tightly coupled, indicating that most of the carbon i s present as $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ . Carbonate content is generally higher in Unit I, particularly in the nannofossil ooze and nannofossil-rich clay $(20-$ $75\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) intervals. A decrease in carbonate content downcore fro m Unit I and Unit II reflects a transition to lithologies that are dominantly siliciclastic. Carbonate-rich intervals $(33\mathrm{-}47\,\mathrm{\,wt\%})$ in Unit II I correspond to intervals of nannofossil ooze. TOC values at Sit e U1457 vary between 0.02 and $2.58\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ . As with Site U1456, we report TOC/TN as a preliminary estimate for the source of organi c material. Typically high values $\mathrm{(TOC/TN>12)}$ in marginal basin s are interpreted as an indicator of terrestrial organic input (Mülle r and Mathesius, 1999). However, an alternative model to explai n high TOC/TN ratios, such as those observed in some organic carbon-rich marine sediments (e.g., sapropels and black shales), invokes marine algae synthesizing lipid-rich organic carbon durin g times of abundant nutrient supply and/or diagenetic factors (Meyers, 1997). In Unit I, three distinct intervals with high TOC/T N $(>\!12)$ correspond to beds of carbonate ooze. The dominantly hemipelagic nature of this lithology precludes confident assignment o f the high TOC/TN values to terrestrial input and awaits furthe r shore-based analysis. Intermediate TOC/TN values (4.5–11.4) suggest mixed marine-terrestrial organic input in Unit II and the uppe r part of Unit III. Low TOC/TN values (0.3–8.7) in Unit IV sugges t predominantly marine organic matter input. Due to time constraints, shipboard analysis of samples from Unit V and the igneou s basement were not conducted.  

A total of 12 whole-round samples $\mathrm{5~cm}$ long) were collecte d for microbiological studies at Site U1457. All samples were collecte d adjacent to interstitial water whole-round samples for compariso n with geochemical analyses. After collection, samples were immediately flushed with $\Nu_{2}$ and processed for shipboard analysis or preserved for shore-based analyses. Fluorescent microspheres wer e used as tracers during APC operations to help determine contamination in microbiology samples. Microsphere samples were collected from the exterior and interior of each core, as well as  a location in between. Microspheres were completely absent in samples from the interior of the cores, indicating no apparent contamination. Samples from intermediate positions contained a lo w concentration of microspheres, and the presence of significan t numbers of microspheres in exterior samples is a strong indicatio n of surface contamination to the outside of the core during the coring process.  

We analyzed some samples on board for microbial communit y structure. The direct microscopic observation of the core sample s found different kinds of meiobenthos in sediment from Site U1457. Preliminary results of microbial community structure and enumeration show that fungal communities are present at very low concentrations in samples from 0 to 100 mbsf. Those fungi living in th e subsurface form diverse communities and interactions with othe r living organisms. While surveying for possible symbioses betwee n fungi and meiobenthos, we found abundant assemblages in certai n zones showing that these may follow trends related to the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles. Shore-based molecular studies are required to support the evidence of their relationship and to pinpoin t exactly the phylogenetic positions of these potentially new extremophiles.  

At Site U1457 we performed paleomagnetic analyses on archive-half sections from Holes U1457A and U1457B and on discret e samples from all holes. Archive-half section measurements produced reliable results for the upper ${\sim}60$ mbsf; results were mor e ambiguous in the deeper sections. Discrete samples were fully demagnetized by alternating field treatment, and the inclination of th e magnetization’s stable component was used to define the magnetostratigraphy. A composite polarity log was constructed from th e three holes and correlated with some confidence to the geomagnetic polarity timescale with at least 16 tie points, which range fro m the Brunhes (Chron C1n; beginning at 0.781 Ma) to the top o f Chron C5n (9.786 Ma).  

Using the combination of magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphic data, we identified three substantial hiatuses or condense d sections. The early Matuyama (much of Chron C2r) and the top o f the Gauss (Chron C2An) may be missing or are condensed. Chron s C3n and C4n are completely missing. Similar to Site U1456, there i s an “extra” subchron that is not in the official timescale, which is located between the Cobb Mountain (Chron C1r.2n) and the Olduva i (Chron C2n). The identity of this subchron (which could be th e Garder [1.472–1.48 Ma] or the Gilsa [1.567–1.575 Ma] according t o Channell et al. [2002]) could help constrain the age model durin g this interval of very rapid sedimentation.  

Paleomagnetic data from the lowermost sediment cores are wel l behaved, with an average inclination of $39^{\circ}$ . If these are indeed Paleocene in age, they are reversely magnetized and translate to  a paleolatitude for the site of ${\sim}22^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , which is in reasonable agreemen t with a paleolatitude between $16^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ and $25^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ for $60{-}65\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Besse an d Courtillot, 2002).  

The physical property data collected for Site U1457 include s bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, magnetic susceptibility, and NGR o n whole-round cores from Holes U1457A–U1457C and additiona l measurements on split cores and discrete samples including thermal conductivity; shear strength; $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity; porosity; an d bulk, dry, and grain densities (Figure F11). Acquired data correlat e with lithology, composition, and induration of the recovered section. Bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, and thermal conductivity generally increase with depth from 1.4 to $3.0~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , 1500 to $5600~\mathrm{m/s}_{\mathrm{z}}$ , and 1 to $2.6\:\mathrm{W/(m\cdotK)}$ , respectively, whereas porosity decreases fro m $\mathord{\sim}80\%$ to $50\%$ in the upper $100\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ and then to $\sim\!20\%$ at the base o f Unit IV. Shear strength varies between 10 and $70\;\mathrm{kPa}$ in the uppe r 150 mbsf, indicating that the sediment is soft and uncompacted.  

Generally, the changes in physical properties are gradual, indicating that sediment compaction plays a significant role in physica l property variations (Figure F11). However, shifts in porosity, bul k density, and thermal conductivity are seen between lithologic units, demonstrating the influence lithology has on physical properties. For example, between Units I and II, lithology changes from sof t carbonate ooze and clay to detrital silt, clay, and sand, resulting i n increases in bulk density and thermal conductivity and a decrease i n porosity. NGR also increases across this boundary (from ${\sim}30$ to ${\sim}60$ counts/s), whereas magnetic susceptibility becomes less variabl e and is generally lower in Unit II compared with Unit I. At the base o f Unit IV below 1000 mbsf, $P.$ -wave velocity abruptly increases to values up to $4300\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , reflecting the occurrence of high-density calcarenite and breccia, which contrasts with lower values for th e overlying claystone $(2000~\mathrm{m/s})$ . NGR and magnetic susceptibilit y dramatically decrease over this same interval. A return to lowe r bulk density $({\sim}2.0~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ and $P$ -wave velocity $({\sim}2000~\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ ) occur s within Unit $\mathrm{V}$ above the igneous rock at the base of Core 355- U1457A-96R. The recovered basalt has characteristically high bul k densities $({\sim}2.6~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ , magnetic susceptibility ( $\sim\!3000$ instrumen t units), and $P$ -wave velocities $(4500{-}5500\ \mathrm{m/s})$ but low NGR $({\sim}1$ count/s). A geothermal gradient of $53^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\,\mathrm{k}/\mathrm{m}$ for the upper ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ was estimated from the APCT-3 measurements taken on Core s 355-U1457A-4H, 7H, and 10H.  

Distinctive changes in color, magnetic susceptibility, NGR, an d GRA bulk density were used to make hole-to-hole correlations between the sediment in Holes U1457A and U1457B. Correlation s were limited to these two holes because there was minimal overla p with the cored section of Hole U1457C, and there was no opportunity for wireline logging. We constructed a spliced sediment sectio n for Site U1457 from cores recovered from Holes U1457A an d U1457B. The splice is good down to ${\sim}88\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CCSF}$ or ${\sim}1.2\,M\mathbf{a}$ . Wit h appended cores, the Site U1457 splice was extended to $123.55\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF. Profiles in the spliced section of Site U1457 of magnetic susceptibility change (clay content) and color change $\mathrm{{[CaCO_{3}}}$ variations) are similar to those at Site U1456. Initial age correlation s support the hypothesis that lithostratigraphic correlations betwee n the two sites may also be chronostratigraphic.  

# Expedition synthesis  

Two sites were drilled during Expedition 355 (31 March–3 1 May 2015) in the central and western parts of Laxmi Basin in th e eastern Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean. Laxmi Basin separates the Indian continental shelf in the east from Laxmi Ridge in the west. Sit e U1456 lies within Laxmi Basin and was cored into the lower–middle Miocene. The second site, U1457, penetrated through the sediment column into igneous basement in the transition zone betwee n Laxmi Basin and Laxmi Ridge. In total, we recovered $1712\,\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and sedimentary rock, as well as $8.72\:\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement. We further collected downhole wireline logs at Site U1456 using th e triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings. We present here the initial findings of our analyses of these materials and data, which provide (1) an improved understanding of how the Indian Ocean firs t began to drift as India separated from the Seychelles and (2) partial constraints on erosion in the source regions that have supplied sediment into the Arabian Sea since that time. Much of the recovere d sediment was derived from the Indus River, and this provides u s with an opportunity to document the weathering and erosional responses of the western Himalaya to changes in monsoon strengt h during the time periods represented by the recovered intervals, largely during the latter parts of the Neogene. We also collected sediment that provides information about erosion and mass transpor t from the western continental margin of India.  

# Rift tectonics in the eastern Arabian Sea  

The eastern Arabian Sea formed as a result of the breakup of Madagascar and India in the mid-Cretaceous and subsequentl y between India and the Seychelles during the Late Cretaceous (Norton and Sclater, 1979; Courtillot et al., 1988). The rifting between India and the Seychelles is thought to have initiated in th e Gop Rift, leading to final continental breakup. Rapid rifting (Roye r et al., 2002) propagated southward into Laxmi Basin before abortin g after a ridge jump at the time of Anomaly 28 to the west of Laxm i Ridge (Collier et al., 2008). The nature of crust in Laxmi Basin ha s been the subject of vigorous debate. Sampling the igneous basemen t to obtain a field-based constraint on the history of the rift tectonic s was one of the primary scientific objectives of Expedition 355. I n order to achieve this objective, we originally planned to core ${\sim}100$ m into the basement at Site U1456 in Laxmi Basin. The sedimen t cover at this site was estimated at ${\sim}1470\mathrm{~m~}$ thick, so we planned a reentry system to improve our chances of success. We initially installed a casing string with reentry cone to ${\sim}455$ mbsf in Hole U1456D and then continued to core to $1024.4~\mathrm{mbsf}.$ After pulling out of the hole for a bit change, the drill string became stuck while trying to run back to the bottom of the hole. We ultimately had to sever the pipe and abandon Hole U1456D. Because we assumed that unconsolidated sands between ${\sim}500$ and 720 mbsf had collapsed around the drill string while trying to reenter the hole, we decided to install a reentry system in a new hole (U1456E) to 750 mbsf, below the base of the sand. Coring continued to 1109.4 mbsf in Hole U1456E. After once again pulling out of the hole for a bit change, we encountered similar problems trying to work the bit back to the bottom of the hole. At this time it became apparent that swelling clays were binding the drill string and the drill bit and we decided to abandon the site and attempt to achieve our deeper objectives (Paleogene and basement) at an alternate site (see Operations in the Site U1456 chapter [Pandey et al., 2016]).  

Although we were unable to core into basement at Site U1456, we did core through most of the postrift strata in the Laxmi Basin at this site, which can be used to reconstruct evolving erosion and environmental conditions in the Indus Basin. Furthermore, considering that surface processes (e.g., erosion) significantly control the dynamics of a rift basin by redefining the surface load distribution through infilling accommodation space, information collected at Sites U1456 and U1457 will be important for examining the postrift development of this basin and thus its origin. Physical and lithologic knowledge gathered from Site U1456 is equally important in determining the geometry and volumes of the sedimentary load. Wireline log data collected at Site U1456 should allow for better regional stratigraphic correlation and precise determination of postrift sediment budget.  

Because coring through the base of the fan into the basement was one of the primary objectives of this expedition, we opted to core at Site U1457, which was originally an alternate site for the basement objective. Site U1457 is located in the western Laxmi Basin, with a similar, somewhat reduced $(\sim\!1100\;\mathrm{m})$ , stratigraphy overlying the basement. We ultimately recovered $8.72\textrm{m}$ of basalt, as well as associated volcaniclastic sediment above it, using a single RCB bit in an uncased hole. Because the igneous basement at Site U1457 was recovered at the end of the expedition, we only described the cores visually while at sea. Shore-based geochemical analysis carried out after the end of the expedition shows that the basalt are Mg-rich, low-K subalkalic tholeiites. Trace element discrimination plots indicate a petrogenesis similar to those of island arc basalts; however, Laxmi Basin is not known to have been in a subduction setting. We infer that this signature may have resulted from involvement of mantle sources developed by contribution of an old subduction slab. However, further postcruise geochemical and isotopic observations on the collected cores will establish their precise origin, affinity, and age.  

Heat flow data measured at each site provide additional constraints to infer the rift history in Laxmi Basin. Average heat flow measured at Site U1456 is $57\,\mathrm{\mW/m^{2}}$ , whereas heat flow at Site U1457 is $60\;\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ . Comparison with other data from the Arabian Sea (Figure F13) shows that Laxmi Basin is warmer than many parts of the Arabian Sea, in particular those regions close to the Indus Delta and the Murray Ridge (Calvés et al., 2011). Sites U1456 and U1457 also have higher heat flow than those in the eastern and northern sides of Laxmi Ridge. This could be attributed to the latestage intrusion of volcanic features into the basin, west of Panikkar

![](images/db656ead0a496b02d262084d75d7df982236779d81eda98b32c13337736b5550.jpg)  

Ridge, as seen in Figure F3. Stein and Stein’s (1992) compilation of oceanic crustal heat flow data indicates that the observed heat flow values at our sites are equivalent to oceanic crust of 76 and $84\;\mathrm{Ma}$ age. If the magnetic anomalies interpreted by Bhattacharya et al. (1994) are considered to be a reliable estimate of the timing of extension, then rifting in Laxmi Basin would have occurred between 63 and $\mathbf{84\,Ma}$ (Anomalies 28–33). This age would be consistent with the measured heat flow values but requires that no later thermal rejuvenation occurred. However, late-stage intrusions are seen in the seismic profiles, making this assumption somewhat problematic. This is because if the heat flow at our drill sites is normal and oceanic then the lower values in the eastern and northern Laxmi Basin would be anomalous in that they are colder than oceanic crust of corresponding age. This in turn would imply either that the crust in those areas is not oceanic or that the measured locations are positioned in cooler than average regions related to local heat flow patterns. Heat flow tends to be normal or higher than average where oceanic basement is flat but depressed in the vicinity of seamounts, which themselves are elevated due to discharge of warm fluids where the sediment cover is thin or nonexistent (Villinger et al., 2002).  

The measured heat flow values are also compatible with models that consider Laxmi Basin to be extended continental crust. The basin has significant water depths that imply large degrees of extension. This combined with the clear presence of volcanic seamounts in the basin, especially along Panikkar Ridge, implies at least $200\%$ extension $(\upbeta>3)$ in order to explain melting in the ambient upper mantle (McKenzie and Bickle, 1988). Comparison with a pure shear rifting model (McKenzie, 1978) indicates that if $\upbeta>3$ , then heat flow should be $>54\mathrm{~mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ (rifting finished at $63\mathrm{~Ma})$ ) or ${>}48\ \mathrm{mW/m^{2}}$ (rifting finished at $84\;\mathrm{Ma}$ ). Because the younger age is more likely and extension should be somewhat more than $\upbeta=3$ $(200\%)$ , we conclude that our measured heat flow is also consistent with an extended continental origin for Laxmi Basin.  

Therefore, in order to distinguish between the two plausible models as described above, geochemical analyses and radiometric age dating of basement rocks obtained at Site U1457 are essential. The precise radiometric dating of the recovered samples will establish the rifting age. Geochemical data suggest that the basement i n the Laxmi Basin is high-Mg, low-K subalkalic tholeiitic basalt.  

# Fan sedimentation  

Drilling in Laxmi Basin at Site U1456 confirmed the presence o f thick upper Miocene and younger strata $\left({\sim}700\mathrm{~m}\right)$ , as observed o n the seismic profiles (Figures F3, F14). The presence of sandy channels within lithologic Units I–III shows that the fan is built up by  a series of overlapping lobes. Units I–III at Site U1456 and Unit III a t Site U1457 form parts of the Indus submarine fan. Although the locations of both sites are ${\sim}800\,\mathrm{km}$ from the modern river mouth, th e reflective character of the seismic image covering these units mark s them as being part of the Indus Fan Megasequence of Droz and Bellaiche (1991). This means that they are lateral equivalents of sequences with clear channel-levee complexes in the proximal uppe r fan. In those more proximal areas the channels are accretionary, no t erosive, features. Smaller channel-levee complexes are better developed around Site U1457 (Figure F15), but in both locations the reflectors tend to be mostly parallel and with only modest onlappin g relations between successive depositional packages. In contrast, th e seismic images show that the strata are incised by channels tha t have cut and fill geometries, and at Site U1457 drilling passe d through the side of one of these channels (Figure F15). Taken in thi s context, the units drilled at Site U1456 can be understood as representing not only records of weathering and erosion but also different parts of the fan architecture. Presently both sites lie within a n area that would be considered “lower fan” under the simple classification scheme of Walker (1978).  

Unit II at Site U1456 is by far the coarsest grained of the sequences recovered, although the low recovery in Unit III, which wa s only sampled by RCB coring through all but the top of this unit, ma y also be more sandy than is apparent from the recovery (Figure F9) . RCB coring is inefficient at recovering unconsolidated sand, an d this may lead to a bias in our documentation of the unit if the corin g preferentially recovered clay and claystone. The sand of Unit II ma y represent a depositional lobe on the fan where turbidity current s dropped their suspended load as they decelerated after exiting a n incised or leveed channel. Seismic evidence rules out this sequenc e being a channel complex, and there is also little seismic evidence fo r leveed channels in this area. Channel deposits are often stacke d massive sandstone (Hartog Jager et al., 1993; McCaffrey et al., 2002), but Unit II does not show this type of sequence. Instead, it is characterized by common muddy interbeds between the sand beds tha t suggest the depositional character is more distal. The cores, in conjunction with seismic data, indicate that Unit II is a “sheet lobe ” complex as defined by Mutti (1992), contrasting with the coarse r grained “mounded lobes” of Normark et al. (1979). Sheet lobes ten d to be more subdued in their bathymetry and are associated wit h muddier depositional systems, much like the Indus Fan. They ar e also associated with moderate to strong incised channeling, whic h is a feature of the sequence in the area of operations (Figure F14).  

If Unit III at Site U1456 is really sand rich below ${\sim}450$ mbsf, the n this sediment could also be a sheet lobe complex separated fro m Unit II by a ${\sim}75\mathrm{~m~}$ thick interval of more muddy sediment mixe d with carbonate deposits that would correspond to overbank or distal hemipelagic sediments (Figure F9). However, if the bulk of Uni t III is basically similar to the material that was actually recovered, then this unit would be more like a sequence of basin plain shee t turbidites that represent the distal equivalent of the coarser, thicke r bedded sheet lobes (Mutti, 1977; Reading and Richards, 1994). I n this context we can imagine Laxmi Basin being the recipient of sediment as sheet-like turbidites during deposition of Unit III, and the n being abandoned as the active lobe avulsed to other parts of th e Arabian Sea, followed by another pulse of coarse sand sedimentation as an active lobe was reestablished east of Laxmi Ridge durin g deposition of Unit II. We emphasize that changes in grain size probably represent autocyclic processes of avulsion within a fan comple x and probably do not represent changes in erosion rates onshore. Thus linear sedimentation rates at Sites U1456 and U1457 are no t proxies for rates of sediment supply to the fan on a regional scale.

Not e that the mass transport deposit (MTD) is much thinner at this location compared to Site U1456. The drill site appears to cut the edge of one of the larg e channels in the Pleistocene section.  

Why is Unit I so muddy and carbonate rich when global estimates of terrestrial erosion and deltaic/fan sedimentation point t o this being a time of very high erosion and sediment transport (Mé- tivier et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2001)? The Holocene of the Indu s Fan is characterized as mostly being a carbonate drape (Kolla an d Coumes, 1984), which is interpreted to reflect cessation of deepwater sedimentation as a result of postglacial sea level rise (Prins e t al., 2000) and subsequent sediment sequestration on the shelf and i n the upper canyon (Clift et al., 2014). Such an explanation cannot answer the relative lack of clastic sedimentation through the entir e lithologic Unit I because this covers the last $\sim\!\!1.2$ million years, spanning much of the Pleistocene, during which time there hav e been many sea level cycles and plenty of opportunities for the accumulation of “lowstand” fan deposits. We speculate that since $1.2\,M\mathbf{a}$ the active lobes of the Indus Fan have been located west of Laxm i Ridge, allowing a dominantly muddy and hemipelagic sequence t o accumulate at our drill sites. It is possible that the higher carbonat e content of Unit I could also reflect greater biogenic productivity an d a deeper carbonate compensation depth (CCD) at that time. Unit  I is a sequence in which there is also some influence related to discharge from peninsular India (see below).  

# Sediment provenance  

Reconstructing the erosion of the western Himalaya is a key goa l of Expedition 355, and consequently we need to distinguish sediment delivered from the delta of the Indus River from that whic h might be a product of erosion in peninsular India. Some of this wor k requires shore-based geochemical work, but initial studies on boar d are able to pinpoint the influence of the Indus River using traditional microscopy applied to heavy minerals. Sand and silt in Unit  I at Site U1456 show the presence of abundant muscovite, a mineral that is particularly common in the modern Indus River (Garzanti e t al., 2005) and in the Indus Delta since the Last Glacial Maximu m (Clift et al., 2010), as well as quartz and feldspars. Furthermore,  a strong link to the Indus River is demonstrated by the presence o f tourmaline, epidote, and especially high-grade metamorphic minerals such as kyanite and sillimanite (Figure F16). Augite was als o observed (Figure F16A). Although this phase is indicative of a volcanic source, this mineral could either point to erosion from th e Deccan Flood Basalts exposed on the peninsula or the Kohistan ar c within the Indus Suture Zone, making this a nonunique proxy. Evidence from combined Sr and Nd isotopes close to the Laccadiv e Ridge indicates variable sediment supply from the Indus River an d peninsular India to sedimentary basins at the foot of the continental slope and even perhaps from the Bay of Bengal driven by monsooncontrolled currents (Goswami et al., 2012). We do not rule out sediment supply from peninsular India to Laxmi Basin; we only argu e that the provenance indicates that this source appears to be a mino r portion of the flux for most time periods, at least at these drill sites.  

Unit II at Site U1456 shows a similar heavy mineral assemblag e to Site U1457, but the minerals are present in much greater abundance and with additional minerals including garnet, blue-gree n calcic amphibole, and clinopyroxene. Most significantly, microscopic analysis identified rare sodic amphiboles, such as glaucophane (Figure F16D) and hypersthene (Figure F16F), which requir e erosion from a source that experienced high-pressure, low-temperature metamorphism (blueschist facies) of a type normally associated with subduction complexes (Miyashiro, 1994). Few suc h sources are known in peninsular India. Proterozoic blueschists ar e known from the Delhi fold belt in Rajasthan (Sinha-Roy and Mohanty, 1988), but even those parts of this terrane that do drain int o the Arabian Sea are not currently rapidly eroding and would not b e expected to have undergone much exhumation during the Cenozoic. Instead, the presence of glaucophane and hypersthene strongl y

suggest erosion from the Indus Suture Zone where a series of subduction-related rocks are exposed. The best documented blueschis t exposures within the Indus catchment lie along the Main Mantl e Thrust in Kohistan in the Shangla area of that magmatic arc complex (Anczkiewicz et al., 2000). Other areas are known to hav e eclogites associated with continental subduction, such as the Ts o Morari Complex in Ladakh, India (Donaldson et al., 2013), and Kagan in Pakistan (Tonarini et al., 1993), but these do not yield larg e volumes of glaucophane, and in the case of Tso Morari, were no t likely areas of rapid erosion since the late Miocene. Other sutur e zone blueschists are eroded into the Brahmaputra and are not relevant here (Chatterjee and Ghose, 2010). This provenance demonstrates a direct link between the main stream of the Indus River an d the fan at Sites U1456 and U1457.  

Unit III at Site U1456 also shows a dominant Indus-derive d mineralogy, including blue-green hornblende, clinopyroxene, epidote, rare garnets, and trace amounts of kyanite, chloritoid, apatite, zircon, tourmaline, and rutile, but no glaucophane. This does no t necessarily mean that the river was not draining the Shangl a blueschists at the time of sedimentation but rather that erosio n from that area was heavily diluted by flux from other areas of th e hinterland, much as it is today (Garzanti et al., 2005). Additional dilution from peninsular sources is possible, but with current information  there  is  no  suggestion  that  this  was  volumetricall y significant.  

Much of Unit IV, which is interpreted largely as a mass transpor t deposit, has a different provenance from the overlying units. Heav y minerals found in this unit include hornblende, actinolite, epidote, and garnet, with traces of zircon, tourmaline, spinel, and rutile, bu t not the typical high-grade assemblage with abundant mica seen i n the three shallower units (Figure F16). For example, tourmaline ca n be found in granitic or metamorphic rocks but is not unique to th e Greater Himalaya. Breccia interbedded with the siltstone (discusse d below) is dominated by large fragments of shallow-water limestone, as well as much lower volumes of pebbles of vesicular basaltic rock. Unit IV provenance points to derivation from the western coast an d continental margin of India, where similar sediment is found, suc h as Eocene–Miocene carbonates in the western parts of the Bomba y offshore (Whiting et al., 1994; Rao and Wagle, 1997).  

The only exception to this otherwise uniform pattern for Uni t IV is the final lower–middle Miocene sandstone-dominated core a t the base of the unit in Hole U1456E. This shows a return to a different, Indus-like provenance with a heavy mineral assemblage consisting of hornblende with common epidote and garnet and rar e tourmaline, apatite, titanite, and chloritoid. These sediments represent the oldest evidence at Site U1456 for an active Indus Rive r draining a Greater Himalayan source in the late early or early middle Miocene. With only $2.82\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment recovered, it is not possible to define the depositional setting beyond this being a sandy fa n turbidite, which is most similar to the sheet lobe deposits in th e Pliocene–Pleistocene. There is a thin sequence of Paleocene brow n and dark gray claystone at Site U1457 that underlies the mass transport deposit, but its origin and nature are even more obscured, beyond  being  a  hemipelagic  distal  clastic  deposit.  Calcareou s nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer assemblages date these deposits to ${\sim}62–63\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , which is a little older than most estimates o f India/Eurasia collision (Najman et al., 2010; DeCelles et al., 2014). However, some reconstructions do predict collision even as early a s $65\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Jaeger et al., 1989; Beck et al., 1995), and a minimum ag e from the fan would be useful in assessing such end-members, if th e Paleocene did prove to be derived from within or north of the Indu s Suture Zone. The sediment itself is massive and muddy with modest amounts of silt. This could be a distal hemipelagic deposit to a n early Indus Fan or base of slope deposits of the western Indian continental margin, two alternatives that can be tested by postcruis e isotopic-based provenance analysis. The claystone becomes darke r and interbedded with volcaniclastic sediment and shows mor e manganese mineralization downcore. The volcaniclastic sedimen t includes coarse breccia of basaltic character, similar to the underlying basalt interpreted as proximal hyaloclastite deposited synchronous with the volcanism during extension of Laxmi Basin. Th e flows are massive and not vesicular, which implies that they wer e erupted in significant water depths, likely ${>}2000\ \mathrm{m}$ (Moore, 1970), as deepwater vesicular flows are mostly limited to subduction settings where volatile content is high. Although these depths impl y normal depths for a seafloor-spreading center, they also indicat e that there was no significant mantle thermal anomaly under the basin at the time of emplacement. This in turn indicates that Laxm i Basin may have opened before the start of Deccan Plateau magmatism at $65\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Courtillot et al., 1988).  

# Mass sediment transport  

Drilling at both sites resulted in sampling of a large complex o f mass transported sediment, which volumetrically is estimated to b e ${\sim}19,\!000\,\mathrm{km}^{3}$ , making it the second largest such deposit known fro m any passive margin worldwide (Calvès et al., 2015). This deposit i s substantially larger even than the Storegga Slide from the Norwegian margin that redeposited $3500~\,\mathrm{km}^{3}$ around 6200 years ag o (Bünz et al., 2003). Prior to our operations, the age of this mas s transport deposit was poorly constrained (Calvès et al., 2015). O n the basis of nannofossil assemblages and magnetostratigraphy, w e demonstrate that sediment lying immediately above and within th e mass transport deposit is dated at ${<}10.9\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , whereas sediment lyin g directly underneath the deposit at Site U1456 is dated as 13.5–17. 7 Ma (Figure F10). The hiatus under the deposit at Site U1457 is to o long to provide tight age control on the emplacement. Because th e catastrophic emplacement of these deposits may have caused significant erosion of the sediment present in Laxmi Basin before sedimentation, we do not interpret these ages to indicate that mas s transport continued for ${>}3.5$ million years. Instead, we conclud e that the section reflects at least two major phases of mass transport, probably both of them occurring at ${\sim}10{-}11$ Ma. A short interval o f hemipelagic claystone was found separating two sequences withi n which there is abundant structural and sedimentary evidence fo r catastrophic redeposition (e.g., small slump folds, faults, and hig h dips). In contrast, the claystone shows a normal paleomagnetic signature coupled with a microfossil assemblage that does not indicat e significant reworking of older microfossils, such as seen in the res t of the mass transport unit.  

Much of the mass transport deposit comprises claystone an d silty claystone, with soft-sediment deformation in the form of fold s and small brittle reverse faulting structures, consistent with being i n the toe region of a large-scale slump (Bovis, 2003). There are examples of larger faults with slickensides indicating brittle deformatio n at the base of the deposit, which is ${\sim}330~\mathrm{m}$ thick at Site U1456 an d ${\sim}190\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick at Site U1457. Steeply dipping beds and contorted, folded geometries mark the upper part of the main deposit, which i s draped by a subhorizontal muddy blanket likely deposited in the immediate aftermath of the event. There is no sharp lithologic chang e to distinguish mass transport sediments from the hemipelagic sediment, which are both composed of claystone. However, the mas s transport deposit itself, largely comprising lithologic Unit IV at bot h sites, contains sediment with a strongly reworked microfossil assemblage eroded  from  Paleogene to lower Neogene sources, whereas the drape has a coherent microfossil assemblage with littl e reworking.  

The mass transport deposit comprises two types of sediment. The first type is composed of well-bedded materials that have undergone soft-sediment plastic deformation. These were presumabl y originally deposited on the outer shelf or continental slope of western India and were then largely redeposited en masse into th e deeper parts of Laxmi Basin. This sediment tends to occur in th e upper part of the mass transport unit. The second type of sedimen t in the mass transport deposit is composed of breccia dominated b y angular clasts of limestone whose composition and microfossil content indicates original sedimentation in a carbonate-dominated setting and that must have been broken into the clasts that constitut e the breccia during the emplacement of the mass transport deposit. Massive calcarenite is also associated with the breccia toward th e base of the deposit. Suitable source rocks for these deposits ar e present along the western Indian Shelf (Rao and Wagle, 1997). A t Site U1456, the breccias are separated by a claystone-dominated sequence (Figure F9). This internal structure supports the suggestio n that the emplacement of the mass transport deposit took place i n two major phases. The breccia is associated with thick-bedded calcarenite that also represents high-energy resedimentation of carbonate  material.  Although  the  calcarenite  could  have  bee n deposited on the Indian continental shelf adjacent to a carbonat e platform and then transported into the present position, its association with the breccia units suggests that it represents high-energ y deposits linked to the mass transport process itself. Brittle deformation is associated with the base of the two breccia intervals, wherea s soft-sediment deformation dominated in the overlying muddier sequences.  

Each phase of mass transport could theoretically have bee n made up of smaller depositional episodes, but we do not anticipat e these being separated in time by long periods because there are n o other hemipelagic drapes identified within the cores. We think i t unlikely that Unit IV at Site U1456 represents a collection of small debris flows. The source of the mass transport deposit must be th e Indian continental margin because it preserves a suitable sequenc e of Cenozoic shallow-water and slope deposits (Biswas, 1987; Whiting et al., 1994). Even the Deccan volcanic rock clasts can be derive d from mass transport offshore because the province is known to extend out under the continental shelf (Karisiddaiah and Iyer, 1991; Pandey et al., 2011). In any case, suitable sources are not present o n any other topographic high adjacent to Laxmi Basin (i.e., Laxm i Ridge or Panikkar Ridge). Laxmi Ridge has local development o f shallow-water carbonates that must have accumulated soon after it s initial formation when the ridge crest was still located close to se a level and not in the $\sim\!3\,\mathrm{km}$ of water as observed today. Laxmi Ridg e does have a modest hemipelagic drape (on the order of a couple o f hundred meters thick, as observed along seismic Profile W06; Figure F3) but may not be a suitable source of shallow-water materia l spanning such a long period or for the voluminous amounts of cla y and siltstone observed.  

Moreover, given the long transport $\left\langle{\sim}400\ \mathrm{km}\right\rangle$ from the potential source region (Calvès et al., 2015), it seems unlikely that this deposit could represent the product of numerous small events, whic h would lack the gravitational potential to travel such great distances. Even if the precise origin of the deposit was disputed, the seismi c images indicate a single pulse that stretches almost $400~\mathrm{km}$ alon g Laxmi Basin, mostly north of Site U1456, without major simila r events before or after. The deposit we cored is therefore likel y caused by one or two large collapses of the outer shelf and uppe r slope. Such a collapse would be required to explain such long runout, large volumes, and the homogeneous character in seismic images. In contrast to the Storegga Slide, whose emplacement is associated with gas hydrate dissociation during a time of climati c change (Bünz et al., 2003), we do not yet understand what migh t have triggered the large-scale collapse of the Indian continental margin at 10–11 Ma.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 355 was designed to obtain sediment and igneou s basement samples from the eastern Arabian Sea to address tw o broad categories of objectives as outlined in the Scientific Prospectus (Pandey et al., 2014). Through coring into the sediment an d basement of Laxmi Basin during this expedition, we addresse d many of our primary objectives and also made some additional findings that have significant geodynamic implications. The principal objectives outlined for this expedition are  

1. To reconstruct long-term changes in erosion and weathering rates at submillennial to millennial timescales in order to compare with existing records of high-frequency climatic variability.  

All planned sites of Expedition 355 were designed to dril l through the fan sediment in the eastern Arabian Sea to examine th e erosional and weathering response of the western Himalaya, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush to the changing intensity of the southwes t Asian monsoon at millennial to submillennial scales. Successful coring with the APC and HLAPC, which provided very good recover y through the upper parts of the sections at both Sites U1456 an d U1457, provides an opportunity to reconstruct and model orbitalscale variations in erosion, weathering, environment, and climate. The well-constrained spliced sections generated through corin g multiple holes at both sites, in conjunction with a robust age model, provide a mostly continuous high-resolution record of weatherin g and erosion during much of the Pleistocene (since ${\sim}2.0\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ). Th e recovered intervals may allow us to determine whether the intensit y of Himalaya chemical weathering had a role in controlling glacia l cycles in the Northern Hemisphere. Significant hiatuses and/o r condensed sections at ${\sim}1.8{-}2.2$ and ${\sim}3.6{-}5.6\,\mathrm{Ma}$ mean that we cannot follow the entire Pliocene–Pleistocene climate variation i n terms of its erosional and weathering impact, but because a larg e number of glacial cycles are spanned by a relatively well recovere d and expanded section, the general pattern and response to monsoo n change by these processes should be amenable to study. The expanded section represented by Unit II at both sites provides an especially good chance to look at the erosional response to monsoo n changes at the millennial scale. The sandy character of Unit II at Sit e U1456 may represent an even shorter amount of time and be deposited in a small number of major turbidite events.  

2. To reconstruct changes in erosion and weathering intensity over tectonic timescales and assess whether any changes occurred at \~23, 15, and 10–8 Ma to test earlier hypotheses that invoke changes in monsoon intensity at those times.  

Cenozoic sedimentary sections from the Indus Fan are expecte d to record the erosional and weathering responses of the Indu s drainage basin to large-scale climatic changes. Deep penetratio n through the entire fan was intended to retrieve long-term continuous records. Site U1456 penetrated ${\sim}1110\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment cover, whereas sediment penetration of ${\sim}1100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ was achieved at Sit e U1457. Both sites cover the ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (late Miocene) and younge r section, which will enable us to examine proposed hypotheses o n tectonic scales. These include answers to questions such as whethe r monsoon intensification causes less or more erosion, and whethe r this erosion occurs in the monsoon-influenced Himalayas or othe r mountainous regions, such as the westerly influenced Karakoram, within the Indus catchment. Reasonably good age control and decent core recovery may allow us to ascertain if increased grasslan d (C4) and reduced woodland (C3) flora at ${\sim}8\,\mathrm{~Ma}$ is related t o strengthening or weakening of monsoon rainfall and what other environmental changes occurred through that time. For example, ar e phases of increased productivity in the Arabian Sea linked t o changes in continental environments onshore, and are both drive n by change in monsoon wind intensity? A moderate hiatus close to  8 Ma itself means that the record will not be continuous but the transition should still be resolvable. Shore-based analyses of core samples collected during Expedition 355 will further improve ou r understanding of sedimentation in Laxmi Basin and the provenanc e of this sediment during key intervals of climate change from the lat e Miocene to present.  

Unfortunately, with effective recovery limited to the past ${\sim}10$ million years, we will be unable to address whether monsoon intensification occurred at $15\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and in particular test whether Greate r Himalaya exhumation is linked to heavier rainfall and faster erosio n after ${\sim}23\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , as implied by tectonic models such as channel flo w (Beaumont et al., 2001). Recent suggestions that the monsoon migh t have been active during the Eocene (Licht et al., 2014) are also beyond analysis by Expedition 355 cores. Inability to penetrate dee p into the fan stratigraphy at either site further makes it impossible t o date the start of fan sedimentation, which would have provided  a minimum age to the controversial timing of initial India/Eurasi a collision. The presence of a short section $\left(\sim\!20\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ of Paleocene (62– $63\;\mathrm{Ma},$ ) sediment at Site U1457 should allow us to test whether India/Eurasia collision was before or after this time, and thus at leas t eliminate some of the more extreme early collision models.  

3. To decipher the nature of basement rocks in Laxmi Basin and constrain the timing of early seafloor spreading and its relationship to the emplacement of Deccan Flood Basalts. Does mantle plume initiation predate or postdate rifting and early spreading?  

Penetration to ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ into igneous basement after ${\sim}1470\mathrm{~m~}$ o f sediment cover was planned at Site U1456. This site was designed t o core through the base of the Indus Fan, in order to determine th e nature of basement in Laxmi Basin and to constrain rifting histor y and its relationship to Deccan volcanism. We planned a reentry an d casing system for this site because of the deep penetration and potential for unconsolidated coarse-grained sediment. Unfortunately, the complex lithologies encountered in the mass transport deposi t ultimately resulted in us having to abandon two attempts to reac h basement at Site U1456. In both cases, we were unable to work th e drill string back to the bottom of the hole after a bit change, likel y because of swelling claystone within the mass transport deposit (se e Operations in the Site U1456 chapter [Pandey et al., 2016]). Thi s unexpected development prevented us from coring the base of th e fan, as well as the basement at Site U1456. A third attempt to cor e into the basement during Expedition 355 was successful at Sit e U1457 and resulted in recovery of ${\sim}8.72\mathrm{~m~}$ of massive basalt and associated volcaniclastic sediment. Geochemical analysis indicate s that these are low-K, high-Mg subalkalic tholeiitic basalts that ar e not typical MORB, but instead have a mantle signature.  

Our objectives linked to the origin of the basin were further advanced by being able to core through most of the postrift strata i n Laxmi Basin at these locations. Because surface processes (e.g., erosion) significantly control the dynamics of rift basins by redefinin g the surface load distribution through infilling accommodatio n space, information collected at both sites will be significant for examining the postrift development of this basin and thus its origins. Physical and lithologic knowledge gathered from these sites i s equally important in determining the geometry and volume of th e sedimentary load. Wireline log data collected in Hole U1456 C should allow better regional stratigraphic correlation and precis e determination of postrift sediment budget.  

As well as the planned objectives, Expedition 355 also confirmed the presence of a huge mass transport deposit along th e western continental margin of India that had previously only bee n recognized seismically (Calvès et al., 2015). Prior to our expeditio n very little was known about the presence of this mass transport deposit, which is significantly larger than the well-known Storegg a Slide of Norway (Bugge et al., 1988; Bryn et al., 2003). Coring durin g Expedition 355 now allows us to constrain the extent, timing, an d volume generated by this large-scale catastrophic event with significant implications for geohazards on this and other margins.
