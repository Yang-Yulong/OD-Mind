# 1. Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expeditions 390C and 395E were implemented i n response to the global COVID-19 pandemic and occupied sites proposed for the postponed Expeditions 390 and 393, South Atlantic Transect 1 and 2. Expedition 395E completed most of the preparatory work that Expedition 390C did not have time to complete. The overall objective o f Expeditions 390C and 395E was to core one hole at each of the South Atlantic Transect sites wit h the advanced piston corer/extended core barrel (APC/XCB) system to basement for gas safet y monitoring and to install a reentry system with casing through the sediment to a few meters int o basement in a second hole.  

Expedition 395E started in Cape Town, South Africa, and ended in Reykjavík, Iceland, after 2 0 days of on-site operations. We cored to basement at two new sites, U1560 and U1561, and completed reentry systems at three sites, U1556, U1557, and U1560. These operations will expedit e basement drilling during the rescheduled Expeditions 390 and 393.  

Hole U1560A (Proposed Site SATL-25A) lies in ${\sim}15.2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ crust and is composed of carbonate-ric h sediments to 120 meters below seafloor (mbsf) and $2.5~\mathrm{m}$ of underlying basalt. A reentry syste m was deployed in Hole U1560B to 122.0 mbsf. We then moved to the sites at the western end of th e transect on ${\sim}61\$ Ma crust. In Hole U1557D, $10\%$ inch casing was deployed to 571.6 mbsf to deepe n the 16 inch casing that was deployed during Expedition 390C, and in Hole U1556B, a reentry system was deployed to 284.2 mbsf. The remaining operations time was insufficient to install a reentry system at the originally planned site, Proposed Site SATL-33B. Instead, we cored Hole U1561 A (Proposed Site SATL-55A) to 47 mbsf. It is composed of red clay and carbonate ooze overlying $3\,\mathrm{m}$ of basalt.  

The six primary sites of the South Atlantic Transect lie perpendicular to the Mid-Atlantic Ridg e on the South American plate, overlying crust ranging in age from 7 to $61\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . Basement coring wil l increase our understanding of how crustal alteration progresses over time across the flanks of  a slow/intermediate-spreading ridge and how microorganisms survive in deep subsurface environments. Sediment will be used in paleoceanographic and microbiological studies.  

# 2. Introduction  

In 2020 and 2021, the global COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the postponement of several International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) expeditions, chiefly because science parties wer e unable to travel to the ship. In response, the ship was used to conduct preparatory work for th e postponed expeditions that did not require a science party aboard but could be carried out by th e ship’s crew and a team of technicians from the JOIDES Resolution Science Operator (JRSO). Tw o of these expeditions were in service of IODP South Atlantic Transect (SAT) Expeditions 390 an d 393. The first was Expedition 390C, which sailed in October–November 2020 (Estes et al., 2021). The second was Expedition 395E, the subject of this report.  

Four of the SAT sites (U1556–U1559) were cored during Expedition 390C. However, there wer e difficulties installing casing into basement because Dril-Quip running tools were found to b e incompatible with use in hard rock. The release mechanism does not work when the casing strin g weight cannot be fully removed from the running tool, which can happen when the base of casin g is in basement. Therefore, at Sites U1558 and U1559, casing was installed to ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{m}$ above basement rather than a few meters into basement as planned. Site U1557 has a thick sediment cove r $(564~\mathrm{m})$ ), and a 16 inch casing string was installed to 60 meters below seafloor (mbsf) at this site. The extra time taken for troubleshooting meant that reentry installations could not be complete d at the other sites, and a second expedition was planned.  

IODP Expedition 395P (4 February–6 April 2021) was given the go-ahead by the JOIDES Resolution Facility Board to complete the reentry system installations without a science party. Unfortunately, Expedition 395P did not leave port in Cape Town, South Africa, because of COVID-1 9 cases among the staff and crew in the port call hotel and on the ship. Its operations were deferre d to Expedition 395E, which started in Cape Town on 6 April and ended on 6 June 2021 in Reykjavík,  

Iceland. Operations time was limited to 20 days because of the 3 week transit to Reykjavík at th e end of the expedition.  

The objectives for Expedition 395E were to core and install reentry systems at the remaining SA T sites. Coring one hole at each site was necessary to establish the depth to basement and for ga s safety monitoring. We used the advanced piston corer/extended core barrel (APC/XCB) system, and all rotary core barrel (RCB) drilling was deferred to Expeditions 390 and 393. The APC/XC B cores recovered during Expedition 395E will be considered part of Expeditions 390 and 393 for us e by their science parties.  

Having reentry systems in place at each site decreases the operational risk of the SAT expedition s and better guarantees that we recover the basement material needed to achieve the science objectives. The reentry systems were to be installed with the hydraulic release tool (HRT), except fo r Hole U1557D, where we used a Dril-Quip to be compatible with the existing reentry hardware. W e aimed to place the bottom of casing up to $5\;\mathrm{m}$ into basement to make a more stable hole for basement coring than if the sometimes unstable top of basement is left uncased. However, this was no t always possible because of local seafloor and basement surface topography.  

Expeditions 390 and 393 will recover sedimentary sections and the upper ${\sim}250\ \mathrm{m}$ of underlyin g ocean crust at six sites along a slow/intermediate spreading rate Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR ) crustal flow line at ${\sim}31^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (Figure F1). The expeditions will operate in a region last visited durin g Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 3, which helped verify theories of seafloor spreading an d plate tectonics. After $50\ \mathrm{y}$ of advances in drilling technologies and analytical capabilities, w e expect that a new transect will result in significant interdisciplinary contributions to our understanding of Earth processes. Transects of drill holes that sample both the sediment cover and th e uppermost oceanic crust in a particular ocean basin can provide essential knowledge of how interconnected processes have evolved over Earth’s history and responded to changes in external drivers such as atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentrations, oceanic gateways, or major ocean currents. Transects that sample tens of millions of years of ocean crust formed at the same mid-ocean ridg e (MOR) can provide important information about the duration of hydrothermal exchange. However, sampling both the sediment and the underlying basaltic basement in a specific ocean regio n has rarely been undertaken in a systematic manner, and the few transects accomplished cover relatively short intervals of Earth history (e.g., Juan de Fuca Ridge, $0{-}3.5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ [Shipboard Scientifi c Party, 1997; Expedition 301 Scientists, 2005; Expedition 327 Scientists, 2011], and Costa Rica Rift, 0–7 Ma [Anderson, Honnorez, Becker, et al., 1985]).  

On average, there is a discernible conductive heat flow deficit out to $65\;\mathrm{Ma}$ crust (e.g., Stein an d Stein, 1994), indicating that there is significant advection of heat from the cooling of the oceani c lithosphere out to this age. However, basement hydrological flow can occur in crust of all ages i f sufficient hydrologic heads can be established because crustal age is only one of a suite of interlinked parameters that influence the duration, depth, and intensity of off-axis hydrothermal flui d flow. Other key parameters include spreading rate, basement roughness, volcanic stratigraphy, an d flow morphology as well as sediment type, thickness, and completeness of basement blanketing. Simple relationships may not exist between crustal age, fluid flow, thermal and chemical exchange, and biological activity. Figure F2 summarizes potential relationships between these parameters.

# 3. Background  

# 3.1. Geological setting  

Expeditions 390 and 393 will operate along a transect at ${\sim}31^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ just south of the Leg 3 transec t $(\mathrm{\sim}28.5^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ . The new transect was selected with sites that will (1) target basement formed along th e same crustal flow line at similar rates $({\sim}13{-}25\;\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ half rate) (Table T1) and (2) recover section s of slow-spreading crust of comparable ages to the ocean crust reference sections in Ocean Drillin g Program (ODP) Holes 504B (7 Ma) (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1993) and 1256D $\left(15\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2003; Expedition 309/312 Scientists, 2006; Expedition 335 Scientists, 2012), which are located in intermediate- and superfast-spreading crust, respectively. The site location s were chosen to optimize recovery of material required to achieve multidisciplinary objectives. Thicker sediment layers are frequently targeted by scientific drilling to maximize the resolution o f paleoceanographic records. However, this decision has biased our sampling of in situ upper ocea n crust to regions with thick sedimentary cover (for holes that penetrate ${>}100\ \mathrm{m}$ into basement), which drilling as part of the SAT expeditions seeks to remediate (Figure F3). Rapid deposition o f sediment seals crust off from the oceans, resulting in anomalously hot basement temperatures an d potentially causing premature cessation of hydrothermal circulation. Consequently, most SAT target sites have sediment cover that is close to the global average thickness for their crustal age (Spinelli et al., 2004). However, because seafloor roughness is greater in slow-spreading ocean basin s than in fast-spreading basins (Spinelli et al., 2004), there are significant variations in sedimen t thickness and the continuity of coverage along the transect. Basement crops out at all ages alon g the transect (Estep et al., 2019) (Figure F4), and these topographic variations likely impact th e crustal hydrogeology. Two sites lie ${\sim}6.7~\mathrm{km}$ apart on crust estimated to be $61\ \mathrm{Ma};$ ; crust at Sit e U1556 underlies $278\textrm{m}$ of sediment, and Site U1557 (Proposed Site SATL-56A) basalts underli e $564\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment.  

The $15\ \mathrm{Ma}$ site (U1560, Proposed Site SATL-25A) was chosen for comparison to Hole 1256 D (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2003; Expedition 309/312 Scientists, 2006; Expedition 335 Scientists, 2012). The sediment sections cored at the 61 Ma sites (U1556 and U1557) are expected to captur e key Paleogene hyperthermals, including the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), an d the underlying basement will record the cumulative hydrothermal alteration of the uppermos t crust across the entire SAT. Another 61 Ma site (U1561, Proposed Site SATL-55A) provides a thinner sediment alternate to Site U1556. The 7 Ma site (U1559) provides the young end-member fo r investigating the evolution of hydrothermal and microbiological systems with crustal age an d allows comparison with similar-aged intermediate-spreading rate crust from Hole 504B (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1993). The 31 Ma (Proposed Site SATL-33B) and $49\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Site U1558) site s fill critical gaps in our ocean crust and deep biosphere sampling with respect to basement age an d major changes in ocean chemistry (Coggon et al., 2010).  

Leg 3 drilling results provide an indication of what to expect in the sedimentary columns of th e SAT sites (Scientific Party, 1970). During Leg 3, 10 sites were drilled in the equatorial and Sout h Atlantic Ocean between Senegal and Brazil, including 7 sites along a transect across the MAR tha t penetrated to basement (DSDP Sites 14–20). The basal sediment ages were within a few millio n years of the inferred magnetic anomaly ages, which is consistent with a half spreading rate of ${\sim}20$ $\mathrm{mm/y}$ since $76\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Recovery in the cored intervals was typically high $(>\!98\%)$ , but the sediment s were only spot cored, and there are significant gaps between cored intervals. The recovered core s make up an almost continuous Lower Cretaceous to Pleistocene composite stratigraphic section.

# 3.2. Seismic studies/site survey data  

The SAT is located along a crustal flow line where fracture zones are far apart, magnetic lineation s are clear, and there is little disruption in seafloor bathymetry (Figure F1). The Crustal Reflectivit y Experiment Southern Transect (CREST) cruise aboard the research vessel (R/V) Marcus $G.$ . Langseth  in  January  and  February  2016  conducted  a  detailed  geophysical  surve y (https://doi.org/10.1594/IEDA/500255) of the area, including a $1500~\mathrm{km}$ multichannel seismi c reflection profile from the ridge crest to the Rio Grande Rise spanning 0–70 Ma crust, two shorte r ridge-crossing profiles spanning $0{-}7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ crust, and five ridge-parallel profiles. Ocean bottom seismometer profiles were acquired coincident with the ridge-parallel profiles. Gravity, magnetics, multibeam bathymetry, and backscatter data were also acquired. Figure F4 shows seismic reflection profiles for Expedition 395E sites.  

The present-day MAR axis at $30^{\circ}{-}32^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ has a well-defined axial valley with two inferred activ e hydrothermal vents (Schmid et al., 2019). The CREST seismic survey crossed a ridge segment tha t is ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{km}$ long and bounded to the north and south by ridge offsets ${\sim}16$ to ${\sim}22\,\mathrm{km}$ in width. Th e absence of domal structures, which would represent oceanic core complexes (OCCs) formed b y detachment faulting, near the ridge axis and the well-defined marine magnetic anomalies on th e ridge flanks (Cande and Kent, 1995) are consistent with the accretion of Penrose-type layere d magmatic crust. Kardell et al. (2019) calculated ages and spreading rates from magnetic dat a acquired during the CREST cruise. Ages of the primary sites are estimated at 6.6, 15.2, 30.6, 49.2, and $61.2\;\mathrm{Ma}$ with half spreading rates of 17.0, 25.5, 24.0, 19.5, and $13.5\;\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y},$ respectively (Tabl e T1). If $20\;\mathrm{mm/y}$ is used to separate slow and intermediate spreading rates (Perfit and Chadwick, 1998), then the primary sites were emplaced at both slow and intermediate spreading rates.

Figure F4. Seismic reflection profiles for Expedition 395E sites. Sites U1560 and U1561 were cored and Sites U1556 an d U1557 were cased during this expedition, having been cored during Expedition 390C. Black lines $=$ cored depth. TWT $=$ two-way traveltime, CDP $=$ common depth point.  

Seismic imaging along the CREST transect shows, at all ages from 0 to $65\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , an abundance o f unsedimented, exposed basement outcrops that may allow the ingress and egress of seawater an d ridge flank hydrothermal fluids. This suggests that the crust is never fully sealed by sediment a t these ages (Estep et al., 2019) and that there may be long-lived and ongoing connection betwee n the oceans and uppermost basaltic crust with implications for biogeochemical exchanges and subsurface microbial activity. All primary and alternate sites are positioned in localized sedimentar y basins that are imaged on seismic reflection profiles. Unsedimented basement ridges are within $1-$ $2~\mathrm{km}$ of most primary sites (Figure F4). Sediment thicknesses were calculated using a constan t sediment velocity of $1800\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ .  

# 4. Scientific objectives  

The primary objective for Expedition 395E was to complete the work started during Expeditio n 390C, which was to lay the foundation for Expeditions 390 and 393 by coring a single hole to contact with hard rock and installing reentry systems at each site. By completing reentry syste m installations in advance, we better guarantee that the operational goals for Expeditions 390 an d 393 can be achieved, particularly RCB coring ${\sim}250\,\mathrm{~m~}$ into basement at each site. For th e APC/XCB hole at each Expedition 395E site, we intended to capture the sediment/basement interface using the XCB system with a polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) cutting shoe an d advance up to $5\;\mathrm{m}$ into hard rock material to (1) identify the depth of the contact with hard roc k and (2) recover this critical boundary for future sampling and study. During Expedition 390C, thi s system provided good recovery of the upper basement with minimal disturbance, complimentin g RCB coring planned for Expeditions 390 and 393. This interface is critical to documenting chemical exchange, alteration, and microbiological processes.  

Specifically, the following were the precruise operations objectives for each Expedition 395E site:  

• Proposed Site SATL-25A ( ${\sim}15.2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ crust): core with APC/XCB to $^{110}\,\mathrm{m}$ and install reentry system to 109 mbsf. (This became Site U1560.)   
• Proposed Site SATL-33B ( $\sim\!30.6$ Ma crust): core with APC/XCB to $145~\mathrm{m}$ and install reentry system to 144 mbsf. (This site was deferred to Expeditions 390 and 393 because of time constraints.)   
• Site U1556 ${\sim}61.2\ \mathrm{Ma}$ crust): install reentry system to 284 mbsf. (This site was cored to 284 mbsf during Expedition 390C.)   
• Site U1557 ( $_{\sim61.2}$ Ma crust): install casing to 570 mbsf to extend the reentry system that was installed to $60\;\mathrm{m}$ during Expedition 390C.  

Because the APC/XCB cores collected during Expedition 395E will be treated as Expedition 39 0 and 393 samples, an additional objective of Expedition 395E was to measure ephemeral propertie s of the APC/XCB cores. These include in situ formation temperature measurements made with th e advanced piston corer temperature (APCT-3) tool, physical properties, linescan images, X-ray images on the whole-round (WR) and split-core tracks, and paleomagnetic measurements on th e archive halves. In addition, we collected one sample per core for headspace gas analysis as well a s one to two WR samples per core for chemical analysis of interstitial water (IW). Geochemical dat a will guide chemical and microbiological sampling during Expeditions 390 and 393. A final objective was to collect samples to be distributed to micropaleontologists staffed during Expedition s 390 and 393 so that a preliminary biostratigraphic age model can be developed.  

Expeditions 390 and 393 have three main scientific objectives.  

# 4.1. Objective 1 (primary): quantify the timing, duration, and extent of ridge flank hydrothermal fluid-rock exchange  

# 4.1.1. Scientific justification  

Hydrothermal circulation at MORs and across their vast ridge flanks influences tectonic, magmatic, and microbial processes on a global scale; is a fundamental component of global biogeochemical cycles of key elements and isotopes (e.g., O, S, Mg, Fe, Li, B, Tl, and $^{87}\mathrm{Sr}$ ); an d facilitates geological $C O_{2}$ sequestration within the ocean crust. The chemical and isotopic composition of seawater reflects the dynamic balance between riverine inputs from the continents, buria l of marine sediments, and hydrothermal exchanges with the ocean crust (e.g., Palmer and Edmond, 1989). Ocean crust is young and chemically homogeneous compared to continental crust, and it s chemical exchanges with seawater are limited to a few relatively well-known reactions. Consequently, hydrothermal contributions to ocean chemistry are simpler to reconstruct than riverin e inputs (Coggon and Teagle, 2011; Davis et al., 2003; Vance et al., 2009). Knowledge of the rates an d magnitudes of hydrothermal exchanges will help us to decipher the changing global condition s responsible for past variations in seawater chemistry such as mountain building, changes in seafloor spreading rate, large igneous province emplacement, changing climate, and evolution of biological systems. Building this knowledge requires ocean basin–wide transects across ridge flank s with different hydrogeologic histories.  

Conductive heat flow deficits indicate that, on average, hydrothermal exchange persists at lo w temperatures $({\ll}100^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ to $65\,\mathrm{Ma}$ on the ridge flanks (Stein and Stein, 1994). Given the vast exten t of the ridge flanks, the hydrothermal fluid flux through them is many orders of magnitude greate r than that through high-temperature $(\leq\!400^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ axial systems (Mottl, 2003) and is likely importan t for elements for which fluid-rock exchange occurs at low temperatures (e.g., Mg, K, S, Li, B, C, an d $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O})$ ). Hydrothermally altered ocean crust provides a time-integrated record of geochemica l exchange with seawater manifested through changes in its chemical and isotopic composition, mineral assemblages, and physical properties (e.g., porosity, permeability, and seismic properties). The intensity of seawater-basalt exchange depends on the crustal age, architecture and therma l history, sediment cover, and spreading rate. Consequently, hydrothermal contributions to globa l geochemical cycles depend on the global length of slow-, intermediate-, and fast-spreading ridge s and the age-area distribution of the ridge flanks, which varied significantly throughout the Phanerozoic (Müller et al., 2008). However, the impact of these variations on geochemical cycles i s uncertain because the magnitude and spatial and temporal distribution of crust-seawater hydrothermal exchanges are poorly quantified. For example, the role of MOR spreading in controllin g past atmospheric $C O_{2}$ and hence climate remains controversial (Alt and Teagle, 1999; Berner et al., 1983; Gillis and Coogan, 2011; Staudigel et al., 1989) because of uncertainties regarding the rate, extent, and duration of hydrothermal $C a C O_{3}$ precipitation due to our sparse sampling of intermediate age ocean crust (Figure F5). The hydrothermal carbonates that sequester $C O_{2}$ in the ocea n crust also record the composition of the fluids from which they precipitate (Coggon et al., 2004 ) and provide an exciting opportunity to develop medium-resolution records of past ocean chemistry (e.g., $\mathrm{Mg/Ca}$ and $\mathrm{Sr}/\mathrm{Ca}\mathrm{}_{\prime}$ (Coggon and Teagle, 2011; Coggon et al., 2010; Rausch et al., 2013) that integrate past changes in major Earth system processes such as plate tectonics, mountain building, and climate. However, this approach is limited by sparse sampling of ocean crust of a variety o f ages.  

Drilling experiments on the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank were a key investigation of hydrotherma l evolution across a ridge flank but were restricted to young $\left<3.6\;\mathrm{Ma}\right>$ , intermediate-spreading (2 9 $\mathrm{mm/y}$ half spreading rate) crust (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1997; Expedition 301 Scientists, 2005; Expedition 327 Scientists, 2011). There is a dearth of holes in 20–120 Ma intact in situ MOR crust, and there are no significant penetrations $\left(>\!100\,\mathrm{m}\right)$ of $46{-}120\,\mathrm{Ma}$ crust (Figure F5) (Expedition 33 5 Scientists, 2012). Consequently, the critical thermal, hydrogeologic, chemical, and microbial transitions across the ridge flanks remain unknown (Figure F2). Our current sampling of in situ uppe r ocean crust $(>\!100\,\mathrm{m})$ is biased toward areas with anomalously thick sediment for their crustal age s (Figure F3), and the majority of holes in ocean crust older than $35\;\mathrm{Ma}$ penetrate intermediate- o r fast-spreading crust. The recovery of uppermost basement sections along the SAT acros s slow/intermediate-spreading MAR crust will address these sampling gaps with respect to age, spreading rate, and sediment thickness.  

Crustal accretion along the northern MAR is complex, and there are significant regions wher e spreading is accommodated by amagmatic extension by detachment faults that exhume section s of deep lithosphere to form OCCs (Mallows and Searle, 2012). However, a recent survey of th e modern southern MAR during Cruise MSM25 of the R/V Maria S. Merian (2013) found no OCC s between $25^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ and $33^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (Devey, 2014). This, combined with the relatively well defined marine magnetic anomalies on the southern MAR flanks (Maus et al., 2009), is consistent with accretion o f intact magmatic crust. Because the ${\sim}31^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ SAT follows a crustal flow line through a relatively lon g spreading segment $^{'}{\sim}100\,\mathrm{km})$ away from major transform faults, we expect a Penrose-type stratigraphy of lavas overlying dikes and gabbros to have been accreted along the transect (Penros e Conference Participants, 1972).  

# 4.1.2. Expected outcomes  

Hydrothermal alteration of basement cores will be investigated using a combination of petrological and geochemical analyses, radiometric dating, and detailed quantitative core logging o f rock types, alteration features, and veins. The recovery of thinly sedimented slow/intermediatespreading ocean crust along the proposed SAT will provide the following opportunities:  

• To determine the nature, rates, magnitudes, distribution, and duration of hydrothermal alteration across the ridge flank;   
• To investigate the effect of titanomagnetite/titanomaghemite alteration on the magnetic anomaly signal to elucidate its origin;   
• To compare hydrothermal alteration of the uppermost slow/intermediate-spreading crust with crust of similar ages produced at faster spreading ridges (e.g., Holes 504B and 1256D);   
• To evaluate the effect of changes in global spreading rates and the age-area distribution of the seafloor on hydrothermal contributions to global biogeochemical cycles; and   
• To investigate signatures of changing ocean chemistry in the hydrothermal record and develop medium-resolution records of past ocean chemistry using hydrothermal minerals (following Coggon et al., 2010).  

It will also allow us to test the following hypotheses:  

• Hydrothermal chemical exchange ceases within 20 My of crustal formation. • Basement topography and sedimentation history affect the rate and duration of hydrothermal alteration.

# 4.2. Objective 2 (primary): investigate sediment- and basementhosted microbial community variation with substrate composition and age  

# 4.2.1. Scientific justification  

Scientific ocean drilling has revealed that microorganisms, Archaea, Bacteria, and eukaryoti c fungi and protists are present, intact, and metabolically active in uncontaminated deep subsurfac e sediment and basalt. Knowledge about subseafloor microbial communities has grown exponentially since the initial microbial investigations by DSDP in the 1980s, but ${<}4\%$ of ODP/Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program/IODP sites sampled have been sampled, documented, or archived fo r microbiological purposes (Kallmeyer et al., 2012; Orcutt et al., 2014). Determining microbial community composition and physiological capabilities along the SAT will provide insights into the rol e of microbes in mineral alteration, hydrocarbon formation, and global biogeochemical cycles.  

In sediments, the number of microbial cells present is estimated to equal that in the entire oceani c water column (Kallmeyer et al., 2012). However, the amount of biomass stored in the deep subsurface remains contentious because microbial cell abundance in subseafloor sediment varies b y approximately five orders of magnitude with significant geographic variation in the structure o f subseafloor communities (Inagaki et al., 2006). The majority of studies have focused on relativel y high biomass continental shelf systems (Inagaki and Orphan, 2014). Recent efforts, including Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 329 (South Pacific Gyre; Expedition 329 Scientists, 2011) and 336 (North Pond; Expedition 336 Scientists, 2012), investigated lower biomass sedimentary systems underlying oceanic gyres. Crucially, no data have been collected from the Sout h Atlantic Gyre (SAG). Such data would refine the global biomass census and improve our understanding of the global carbon cycle.  

The presence or absence of oxygen in marine sediments has profound implications for the quantity, diversity, and function of microbial communities. Oxygen penetration depth varies betwee n oceanic regions and settings, ranging from only a few millimeters in areas with high rates o f microbial respiration, such as on continental shelves, to the entire sediment column in extremel y low biomass sediments, such as those beneath the South Pacific Gyre (D’Hondt et al., 2015). Extrapolation of an observed global relationship between oxygen penetration and sedimentatio n rate and thickness indicates SAG sediment may be oxic to basement (D’Hondt et al., 2015). Durin g Leg 3, oxygen was not measured, but sulfate was detected near the basement. However, sedimen t organic carbon concentrations along the SAT are intermediate to those of North Pond, where oxygen penetrated tens of meters below seafloor and nitrate was present to basement, and Nanka i Trough, where oxygen was depleted by 3 mbsf and sulfate was depleted by 19 mbsf (Expeditio n 336 Scientists, 2012; Tobin et al., 2009; Orcutt et al., 2013; Reese et al., 2018). This indicates tha t oxygen is unlikely to extend to the basement at sites along the SAT, contrary to model prediction s (D’Hondt et al., 2015), and that the classical redox succession of oxygen respiration followed b y nitrate reduction, potentially followed by metal reduction, may be present. However, we hypothesize that oxygen will be reintroduced at the bottom of the sediment column as a result of oxygenated fluid flow in the uppermost volcanic basement, which is the case at North Pond (Expeditio n 336 Scientists, 2012). The recovery of the sediment package will allow us to address this conundrum regarding oxygen penetration, biomass, and carbon limitation of microbial activity.  

We will compare the phylogenetic diversity, functional structure, and metabolic activity of SA G communities with results from previously studied regions. By exploiting the variations in sediment carbon composition expected across the subsiding MOR flank, we can examine the respons e of autotrophy versus heterotrophy to carbonate chemistry. Additionally, previous studies of th e sedimentary deep biosphere have explored community diversity based on site-to-site or downhol e (age) comparisons, often implicitly assuming a similar “starter community” that colonized the seafloor and whose structure and function subsequently changed in response to evolving geochemical conditions or burial depth. However, recent work suggests energy limitation may preclud e replication (Lever et al., 2015; Lomstein et al., 2012) and thus limit community changes. The proposed age-transect approach will allow us to test this assumption directly by investigating th e impact of burial depth and chemical zonation on sediment of the same age and hence the sam e starter community.  

Given the dearth of basement holes in ocean crust of intermediate age, there are no microbiological samples across the critical ridge–flank transitions in basement properties that may affec t microbial communities (Figure F2). The majority of biological alteration of subseafloor basalts i s thought to occur within 20 My of crustal formation (Bach and Edwards, 2003). However, microbiological investigations of oceanic basement have focused on young $(<\!10\;\mathrm{Ma})$ crust (Jungbluth e t al., 2013; Lever et al., 2013; Mason et al., 2010; Orcutt et al., 2011) or older $_{>65}$ Ma) lava associated with hotspot volcanism along the Louisville seamount trail (Expedition 330 Scientists, 2012; Sylvan et al., 2015). Basement outcrops that penetrate the relatively impermeable sediment provide permeable conduits that facilitate subseafloor fluid circulation in older basement (Wheat an d Fisher, 2008). Fluid flow across the sediment/basement interface can produce redox gradients tha t provide recharge of depleted electron acceptors (e.g., oxygen and nitrate) to basal sediments, a s observed above 3.5 and 8 Ma ocean crust on the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank (Engelen et al., 2008) an d at North Pond (Orcutt et al., 2013), respectively. However, the extent and duration of fluid flo w through this interface across the ridge flanks remains unknown (Figure F2). The recovery of th e uppermost basaltic basement from 7 to 61 Ma along the SAT will allow us to determine whethe r microbial populations are indeed present in basement older than $20\ \mathrm{Ma}$ and to investigate th e nature, extent, and duration of communication between the sedimentary and crustal biosphere fo r the first time.  

# 4.2.2. Expected outcomes  

We will sample subseafloor populations of Bacteria, Archaea, and microbial eukaryotes in bot h the sedimentary and upper crustal ecosystems along the proposed transect, quantify their biomas s by cell enumeration, identify them using molecular biology methods, measure the stable isotopi c composition (C, N, and S) of sediment and basement to relate processes to geochemistry, measur e their metabolic activities using a variety of incubation assays, and resolve their physiological adaptations with omics-based approaches with the following aims:  

• To evaluate cell abundance and community activity in the low energy subseafloor biosphere of the SAG and refine estimates of global subseafloor sedimentary microbial abundance;   
• To resolve model predictions about the depth of oxygen penetration into sediment from overlying seawater and into the bottom of the sediment package from oxygenated fluid in basement;   
• To evaluate the role of subseafloor microbes in sediment biogeochemistry and basement alteration and hence global biogeochemical cycles; and   
• To investigate how aging of the ocean crust influences the composition of the crustal biosphere, particularly the effects of changing oxidation state and permeability on microbial abundance, diversity, and function.  

Our samples will also allow us to test the following hypotheses:  

• SAG microbial communities share membership and function with both oligotrophic sediments, like those found at North Pond, and open-ocean systems with higher organic matter input, such as the Nankai Trough, given the intermediate organic carbon content of the SAT sites.   
• Microbial community structure and diversity depend on the starter community (and hence sediment age) rather than subsequent selection driven by burial or chemical zonation.   
• Crustal biomass decreases with increasing basement age, and communication between the sedimentary and crustal biosphere ceases within $20\,\mathrm{My}$ .   
• Microbial diversity increases within subseafloor basalts with basement age as previously demonstrated in basalts exposed on the seafloor (Lee et al., 2015; Santelli et al., 2009).  

# 4.3. Objective 3 (secondary): investigate the responses of Atlantic Ocean circulation patterns and the Earth’s climate system to rapid climate change including elevated atmospheric $\mathbf{co}_{2}$ during the Cenozoic  

# 4.3.1. Scientific justification  

Climate change due to increased atmospheric $C O_{2}$ poses significant and imminent threats t o global society and the environment. Knowledge of past ocean circulation patterns and temperatures is required to assess the efficacy of numerical models in simulating intervals of high $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ . High $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ intervals are often characterized by relatively shallow lysocline and calcite compensation depths (CCDs) resulting in poor preservation of $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ microfossils used to reconstruct paleoceanographic records. This problem can be overcome by coring sediment deposited on basemen t slightly older than the targeted sediment age that accumulated prior to thermal subsidence of th e seafloor below the CCD. More continuous composite stratigraphic sequences are obtained b y drilling multiple sites along a crustal age transect, a strategy successfully employed during OD P Leg 199 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002) and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditio n 320/321 (Pälike et al., 2012). The Walvis Ridge depth transect sampled during ODP Leg 20 8 demonstrated the dynamic nature of the Cenozoic CCD and lysocline in the southeastern Atlanti c (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004) and the value of redrilling previous transects to collect mor e complete records of Earth’s history. Although spot cored, Leg 3 sites demonstrate moderate t o excellent carbonate preservation along the SAT (Scientific Party, 1970) and the location’s suitability for high-resolution paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic reconstructions through key interval s of rapid climate change (Cramer et al., 2009; Zachos et al., 2001, 2008), including the PETM an d other short-lived hyperthermals, early and middle Eocene climatic optima, the onset of Antarcti c glaciation across the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (Oi1 event), multiple Oligocene and Miocen e glaciation events (Oi and Mi events), the Miocene climatic optimum and Monterey Carbon Excursion, Pliocene warmth, and the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation.  

Global ocean circulation transfers heat and nutrients around the globe, both influencing an d responding to changes in Earth’s climate system (Broecker, 1991; Stommel, 1961; Wunsch, 2002). Fortuitously, the western intensification of ocean currents means we can substantially reconstruc t deepwater mass properties and thus thermohaline circulation history by characterizing wester n portions of major ocean basins using drilling transects. The western South Atlantic is the mai n northward flow path of Antarctic Bottom Water and southward flow path of North Atlantic Dee p Water and their precursor water masses. Consequently, the SAT cores will provide complementary data needed to constrain the evolution of thermohaline circulation patterns and climat e change as the Drake Passage and Southern Ocean opened, the northern North Atlantic deepwate r gateway opened, and the Tethys Ocean became restricted to thermohaline circulation. In particular, these cores will assist in establishing how high-latitude sea surface (and hence deep ocean ) temperatures and the CCD varied in response to $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ changes and ocean acidification (Barke r and Thomas, 2004; Barrera et al., 1997; Billups, 2002; Bohaty et al., 2009; Cramer et al., 2009; Fran k and Arthur, 1999; Kennett and Stott, 1991; Scher and Martin, 2006; Thomas et al., 2003; Wright e t al., 1991, 1992). The SAT will yield a complementary record to western North Atlantic sediment s (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 342; Norris et al., 2014), and together these dat a will provide an exceptional record of the evolution of Atlantic overturning circulation through th e Cenozoic.  

A novel, direct way to compare paleoceanographic reconstructions of past high $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ to moder n conditions is to recover sediments along transects of water column data collected by the Worl d Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The SAT constitutes a “paleo-WOCE” line following th e western portion of WOCE Line A10 (Figure F1), providing access to paleoceanographic records o f southern and northern-sourced deep and bottom waters. We will test models of bipolar deepwate r evolution (e.g., Borrelli et al., 2014; Cramer et al., 2009; Katz et al., 2011; Tripati et al., 2005) usin g stable and radiogenic isotope analyses of sediments recovered from these key western Sout h Atlantic sites.  

The Walvis Ridge depth transect (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004) revealed a dramatic $2\tan{\mathsf{C C D}}$ shoaling during the PETM due to the acidification of the ocean from massive carbon addition followed by a gradual recovery (Zachos et al., 2005; Zeebe et al., 2008). Given chemical weatherin g feedbacks, the recovery of the CCD should have resulted in a transient overdeepening of the CC D (Dickens et al., 1997). Collectively, the SAT sites will provide additional data for reconstructin g changes in the position of the lysocline and CCD in the western South Atlantic that are essentia l for constraining the timing of gateway events and the history of Northern Component Water an d Southern Component Water, which were the precursors to North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water, and the nature of Atlantic basin responses to climate change relative to th e Pacific.  

# 4.3.2. Expected outcomes  

Microfossils provide a critical archive of ocean and climate history, including long-term change s (e.g., early Eocene warmth, Cenozoic cooling, and Pliocene warmth) and abrupt events (e.g., earl y Paleogene hyperthermals and multiple glaciation events). Complete sedimentary sections recovered along paleo-WOCE Line A10 will exploit thermal subsidence of the ocean crust along th e transect to provide material for high-resolution proxy records including benthic and planktoni c foraminiferal geochemistry, micropaleontological assemblages, orbitally tuned age models, neodymium isotopes, and alkenone $\delta^{13}C$ and boron isotope $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ reconstructions with the followin g aims:  

• To reconstruct the evolution of deepwater masses over the past 61 My to assess contributions of Northern Component Water and Southern Component Water in the early Paleogene western South Atlantic (Kennett and Stott, 1990) and to document the influence of the openings of the Drake and Tasman Passages on South Atlantic deepwater circulation;   
• To provide high-resolution constraints on CCD and carbonate chemistry changes of the deep western Atlantic, particularly during transient hyperthermals and other intervals of global warmth;   
• To reconstruct the Cenozoic history of the South Atlantic subtropical gyre by monitoring proxies of productivity and paleobiogeography of oceanic plankton, rates of speciation/extinction relative to those of the equatorial zone and higher latitudes, and changes in biodiversity and subtropical ecosystem dynamics; and   
• To evaluate the response of subtropical planktonic and benthic biota to changing environmental conditions such as global warming, ocean acidification, or fertility patterns during intervals of rapid climate change through the Cenozoic.  

Drilling at these sites will also allow us to test the following hypotheses:  

• Low-latitude sites were potential sources of deepwater formation at times of global warmth and high atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ .   
• The strength of the coupling between the climate and the carbon cycle varied through the Cenozoic.   
• The lysocline and CCD responded differently on the western side of the MAR compared to the Walvis Ridge record due to changing deep/bottom water sources, gateway configurations, and flow paths.   
• The subtropical gyre cut off the delivery of heat to Antarctica as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current developed through the late Eocene–Oligocene.

# 5.1. Beginning of expedition and transit  

Expedition 395E (Complete South Atlantic Transect Reentry Systems) started in Cape Town, South Africa, at $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{(UTC+2\,h)}$ on 6 April 2021. There was no science party on the ship durin g Expedition 395E because of COVID pandemic travel restrictions and safety concerns. JRSO personnel had arrived in Cape Town on 1 April to quarantine in the hotel for 7 days prior to boarding. They took COVID-19 tests on 4 and 7 April, and these tests returned negative results, enabling th e JRSO personnel to board the R/V JOIDES Resolution on 8 April.  

However, three of the Siem Offshore crew tested positive for COVID-19 in the hotel, so they an d their 14 close contacts quarantined longer than originally planned. The extra quarantine tim e meant that the ship was not able to depart as originally scheduled on 11 April. These crew members were tested again on 11 April and the results came back negative for the close contacts. On 1 3 April, an additional round of testing of all shipboard personnel was conducted dockside, wit h everybody testing negative. The 14 close-contact crew members boarded JOIDES Resolution earl y on 15 April. The three original cases were not allowed to join the ship and returned home at th e earliest opportunity.  

During the port call, the fiber-optic pigtail on the vibration isolated television subsea camera wa s upgraded by a contractor (a former IODP staff member), and the job was completed by 11 April.  

The harbor pilot boarded the vessel at $0922\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 15 April, and the last dock line was released a t $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ . The pilot was away at $1026\,\mathrm{h}$ and the sea voyage started at $1100\,\mathrm{h}$ (Figures F6, F7). Shipboard personnel wore masks and followed social distancing protocols during the 14 day COVID

19 mitigation period following the departure of the pilot. During the transit, the ship’s clock wa s set back $2\;\mathrm{h},$ putting the ship at $\mathrm{UTC}+0$ , or $^{5\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ ahead of College Station, Texas. The ship staye d on that time until the end of the expedition in Reykjavík, Iceland.  

We arrived at Site U1560 at $0108\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 April, completing the $1817\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Cape Tow n in $161.3~\mathrm{h}$ (6.7 days) at an average speed of $11.3\mathrm{~kt}$ . The thrusters were lowered, and the shi p switched to dynamic positioning (DP) mode at $0215\,\mathrm{h}$ , starting operations for Site U1560.  

# 5.2. Site U1560  

# 5.2.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1560 (Proposed Site SATL-25A) is at $30.4^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ in the central South Atlantic Ocean, ${\sim}315~\mathrm{km}$ west of the MAR. The objective for Site U1560 during Expedition 395E was (1) to core one hol e with the APC/XCB system to basement for gas safety monitoring and to confirm the depth t o basement and (2) to install a reentry system with casing through the sediment into basement in  a second hole (Figure F8). These operations will expedite basement drilling during SAT Expedition s 390 and 393.  

Site U1560 is located on Seismic Line CREST02 at common depth point (CDP) 12770, ${\sim}400\mathrm{~m~}$ south of the CREST1E crossing line. A reflector at ${\sim}5.08$ s two-way traveltime (TWT) was interpreted to be the top of basement and estimated to be 104 mbsf (Coggon et al., 2020). Based on th e deeper-than-expected basement depths we found during Expedition 390C, we expected basemen t to be similarly deeper at Site U1560. The ocean crust at Site U1560 was estimated to have forme d at $15.2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ at a half spreading rate of $25.5\;\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}.$ . This site targets the second-youngest crust of th e SAT sites. The mineralogy and alteration extent of the basement rocks at Site U1560, changes i n physical properties such as porosity, and the composition of the microbial communities will b e compared to the same characteristics at the other sites along the transect to investigate the development of hydrothermal circulation and crustal aging. Overlying sediment at Site U1560 is primarily carbonate ooze and will be used in paleoceanographic and microbiological studies.

# 5.2.2. Operations  

# 5.2.2.1. Hole U1560A  

JOIDES Resolution completed the $1817\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1560 from Cape Town in 6.7 days at a n average speed of $11.3~\mathrm{kt}$ . We arrived at Site U1560 at $0108~\mathrm{h}$ on 22 April 2021 (Figures F6, F7), lowered the thrusters, and switched to DP mode at $0215\,\mathrm{h}$ , marking the start of operations at Sit e U1560. The APC/XCB bottom-hole assembly (BHA) was made up, and we started lowering th e drill bit to the seafloor at $0945\,\mathrm{h}$ . During the descent, the brakes on the drawworks unit were foun d to be slipping, and tripping was paused several times for adjustments. The drill string deploymen t was stopped at $1900\ \mathrm{h}$ to inspect the brakes. Everything appeared normal, except the band s appeared to be dusty. The bands were washed off and the covers reinstalled. The brakes operate d normally after this. Tripping resumed at $2250\,\mathrm{h}$ to 3708 meters below sea level (mbsl). Because thi s was the first site of the expedition, we pumped two “pigs” (pipe cleaning devices) through the dril l string to remove rust. The first APC core was shot from 3714 mbsl but returned empty, missin g the mudline, so the drill bit was lowered $5\;\mathrm{m}$ for the next attempt.  

We spudded Hole U1560A $\mathrm{(30^{\circ}24.2064^{\prime}S}$ , $16^{\circ}55.3718^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) at $0405~\mathrm{h}$ on 23 April. Mudline Cor e 395E-U1560A-1H arrived on deck at $0430\,\mathrm{h}$ and recovered $4.7\textrm{m}$ (Figure F9), establishing a seafloor depth of 3723.7 mbsl. Cores 2H–11H advanced from 4.6 to 99.7 mbsf. All APC cores wer e oriented with the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool. Formation temperature measurements wer e taken on Cores 4H and 7H with the APCT-3 tool.  

At $^{1730\,\mathrm{h}}$ , we changed to the XCB coring system because we were approaching the anticipate d basement depth. We used a PDC XCB cutting shoe that had proven successful at recovering basement material during Expedition 390C. Cores 395E-U1560A-12X through 14X advanced fro m 99.7 to 120.1 mbsf. While drilling Core 15X, a slowing in the drilling rate indicated that the basement contact was reached at 120.2 mbsf (Figure F9). Cores 15X and 16X advanced from 120.1 t o 122.5 mbsf and recovered $0.44\mathrm{~m~}(18\%)$ . Upon recovery, these two cores were confirmed to b e basalt (Figure F10). The rate of penetration in this solid formation was slow $({\sim}0.6\mathrm{~m/h)}$ , so w e stopped coring at this point. We raised the drill bit up to the ship, and it cleared the rig floor a t $1520\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 April, ending Hole U1560A. Cores 1H–16X recovered $119.08\mathrm{~m~}(97\%)$ . Total dept h for Hole U1560A was 122.5 mbsf, and total time on hole was $61.05\,\mathrm{h}$ (2.5 days).

We then prepared to install the reentry system in Hole U1560B (Figure F11). At $1745\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 Apri l 2021, we started making up the HRT BHA, followed by the $10\%$ inch casing string. We picked u p the casing with the running tool and landed it on the base of the reentry cone in the moonpool. W e then rigged up the drill pipe stinger, including a drill bit, underreamer, and mud motor, and teste d it in the moonpool. By $1300~\mathrm{h}$ on 25 April, we had lowered the stinger through the casing an d secured it to the base. We assembled the reentry cone and welded it to the base, and at $1545\,\mathrm{h}$ w e started lowering the assembly to the seafloor, reaching 3675 mbsl at $0130~\mathrm{h}$ on 26 April. W e installed the top drive and deployed the subsea camera and Conductivity-Temperature-Dept h (CTD) instrument.  

We spudded Hole U1560B $30^{\circ}56.4546^{\prime}\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $26^{\circ}37.7898^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) at $0430\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 April. A water depth o f 3723.7 mbsl was assumed, based on the mudline depth for Hole U1560A. In the subsea camer a images, Hole U1560B lies about $5\textrm{m}$ to the west-southwest of Hole U1560A. We drilled to th e target depth of 124 mbsf and disconnected the casing using the HRT at $1025\,\mathrm{h}$ . We filled the case d hole with heavy mud to prevent inflow and raised the subsea camera and CTD instrument to th e ship. We then raised the stinger assembly to the ship, and the drill bit reached the rig floor at 235 5 h and was disassembled. Wear on the bit indicated that basement was contacted, but the excellen t condition of the underreamer cutters suggests that it is unlikely that the underreamer and casin g reached basement. Therefore, the basement contact in Hole U1560B is a little deeper than in Hol e U1560A (120.2 mbsf), as a result of local basement surface topography.

Figure F11. Reentry system, Hole U1560B. mbrf $=$ meters below rig floor, mbsf $=$ meters below seafloor.  

We made up the cementing BHA and lowered it to just above the seabed. The subsea camera wa s lowered to the BHA to guide reentry, and at $1445~\mathrm{h}$ on 27 April we reentered Hole U1560B. W e positioned the base of the BHA at 3 mbsf, which was deep enough for the cup packer in the BH A to seal the top of the casing. We established circulation and pumped down 10 bbl of 15 ppg cemen t and then pulled the BHA back out of the hole, clearing the reentry cone at $1545~\mathrm{h}$ . The drill pip e was cleared of any residual cement by pumping down two pigs and flushing it with seawater. Th e subsea camera was raised back to the ship, followed by the BHA, ending operations in Hol e U1560B at $2315\ \mathrm{h}$ on 27 April. The rig floor was secured for transit at $0045~\mathrm{h}$ on 28 April. W e raised the thrusters and started the sea passage to Site U1557 at $0124\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 April, ending operations at Site U1560.  

The next site of Expedition 395E was originally planned to be Proposed Site SATL-33B, the middl e site of the SAT on $30.6\;\mathrm{Ma}$ crust. Because of the 4 day delay in leaving port, there would not hav e been enough time to complete operations at all four planned sites, so we decided to defer operations at Site SATL-33B until Expedition 390 or 393 in 2022. Instead, the next hole of Expeditio n 395E was the higher priority Hole U1557D, where Expedition 390C had installed a reentry syste m consisting of a reentry cone and $60\;\mathrm{m}$ of 16 inch casing in November 2020. This site was technically more challenging because the heavy weight of $\sim\!5\,\mathrm{km}$ of pipe and $573\;\mathrm{m}$ of casing meant tha t the installation could only take place under calm conditions. The weather forecast predicted cal m seas at Site U1557, and we decided to take advantage of that.  

# 5.2.3. Principal results  

The sediment/basement contact in Hole U1560A is a sharp transition at 120.1 mbsf. The contac t was deeper than originally estimated from seismic data $:104~\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ but similar to what wa s expected from the basement depths cored during Expedition 390C. The basement depth in case d Hole U1560B is slightly deeper than in Hole U1560A, but the exact depth in Hole U1560B remain s to be determined by drilling and logging during Expedition 390 or 393.  

Cores 395E-U1560A-1H through 14X were measured on the WR and split-core track systems. Cores 15X and 16X were measured on the WR tracks but were not split and were preserved i n nitrogen gas–flushed bags for description and analysis during Expeditions 390 and 393. Cor e catcher samples from Cores 1H through 13X were collected for postexpedition biostratigraphi c dating. In addition, we collected one sample per core for headspace gas analysis as well as 1 or  2 WR samples per core for chemical analysis of IW. The squeezed sediments from the IW sample s were measured on the carbonate coulometer and X-ray diffraction (XRD) instruments. No systematic core description took place during Expedition 395E.  

The sediment is predominantly carbonate ooze (Figure F9) that ranges from 81 to $95\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ calciu m carbonate. Generally low values of magnetic susceptibility and natural gamma radiation (NGR ) reflect the low terrigenous content of the carbonate ooze, and $10\,\mathrm{m}$ to submeter-scale variations i n these physical property values likely reflect variations in terrigenous sediment content. Paleomagnetic reversals are evident in the superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) data, and a preliminary assessment of the reversal stratigraphy suggests that sedimentation is most probabl y continuous at this site since the crust formed ${\sim}15\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . It is likely that a robust magnetostratigraph y can be constructed after further holes are cored during Expedition 390 or 393 and a complet e splice is available.  

Preliminary analysis of the IW chemistry data shows that sulfate has a flat profile, varying betwee n 27.4 and $28.8\;\mathrm{mM}$ . Ammonium has more variability, ranging from $3\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ near the top of the hole t o $40\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ near its base. Most dissolved element profiles have some downhole structure but over narrow concentration ranges; for example, magnesium varies between 49.7 and $52.5\;\mathrm{mM}$ . Headspac e methane measurements were all below the detection limit. These results suggest that diageneti c processes at Site U1560 are slow, which is consistent with this site’s open-ocean location and lo w organic matter input.  

# 5.3. Site U1557  

# 5.3.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1557 (proposed Site SATL-56A) was started during SAT Expedition 390C in Novembe r 2020. Site U1557 was cored to basement in Hole U1557B, and a reentry system consisting of  a reentry cone and $60\textrm{m}$ of 16 inch casing was installed in Hole U1557D (Estes et al., 2021). Th e objective for Expedition 395E was to complete the reentry system in Hole U1557D by installing  a second, nested $10\%$ inch casing string down to basement. This engineering work will expedit e basement drilling during SAT Expeditions 390 and 393.  

Site U1557 is in the central South Atlantic Ocean at $31^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ at a water depth of $5010.7\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , ${\sim}1250\ \mathrm{km}$ west of the MAR. It lies on Seismic Line CREST1A/B at CDP 4470 near the CREST05 crossing lin e (Figure F4) (Coggon et al., 2020). A reflector at ${\sim}7.2$ s TWT was interpreted to be the top of basement, and the sediment–basement transition was found at 564 mbsf in Hole U1557B. This site i s located $6.7\,\mathrm{km}$ from Site U1556, and the ocean crust at both sites is estimated to have formed a t ${\sim}61.2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ at a half spreading rate of ${\sim}13.5\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ . Ocean crust at these sites is the oldest that will b e drilled along the SAT and will be compared to younger crustal material from the sites to the east, closer to the MAR. The sedimentary succession at Site U1557 is about twice as thick as at Sit e U1556. Contrasts between these closely spaced sites will allow exploration of the blanketing effec t of sediment thickness on hydrothermal circulation and crustal evolution. The sediments at Sit e U1557 consist of calcareous ooze and hemipelagic clays and will be used in paleoceanographic an d microbiological studies. The thick succession at Site U1557 will allow development of paleoceanographic records covering the entire Cenozoic, including reconstruction of Atlantic Ocean circulation patterns during periods of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide.  

# 5.3.2. Operations  

# 5.3.2.1. Hole U1557D  

The ship transited $502\ \mathrm{nmi}$ from Site U1560 to Site U1557 in $44\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at an average speed of $11.4\;\mathrm{kt},$ arriving at Hole U1557D $(30^{\circ}56.4546^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $26^{\circ}37.7898^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) at $2130~\mathrm{h}$ on 29 April 2021 (Figures F6, F7). The thrusters were lowered, and the ship switched to DP mode at $2215\,\mathrm{h}$ . The plan was to firs t deepen Hole U1557D from the depth of the existing 16 inch casing shoe (60 mbsf) to $10\;\mathrm{m}$ int o basement in preparation for installing the $10\%$ inch casing string using a Dril-Quip running tool i n a separate run (Figure F12). We used this two-stage method because the water depth (5010. 7 mbsl) and casing depth $^{\prime}{\sim}573~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) at Site U1557 meant that a mud motor stinger and HR T assembly, used in Hole U1560B, would be too heavy to deploy safely.  

The $14\%$ inch drilling BHA was assembled at $0230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 April, and we ran it down to $4980\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ by $1100~\mathrm{h}$ . We then deployed the subsea camera and CTD instrument. The camera worked well, confirming that the upgrade to the fiber-optic pigtail connection that had been made during th e port call was successful (the connection had failed in these water depths during Expedition 390C). We picked up the top drive and reentered Hole U1557D at $1600\ \mathrm{h},$ retrieved the subsea camer a and CTD instrument, and brought them back on board at $1815\,\mathrm{h}$ . At $1830\,\mathrm{h}$ , we started lowerin g the BHA into the cased part of the existing hole, taking weight at 60 mbsf at $1930\,\mathrm{h}$ . Over the nex t $37\,\mathrm{{h}}$ we drilled down, and we reached the sediment/basement contact at 566.6 mbsf at $0830\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 2 May. This compares to a basement depth of 564 mbsf in Hole U1557B. It took another $7.5~\mathrm{h}$ t o reach the target depth of 576.6 mbsf (Figure F8). We then swept the hole of cuttings by pumpin g 50 bbl of high-viscosity mud. Next, we made a wiper trip to clear the hole of obstructions and infill. We racked back the top drive and raised the drill bit to the base of the 16 inch casing $(60~\mathrm{mbsf})$ , and then lowered the drill bit back down to 524.1 mbsf. At that point, we reinstalled the top driv e and rotated the drill bit down, encountered infill at 568.1 mbsf, and then washed it out to the tota l hole depth of 576.6 mbsf. We made another sweep of the hole with $50\;\mathrm{bbl}$ of high-viscosity mud, and then filled the hole with $12\,\mathrm{ppg}$ heavy mud to help reduce any caving of the borehole walls. O n 3 May, we pulled the drill bit out of the hole, clearing the seafloor at $0315\,\mathrm{h}$ and reaching the ri g floor at $1430~\mathrm{h}$ . We assembled the casing running tool and set it aside in the derrick and the n assembled the casing string, which took the remainder of the day. On 4 May, we lowered the casin g string to $4978~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , and at $1000~\mathrm{h}$ we started to lower the subsea camera. We reentered Hol e U1557D at $1245~\mathrm{h}$ and lowered the casing string to 554 mbsf. At that depth, we engaged the to p drive to allow rotation, if required, and continued lowering the casing to its full depth of 571. 6 mbsf at $1535\,\mathrm{h}$ , landing the top of the casing in the existing reentry cone. There was no circulatio n in the hole while pumping, showing that the formation had sealed around the casing and that th e base of the casing would not need to be cemented. We released the casing from the Dril-Qui p running tool and cleared the reentry cone at $1600\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

Starting at $1645~\mathrm{h}$ on 4 May, JOIDES Resolution moved from Hole U1557D to Site U1556 in D P mode, traveling $3.6\;\mathrm{nmi}$ in $12.5\,\mathrm{h}$ at an average speed of $0.3\,\mathrm{kt}$ . During this slow transit, the subse a camera was brought back aboard at $1830\,\mathrm{h}$ . We raised the BHA and the Dril-Quip casing runnin g tool and then disassembled it by $0630~\mathrm{h}$ on 5 May, officially ending operations in Hole U1557D. We arrived at Site U1556 at 0715 h on 5 May.  

# 5.3.3. Principal results  

The sediment/basement contact in Hole U1557D is at 566.6 mbsf, based on the abrupt reductio n in drilling rate at that depth. This is $2.6~\mathrm{m}$ deeper that the basement depth of 564 mbsf in Hol e U1557B. The difference can be attributed to normal local variations in basement surface topography.  

No material was cored in Hole U1557D during Expedition 395E. A basic description of the core s from Hole U1557B, cored during Expedition 390C, is available in the Expedition 390C Preliminar y Report (Estes et al., 2021).  

Additional analyses and data interpretations will occur during Expeditions 390 and 393, which ar e scheduled to take place in 2022.

# 5.4. Site U1556  

# 5.4.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1556 (proposed Site SATL-53B) started during SAT Expedition 390C in October 2020, whe n Hole U1556A was cored to basement (Estes et al., 2021). The objective for Expedition 395E was t o drill and install a $10\%$ inch reentry system with casing to basement in Hole U1556B. These operations will expedite basement drilling during SAT Expeditions 390 and 393.  

Site U1556 is in the central South Atlantic Ocean at $30.6^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ at a water depth of $5006\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , ${\sim}1250\ \mathrm{km}$ west of the MAR. It lies on Seismic Line CREST1A/B at CDP 3410 near the CREST05 crossing lin e (Figure F4) (Coggon et al., 2020). A reflector at ${\sim}6.9\;s$ TWT was interpreted to be the top of basement and was found at 278 mbsf in Hole U1556A. This site is located $6.7\,\mathrm{km}$ west of Site U1557, and the basement at both sites is predicted to have formed at ${\sim}61.2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ at a half spreading rate o f ${\sim}13.5\ \mathrm{mm/y}$ . Oceanic crust at these sites is the oldest that will be drilled during the SAT expeditions. The mineralogy and extent of alteration of the basement rocks at Site U1556, changes i n physical properties such as porosity, and the composition of the microbial communities will b e compared to the same characteristics at the other sites along the transect to investigate the development of hydrothermal circulation and crustal aging. The sedimentary succession at Site U155 6 is about half as thick as at Site U1557, and contrasts between these closely spaced sites will allo w exploration of the blanketing effect of sediment thickness on hydrothermal circulation. Sedimen t in Hole U1556A alternates between $1{-}10\ \mathrm{m}$ thick layers of red-brown clay and carbonate ooz e with sharp contacts between these lithologies (Estes et al., 2021) and will be used in paleoceanographic and microbiological studies.  

# 5.4.2. Operations  

# 5.4.2.1. Hole U1556B  

We arrived at Site U1556 at $0715~\mathrm{h}$ on 5 May 2021 after moving from Site U1557 in DP mod e (Figures F6, F7). In preparation for installing the reentry system in Hole U1556B (Figure F13), w e made up the HRT and set it aside in the derrick. We then assembled $284.2~\mathrm{m}$ of $10\%$ inch casin g and landed it on the base of the reentry cone in the moonpool. From 1700 to $2215\,\mathrm{h}$ , we assemble d the stinger (comprising a $9\%$ inch bit, underreamer, and mud motor), tested it in the moonpool, and lowered it down through the casing. The same assembly had been used to drill Hole U1560 B earlier during the expedition. The HRT running tool was attached and bolted to the base of th e reentry cone, and the reentry cone was welded to the base. At $0230~\mathrm{h}$ on 6 May, we lowered th e assembly through the moonpool and started the pipe trip to 4994 mbsl. At $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ , we started t o lower the subsea camera.  

We started Hole U1556B $30^{\circ}56.5244^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $26^{\circ}41.9472^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) at $1655\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 May, and by $2000\,\mathrm{h}$ we ha d drilled in the casing to 75.5 mbsf. During this operation, the cable to the subsea camera ha d wrapped around the drill pipe eight times, which is more than usual, so we paused drilling an d slowly raised the subsea camera to the ship. It was back on board at $2245\,\mathrm{h}$ . We resumed drilling, and at $1530\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 May at an apparent depth of $282.3\,\mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , the weight of the casing was no longe r held by the drill string, indicating that the reentry cone had landed on the seafloor at a shallowe r depth than the expected 286.2 mbsf. At $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ , we released the casing from the HRT. We filled th e hole with $75\,\mathrm{bbl}$ of heavy mud and raised the drill bit, clearing the seafloor at $1920\,\mathrm{h}$ . From 0245 t o $1200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 May, we disassembled the bit, underreamer, and mud motor and then assembled th e BHA for cementing.  

After stowing the casing deployment equipment, we lowered the cementing BHA to 4922 mbsl. The next operation was to deploy the subsea camera to guide reentry into Hole U1556B. However, rough weather with ${\sim}4\;\mathrm{m}$ heave made it unsafe to launch the camera (at a water depth of $5000\;\mathrm{m}$ the camera’s umbilical cable has a fatigue operating limit of ${\sim}2.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of heave), so we waited for th e seas to subside. At $0945~\mathrm{h}$ on $10\;\mathrm{May}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , the seas had calmed enough to deploy the subsea camera. We observed that the top of the reentry cone was level with the seafloor (Figure F13) and tagged i t to determine a water depth of 5001.8 mbsl for Hole U1556B. This depth is $4.6\,\mathrm{m}$ shallower than th e mudline depth for Hole U1556A, which explains why the casing in Hole U1556B landed at a shallower depth than expected. Based on the water depth, the depth of Hole U1556B was revised t o $286.2\ \mathrm{mbsf}$ , with the $10\%$ inch casing shoe at 284.2 mbsf. As a result of the shallower-thanexpected seafloor, Hole U1556B came close to but did not reach the sediment/basement contact.

At $1225\ \mathrm{h}$ on 10 May we reentered Hole U1556B with the cementing BHA. A circulation tes t showed that the formation had sealed around the casing, so there was no need to cement the bas e of the hole. We raised the BHA, which cleared the seafloor at $1240~\mathrm{h}$ and reached the rig floor a t $2359\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending operations in Hole U1556B.  

# 5.4.3. Principal results  

Expedition 395E did not retrieve core material from Hole U1556B, but a description of the principal results from Hole U1556A, cored during Expedition 390C, are described in the Expeditio n 390C Preliminary Report (Estes et al., 2021). Additional analyses and data interpretation will tak e place during Expeditions 390 and 393, which are scheduled to take place in 2022.  

# 5.5. Site U1561  

# 5.5.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1561 (proposed Site SATL-55A) is in the central South Atlantic Ocean at $30.4^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , ${\sim}1250\ \mathrm{km}$ west of the MAR. It lies on Seismic Line CREST05 at CDP 16750 (Figures F1, F4). A reflector a t ${\sim}6.56\$ s TWT was interpreted to be the top of basement at 126 mbsf (Coggon et al., 2020). This sit e is located $13\;\mathrm{nmi}$ north of Site U1556, and the basement at both sites is predicted to have forme d at ${\sim}61.2\ \mathrm{Ma}$ at a half spreading rate of ${\sim}13.5~\mathrm{mm/y}$ . Oceanic crust at these sites is the oldest tha t will be drilled during SAT Expeditions 390 and 393.  

After completing reentry system installations in Holes U1560B, U1557D, and U1556B for the SAT, ${\sim}2.5$ days of operations time remained during Expedition 395E before we had to depart for Reykjavík on 14 May. In consultation with the Expedition 390/393 Co-Chief Scientists, it was decide d to use this time to core a single hole at nearby alternate Site SATL-55A (U1561). The sedimentar y succession at Site U1561 was expected to be thinner than at nearby Sites U1556 and U1557 an d would provide information on sediment accumulation patterns and pore water chemical profile s of this local area.  

# 5.5.2. Operations  

# 5.5.2.1. Hole U1561A  

After completing the $13\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1556, we arrived at Site U1561 at $0324\,\mathrm{h}$ on 11 Ma y 2021 (Figures F6, F7). We lowered the thrusters and entered DP mode at $0349\,\mathrm{h}$ . The APC/XC B BHA was made up and lowered to the seafloor. Based on the seafloor reflection in the seismi c profile, the water depth at Site U1561 was expected to be 4857 mbsl (Coggon et al., 2020). As w e arrived on site, the precision depth recorder (PDR) $3.5~\mathrm{kHz}$ signal malfunctioned and the dept h reading had to be taken with the $12.5\;\mathrm{kHz}$ signal instead, which gave an apparent water depth o f 4963 mbsl ( $106\,\mathrm{~m~}$ deeper than the depth in the Scientific Prospectus [Coggon et al., 2020]). Because of this discrepancy, below 4857 mbsl we slowed the descent of the drill bit and monitore d the weight of the drill string. The drill string took noticeable weight at 4927 mbsl, indicating tha t the BHA was partly supported by the formation. We raised the drill bit to 4917 mbsl to attempt  a mudline core, which returned full, showing that the seafloor was shallower than 4917 mbsl. W e raised the drill bit by a further $5\;\mathrm{m}$ to 4912 mbsl for a second attempt, but this core was also ful l and did not recover a mudline. These two cores were later designated to be Cores 395E-U1561B1H and 395E-U1561C-1H, respectively. The drill bit was raised to 4907 mbsl for a third attempt.  

Hole U1561A $(30^{\circ}43.2902^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $026^{\circ}41.7162^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) was spudded at $2335\,\mathrm{h}$ on 11 May, and Core 395EU1561A-1H recovered $6.7\,\mathrm{m}$ , establishing a seafloor depth of 4909.5 mbsl. On 12 May, Cores $2\mathrm{H}-$ 6H advanced from 6.7 to 46.2 mbsf (Figures F8, F9). Core 6H struck hard rock, which bent th e APC cutting shoe. We switched to the XCB system, and Cores 7X–9X advanced from 46.2 to 48. 9 mbsf (Core 7X was empty). Core 9X took $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ to advance $1.2\;\mathrm{m},$ , recovering $1.18\;\mathrm{m}$ of basalt (Figur e F10). The slow rate of penetration was partly caused by the BHA being mostly above the seafloor, limiting the weight that could be applied safely. Cores 1H–9X recovered $45.4~\mathrm{m}$ $(93\%)$ . At $2245\,\mathrm{h}$ , we stopped coring to prepare for the transit to Reykjavík. We raised the drill bit, clearing the seafloor at $2355~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 May and reaching the rig floor at $1150~\mathrm{h}$ on 13 May, ending operations i n Hole U1561A.  

From 1230 to $1730~\mathrm{h}$ , we deployed the subsea camera to $4881~\mathrm{mbsl}_{\cdot}$ , without the drill pipe, t o detorque the camera’s umbilical cable. This was done because the cable had wrapped around th e drill pipe up to eight times during a deployment at Site U1556, and any residual twisting coul d damage the cable. While the camera was being lowered and raised back, the ship was secured fo r transit. We raised the thrusters, and at $1806\,\mathrm{h}$ we began the sea passage to Reykjavík. The transi t took 22.6 days at an average speed of 10.6 kt.  

# 5.5.3. Principal results  

The sediment/basalt contact in Hole U1561A is at $46.2\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , and it is a sharp transition. We di d not expect to reach basalt at 46.2 mbsf because the main basement seismic reflector is at ${\sim}126$ mbsf at this site location, as estimated from seismic data. We do not yet know the reason for thi s discrepancy, nor for the differing estimates of seafloor depth between the seabed seismic reflection (4857 mbsl), the $12.5\,\mathrm{kHz}$ PDR reflection $(4963.1\,\mathrm{mbsl})$ ), and the mudline depth $(4909.5\,\mathrm{mbsl})$ ).  

Cores 395E-U1561A-1H through 9X were measured on the WR and split-core track systems. Sections from Cores 8X and 9X, containing basalt (Figure F10), were measured on the WR tracks bu t were not split and were instead preserved in nitrogen gas–flushed bags for description and analysis during Expeditions 390 and 393. Core catcher samples from Cores 1H–6H were collected fo r postexpedition biostratigraphic dating. We collected one sample per core for headspace gas analysis as well as 1 or 2 WR samples per core for chemical analysis of IW. The squeezed sediment s from the IW samples were measured on the carbonate coulometer and XRD instruments. No systematic core description took place during Expedition 395E.  

The sediment is red-brown clay from the seafloor to 22.5 mbsf ( $1\%$ calcium carbonate) and carbonate ooze from 22.5 to 46.2 mbsf $\langle81{-}90~\mathrm{wt}\%$ calcium carbonate) (Figure F9). This change i n lithology is reflected in the magnetic susceptibility and NGR data, which shift from relatively hig h values above 22.5 mbsf to lower values below as a result of the higher contents of terrigenous sediment in the red-brown clay. Some paleomagnetic reversals are evident in the SRM data, but not a s many as would be expected if sediment had been continuously deposited at this site since the crus t formed ${\sim}61.2~\mathrm{Ma}$ , indicating that there are discontinuities or intervals of condensed sedimentation in the succession.  

Preliminary analysis of the IW chemistry data shows that sulfate decreases slightly from $29.6\;\mathrm{mM}$ in the top core sample to ${\sim}26.5\,\mathrm{mM}$ for samples below ${\sim}20$ mbsf. Ammonium has more variability, ranging from $12\ \upmu\mathrm{M}$ in the top sample to $62\ \upmu\mathrm{M}$ deeper in the hole. Most dissolved element profiles have some downhole structure but over narrow concentration ranges; for example, magnesium varies between $52.7\;\mathrm{mM}$ in the shallowest sample to $48.5\;\mathrm{mM}$ in the deepest sample. Thes e results suggest that diagenetic processes at Site U1561 are slow, which is consistent with this site’ s open-ocean location and low organic matter input.  

# 5.6. Transit and end of expedition  

The transit north to Reykjavík began on 13 May 2021 at $1806~\mathrm{h}$ and ended on 5 June at $0700~\mathrm{h}$ when the pilot boarded (Figures F6, F7). The transit took 22.6 days at an average speed of 10.6 kt. The first line was ashore at $0818\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 May, marking the end of Expedition 395E and the start o f Expedition 395C.  

# 6. Preliminary scientific assessment  

The primary goal of Expedition 395E was to complete casing and reentry system installations fo r the South Atlantic Transect that were started during Expedition 390C and in preparation fo r Expeditions 390 and 393. Secondary goals included coring the sediment column and a few meter s into basement with the APC/XCB coring system and analyzing cored material for ephemera l properties. Site U1560 was the first site of the expedition on the second-youngest crust $({\sim}15.2\,\mathrm{Ma})$ of the transect, where we cored to basement and installed a reentry system. The operations pla n was then adjusted to omit operations at Site SATL-33B, the site located on $30.6\,\mathrm{Ma}$ crust, becaus e the expedition lost operations time when the ship departed from Cape Town, South Africa, 4 day s later than planned and because calm sea states were forecast for Site U1557, which were essentia l for casing installation at that deepwater site. After completing the reentry systems at Sites U155 7 and U1556, 2.5 days remained before the ship had to begin the transit to Iceland, and we used thi s time to core to basement at nearby alternate Site U1561. With the long transits, Expedition 395 E had ${\sim}20$ days of operational time along the SAT (Figures F6, F7; Table T2). Figure F8 shows wor k completed at SAT sites in addition to the remaining operational objectives to be accomplishe d during future SAT expeditions.  

# 6.1. Operational considerations  

During Expedition 390C, we found that it was not possible to release casing with the Dril-Qui p system when the casing shoe was in basement rocks in Holes U1558B and U1558C, but the syste m released casing without difficulty when the casing shoe was positioned in sediment in Hole s U1557D, U1558D, and U1559B. After Expedition 390C, it was recommended that for futur e endeavors involving installation of casing into basement, either a HRT reentry system should b e used or the hole should be fully drilled out beyond the intended depth of the casing shoe prior t o casing installation. Installing the casing shoe in basement is desirable because it helps to make  a more stable hole for deep drilling where the top of basement is rubbly and unstable. Also, whe n the base of casing is in sediment and a lot of drilling fluid is pumped to remove cuttings, a washou t can develop, which can make it difficult to run logging tools into basement. For these reasons, w e aimed to case into basement during Expedition 395E.  

We used a HRT to release casing in Holes U1560B and U1556B during Expedition 395E. In Hol e U1557D, the reentry cone and $60\;\mathrm{m}$ of 16 inch casing installed during Expedition 390C was compatible with Dril-Quip but not HRT, so this hole was first drilled out to $10\,\mathrm{m}$ into basement with  a 14 inch bit, and then the $10\%$ inch casing was deployed to $5\,\mathrm{m}$ into basement without problems. I n Hole U1560B, although we drilled to $2~\mathrm{m}$ below the anticipated depth to basement, based on th e depth it was found during coring operations in Hole U1560A, local seafloor topography mean t that the casing shoe remained a small height (probably less than ${\sim}2~\mathrm{m}$ ) above basement. The ga p between casing and basement was likely to have been filled when the bottom of casing wa s cemented.  

In the cored holes at Sites U1560 and U1561, the XCB coring system with a PDC cutting shoe wa s used to advance $2{-}3\textrm{m}$ into basalt. Similar to Expedition 390C, the PDC cutting shoe again performed very well.  

In Hole U1561A, there were large differences between the anticipated and the actual seafloor an d basement depths. The seafloor depth of $4909.5\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ (mudline) was $52.5\;\mathrm{m}$ deeper than the dept h based on the seabed seismic reflection $(4857\;\mathrm{mbsl})$ , and $53.6\;\mathrm{m}$ shallower than the depth based o n the $12.5\;\mathrm{kHz}$ PDR reflection $(4963.1\,\mathrm{mbsl})$ ). Basalt was encountered at 46.2 mbsf in Hole U1561A, compared to the basement seismic reflector at ${\sim}126$ mbsf at this site location.

# 6.2. Preliminary assessment of scientific objectives  

Sediment and basalt were recovered at Sites U1560 and U1561 during Expedition 395E. Preliminary assessment of these cores was limited because no scientists were aboard, and the cores will b e returned to JOIDES Resolution for visual core description during Expeditions 390 and 393. However, core images and physical property, paleomagnetic, and pore water geochemical data wer e collected during Expedition 395E and are briefly described here.  

Site U1560 lies on $15.2\;\mathrm{Ma}$ crust at a water depth of $3723.7\mathrm{~m~}$ . The sediment is predominantl y carbonate ooze (Figure F9) that ranges from 81 to $95\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ calcium carbonate. Generally low value s of magnetic susceptibility and NGR reflect the low terrigenous content of the carbonate ooze, an d $^{10\textrm{m}}$ to submeter-scale variations in these physical property values reflect variations in terrigenous sediment content. Paleomagnetic reversals are evident in the SRM data, and a preliminar y assessment of the reversal stratigraphy suggests that sedimentation was near-continuous at thi s site after the crust formed ${\sim}15~\mathrm{Ma}$ . The magnetostratigraphic record will be refined after dat a from further holes are combined to make a complete stratigraphic splice during Expedition 390 o r 393.  

The sediment/basement contact in Hole U1560A is a sharp transition at 120.1 mbsf. The contac t was deeper than originally estimated from seismic data $\mathrm{[104~mbsf)}$ but similar to what wa s expected from the basement depths cored during Expedition 390C. The basement depth in case d Hole U1560B is slightly deeper than in Hole U1560A, but the exact depth in Hole U1560B remain s to be determined by drilling and logging during Expedition 390 or 393.  

Preliminary analysis of IW chemistry data shows that sulfate has a flat profile, varying betwee n 27.4 and $28.8\;\mathrm{mM}$ . Ammonium has more variability, ranging from $3\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ near the top of the hole t o $40\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ near its base. Most dissolved element profiles have some downhole structure but over narrow concentration ranges; for example, magnesium varies between 49.7 and $52.5\;\mathrm{mM}$ . Headspac e methane measurements were all below the detection limit. These results suggest that diageneti c processes at Site U1560 are slow, which is consistent with this site’s open-ocean location and lo w organic matter input.  

Site U1561 lies on ${\sim}61.2\ \mathrm{Ma}$ crust at a water depth of $4909.5\mathrm{~m~}$ . The sediment is red-brown cla y from the seafloor to 22.5 mbsf ( ${<}1\%$ calcium carbonate) and carbonate ooze from 22.5 to $46.2\,\mathrm{mbsf}$ $(81{-}90\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ calcium carbonate) (Figure F9). This change in lithology is reflected in the magneti c susceptibility and NGR data, which shift from relatively high values above 22.5 mbsf to lower values below as a result of the higher contents of terrigenous sediment in the red-brown clay. Som e paleomagnetic reversals are evident in the SRM data, but not as many as would be expected i f sediment had been continuously deposited at this site since the crust formed ${\sim}61.2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , indicatin g that there are discontinuities or intervals of condensed sedimentation in the succession.  

The sediment/basalt contact in Hole U1561A is at $46.2\ \mathrm{mbsf},$ and it is a sharp transition. We di d not expect to reach basalt at 46.2 mbsf because the main basement seismic reflector is at ${\sim}126$ mbsf at this site location, as estimated from seismic data. We do not yet know the reason for thi s discrepancy, nor for the differing estimates of seafloor depth between the seabed seismic reflection (4857 mbsl), the $12.5\,\mathrm{kHz}$ PDR reflection $(4963.1\,\mathrm{mbsl})$ , and the mudline depth $(4909.5\,\mathrm{mbsl})$ ).  

Preliminary analysis of the IW chemistry data shows that sulfate decreases slightly from $29.6\;\mathrm{mM}$ in the top core sample to ${\sim}26.5~\mathrm{mM}$ for the samples below ${\sim}20$ mbsf. Ammonium has more variability, ranging from $12\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ in the top to $62\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ deeper in the hole. Most dissolved element profile s have some downhole structure but over narrow concentration ranges; for example, magnesiu m varies between $52.7\;\mathrm{mM}$ in the shallowest sample to $48.5\;\mathrm{mM}$ in the deepest sample. These result s suggest that diagenetic processes at Site U1561 are slow, which is consistent with this site’s openocean location and low organic matter input.
