# Abstract  

The Chicxulub impact crater, México, is unique. It is the onl y known terrestrial impact structure that has been directly linked to  a mass extinction event and the only terrestrial impact with a globa l ejecta layer. Of the three largest impact structures on Earth, Chicxulub is the best preserved. Chicxulub is also the only known terrestrial impact structure with an intact, unequivocal topographic pea k ring. Chicxulub’s role in the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction and its exceptional state of preservation make it an important natural laboratory for the study of both large impact crate r formation on Earth and other planets and the effects of large impacts on the Earth’s environment and ecology. Our understandin g of the impact process is far from complete, and despite more tha n 30 years of intense debate, we are still striving to answer the question as to why this impact was so catastrophic.  

During International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 364, Paleogene sediments and lithologies that make up th e Chicxulub peak ring were cored to investigate (1) the nature an d formational mechanism of peak rings, (2) how rocks are weakene d during large impacts, (3) the nature and extent of post-impact hydrothermal circulation, (4) the deep biosphere and habitability o f the peak ring, and (5) the recovery of life in a sterile zone. Other ke y targets included sampling the transition through a rare midlatitud e section that might include Eocene and Paleocene hyperthermal s and/or the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM); th e composition and character of the impact breccias, melt rocks, an d peak-ring rocks; the sedimentology and stratigraphy of the Paleocene–Eocene Chicxulub impact basin infill; the chronology of th e peak-ring rocks; and any observations from the core that may hel p us constrain the volume of dust and climatically active gases released into the stratosphere by this impact. Petrophysical propert y measurements on the core and wireline logs acquired during Expedition 364 will be used to calibrate geophysical models, includin g seismic reflection and potential field data, and the integration of al l the data will calibrate impact crater models for crater formation an d environmental effects. The proposed drilling directly contributes t o IODP Science Plan goals:  

Climate and Ocean Change: How resilient is the ocean to chemical perturbations? The Chicxulub impact represents an externa l forcing event that caused a $75\%$ level mass extinction. The impac t basin may also record key hyperthermals within the Paleogene.  

Biosphere Frontiers: What are the origin, composition, an d global significance of subseafloor communities? What are the limit s of life in the subseafloor? How sensitive are ecosystems and biodiversity to environmental change? Impact craters can create habitat s for subsurface life, and Chicxulub may provide information on potential habitats for life, including extremophiles, on the early Eart h and other planetary bodies. Paleontological and geochemical studies at ground zero will document how large impacts affect ecosystems and effects on biodiversity.  

Earth Connections/Earth in Motion: What are the composition, structure and dynamics of Earth’s upper mantle? What mechanism s control the occurrence of destructive earthquakes, landslides, an d tsunami? Mantle uplift in response to impacts provides insight int o dynamics that differ between Earth and other rocky planets. Impacts generate earthquakes, landslides, and tsunami, and scales tha t generally exceed plate tectonic processes yield insight into effects, the geologic record, and potential hazards.  

IODP Expedition 364 was a Mission Specific Platform expedition to obtain subseabed samples and downhole logging measurements from the sedimentary cover sequence and peak ring of th e Chicxulub impact crater. A single borehole was drilled into th e Chicxulub impact crater on the Yucatán continental shelf, recovering core from 505.7 to $1334.73\;\mathrm{m}$ below seafloor with ${\sim}99\%$ core recovery and acquiring downhole logs for the entire depth.  

# Introduction  

Peak rings are rings of hills that protrude through the crate r floor within large impact basins on terrestrial planets (Figure F1) , and there is no consensual agreement on either their formational mechanism or the nature of the rocks that comprise them (Grieve e t al., 2008). Geophysical data indicate that the peak ring at Chicxulu b is formed from rocks that have low velocity and density, and one explanation for this is that they are highly fractured and porous (Morgan et al., 2000, 2011; Gulick et al., 2013). Immediately after impact, the peak ring was submerged under water and located adjacent to  a thick pool of hot impact melt. Hence, we would expect intense hydrothermal activity within the peak ring (Ames et al., 2004; Zürche r and Kring, 2004). This activity may have provided a niche for exoti c life forms in a way similar to that of hydrothermal vent systems i n the oceans. Drilling the peak ring will allow us to determine the origin, lithology, and physical state of the rocks that form it; distinguish between competing models of peak-ring formation; an d document hydrothermal systems, microbiology, and post-impac t processes and recovery.  

# Background  

# The peak ring  

The term “peak ring” was first used to describe the often discontinuous, mountainous ring that rises above the floor of large crater s on the moon. Peak rings are internal to the main topographic crate r rim (Figure F1). Since they were first identified on the Moon, pea k rings have been observed in large terrestrial craters on all large silicate planetary bodies. Notably, peak rings do not appear to occur o n the icy satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, which indicates that crustal rheology plays a role in their formation. The peak ring is a topographic feature; it protrudes through the impact melt and brecci a that lines the floor of the crater and stands above the surroundin g terrain. As a result, the unequivocal identification of a peak ring i n Earth’s largest craters is compromised by inevitable erosion and/o r tectonism.  

Two seismic experiments were conducted in 1996 and 200 5 (Figure F2) across the Chicxulub impact structure (Morgan et al., 1997; Gulick et al., 2008). Reflection seismic data image impac t lithologies and structures to the base of the crust at about $35~\mathrm{km}$ depth (Christeson et al., 2009; Gulick et al., 2013). The impact basi n is buried beneath a few hundred meters of Cenozoic sediments, an d the present-day Cretaceous-Paleogene $\left(\mathrm{K}{-}\mathrm{Pg}\right)$ surface deepens to ${\sim}1$ s two-way traveltime $(\sim\!1\;\mathrm{km})$ , revealing a ${\sim}145~\mathrm{km}$ diameter postimpact basin (Morgan and Warner, 1999) with ring-shaped fault s reaching diameters ${>}200~\mathrm{km}$ (Gulick et al., 2008). Within this postimpact basin, there is an ${\sim}80\,\mathrm{km}$ diameter topographic ring that appears analogous to peak rings observed on other planetary bodie s (compare Figures F1, F3, F4). Reflective pre-impact stratigraph y (the Mesozoic sediments) can be tracked around the crater (Whale n et al., 2013), and large offsets in the stratigraphy define a $20{-}35\;\mathrm{km}$ wide terrace (or megablock) zone (Figure F3) (Gulick et al., 2008, 2013). Morgan and Warner (1999) argue that the head scarp of thi s terrace zone is analogous to the crater rim in peak-ring craters (Figure F1), and rings outside the head scarp (Figure F3) suggest tha t Chicxulub is a multi-ring basin (Morgan et al., 1997; Gulick et al., 2008). The acquired seismic data show that the water depth wa s deeper and the Mesozoic sediments thicker in the northeast quadrant of the crater (Bell et al., 2004; Gulick et al., 2008) and that lateral variation in the target at the impact site might explain th e current crater asymmetry (Collins et al., 2008). Velocities and densities of the rocks that form the peak ring are low (Morgan et al., 2000; Vermeesch and Morgan, 2008; Barton et al., 2010), and a high-resolution velocity model obtained using full-waveform inversion (Figure F4) shows that the uppermost peak ring is formed from abou t $100{-}150\ \mathrm{m}$ of rocks with very low $P$ -wave velocity (Morgan et al., 2011).  

Given the lack of intact peak rings exposed at the Earth’s surface, there is no consensus as to either their geologic nature (of what material are they composed and from what stratigraphic location doe s this material originate) or the mode of formation of a peak ring. Numerical simulations of large-crater formation suggest that they ar e formed during the collapse of a deep bowl-shaped “transient cavity ” formed during the initial stages of cratering (Figure F5A) (Morga n et al., 2000; Collins et al., 2002; Ivanov, 2005; Senft and Stewart, 2009). During this collapse, structural uplift of the crater floor produces a central uplift, which is overheightened and unstable unde r gravity (Figure F5B). The subsequent outward collapse of the central uplift in some way leads to the formation of a ring of peaks between the crater center and the crater rim (Morgan et al., 2000, 2011). This model for peak-ring formation is consistent with seismic data that show downthrown Mesozoic rocks lie directly beneath the peak ring at Chicxulub at all azimuths (Morgan et al., 2000; Gulick et al., 2013). However, the precise kinematics and details of the mechanics of cavity modification remain unclear. Moreover, that such emphatic collapse of the transient crater occurs at al l requires substantial weakening of target rocks relative to their stati c laboratory-measured strength (Melosh, 1979; O’Keefe and Ahrens, 1993). In numerical models, the precise kinematics of crater collapse and peak-ring formation is dependent on near-surface rheology, as well as the spatial extent, nature, and timing of th e weakening of the target rocks (e.g., Wünnemann et al., 2005).  

# Previous drilling  

Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) drilled several deep $({\sim}1.6\ \mathrm{km})$ holes into or close to the Chicxulub crater (Figure F2), completin g their drilling in the mid-1970s (Figure F6A). Unfortunately, th e amount of coring was limited, and their interest in the area wane d after they intercepted Paleozoic basement and impactites withou t any sign of hydrocarbons. Very few samples of the impact lithologies found in these wells are now available for examination. Th e Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) conducted  a shallow drilling program in the 1990s, during which impact lithologies were penetrated at three sites: U5, U6, and U7 (UrrutiaFucugauchi et al., 1996). International Continental Scientific Drilling Project (ICDP) Borehole Yaxcopoil-1 (Yax-1) was drilled ${\sim}60$ km south-southwest of the crater center (Stöffler et al., 2004; Urrutia-Fucugauchi et al., 2004) within the impact basin and inside a rin g of cenotes (Figure F6A). The general stratigraphy of the Chicxulu b crater has been constructed using the available core from these programs and the original Pemex logs (Figure F6B, F6C) (Ward et al. , 1995; Rebolledo-Vieyra and Urrutia-Fucugauchi, 2004).  

The onshore wells indicate that post-impact sediments deepe n from a few hundred meters at radii ${}_{>}90\$ to ${\sim}1.1$ km within the cente r of the post-impact basin (Figure F6B); this thickening of the Cenozoic sequence is in agreement with the offshore seismic data. Within the impact basin, Wells C1, S1, and Y6 penetrated a fe w hundred meters of suevite and $200{-}500\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of impact melt rock, whereas outside the basin, Wells T1, Y2, Y5A, Y1, and Y4 penetrated a few hundred meters of melt-poor lithic breccia (Hildebran d et al., 1991; Sharpton et al., 1996; Urrutia-Fucugauchi et al., 2011). Several wells penetrated thick sequences of Cretaceous rocks. Clos e to the structure, these sequences are ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{km}$ thick and comprise dolomites and carbonates, with some thick beds of Lower Cretaceou s anhydrite. Wells Y1 and Y2 penetrated Paleozoic basement at ${\sim}3.3$ km depth. UNAM Well U5 shows Cenozoic rocks above suevite, and in Well U7, suevitic breccia overlies melt-poor lithic breccia, composed mainly of sedimentary clasts rich in evaporitic material (Urrutia-Fucugauchi et al., 2008). The upper breccias have hig h magnetic susceptibilities, low seismic velocities, low density, an d high porosities and permeabilities; in contrast, the lower breccia s show low susceptibilities, variable seismic velocities, and lower porosities and permeabilities (Urrutia–Fucugauchi et al., 1996; Rebolledo-Vieyra  and  Urrutia-Fucugauchi,  2006).  In  Well  U6, Cenozoic rocks directly overlie this melt-poor lithic breccia, with a n erosional contact between them (Figure F6C). The melt-poor lithi c breccia in the two UNAM wells could be the same impact brecci a observed in Wells Y4, Y1, Y5A, Y2, and T1. No onshore wells hav e penetrated the peak ring, and no previous offshore wells wer e drilled into the Chicxulub impact structure.  

ICDP Borehole Yax-1 is located ${\sim}60\,\mathrm{km}$ radial distance from th e crater center and is positioned interior of the crater rim. Drilling recovered core from the ${\sim}800\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick Cenozoic sequence, impac t breccias, and underlying parautochthonous Cretaceous rocks t o $1511\,\mathrm{~m~}$ below the surface (Urrutia-Fucugauchi et al., 2004). Th e earliest Cenozoic sediments indicate gravity flows and resurge deposits formed part of the initial crater fill (Goto et al., 2004; Whale n et al., 2008, 2013) and contain geochemical evidence for long-lasting hydrothermal venting into the ocean (Rowe et al., 2004; Zurche r and Kring, 2004). Unfortunately, its location on a steep slope mean t studies of the post-impact section were plagued by coarse-graine d redeposited carbonates and lithification, and the very basal Paleocene appears to be missing (Arz et al., 2004; Smit et al., 2004; Rebolledo-Vieyra and Urrutia-Fucugauchi, 2004; Whalen et al., 2013). The $100\,\mathrm{m}$ thick melt-rich impactite sequence is complex and composed of six distinct units (Claeys et al., 2003; Kring et al., 2004; Stöffler et al., 2004; Wittmann et al., 2007), which were modified b y post-impact hydrothermal circulation (Hecht et al., 2004). The Cretaceous rocks appear to be formed from a number of megablocks, composed of dolomite, limestone, and about $27\%$ anhydrite, whic h have rotated relative to each other, probably during the crater modification stage (Kenkmann et al., 2004). The megablock lithologie s are intruded by suevitic dikes, impact melt dikes, and clastic, polymict dikes (Wittmann et al., 2004).  

# Scientific objectives  

Expedition 364 was designed to address the following objective s through drilling at Site M0077:  

• The nature and formation of a topographic peak ring; • How rocks are weakened during large impacts to allow them to collapse and form relatively wide, flat craters; • The nature and extent of post-impact hydrothermal circulation; • The habitability of the peak ring and effect of this impact on the modern and ancient deep biosphere;  

• The recovery of life in a sterile zone;   
• The nature of the Eocene and Paleocene hyperthermals and the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) transition;   
• The nature and composition of the impact breccias, melt rocks, and peak-ring rocks;   
• The volume of dust and climatically active gases released into the stratosphere by this impact;   
• The climatic effects of this impact;   
• The sedimentology and stratigraphy of the Paleocene–Eocene Chicxulub impact basin infill;   
• The chronology of the peak-ring rocks and impact lithologies;   
• Petrophysical properties measured on cores and downhole to calibrate geophysical models and integrate with seismic velocity data; and   
• Integration of all data to calibrate impact crater models for crater formation and environmental effects.  

# The nature and formation of peak rings  

Hole M0077A sampled material that forms a topographic pea k ring (Figure F4) and reveals the lithologic and physical state of thes e rocks, including porosity, fracturing, and extent of shock effects. The recovered core will be used to test the working hypotheses tha t peak rings are formed from (1) overturned and uplifted basemen t rocks, (2) megabreccias, or (3) some other material. If the peak rin g is formed from uplifted rocks, as predicted by several independen t numerical simulations of crater formation (Figure F5) (Collins et al., 2002; Ivanov, 2005; Senft and Stewart, 2009), then we can estimat e their depth of origin (upper crust or deeper) using metamorphi c grade, thermochronology, and possibly remanent magnetism. Th e orientation of impact-induced discontinuities, which may includ e breccia zones, brittle shear faults, and melt-filled fractures, will b e used to infer the strain geometry (i.e., the orientation) and potentially also the magnitude of the three principal strain axes durin g peak-ring formation and thus constrain the kinematics of peak-rin g formation. Collectively, these data will be used to discriminate between models of peak-ring formation and to groundtruth dynami c models of crater formation (Figure F5), which now include dilatancy: the increase in porosity induced during cratering and th e cause of the gravity low across impact craters (Collins, 2014). Fo r example, in the numerical simulations shown in Figure F5, shoc k pressures experienced by peak-ring rocks are predicted to be between 10 and $50\ \mathrm{GPa}$ , whereas they are expected to be relativel y lower on average in the model by Baker et al. (2016), which is base d on analyses of peak ring craters on the Moon and Mercury.  

# The weakening mechanism  

Numerical modeling of large impacts indicates that rocks mus t behave in a fluid-like manner for a short period of time after impac t to allow the dramatic collapse of a large bowl-shaped transient cavity to form a broad, flat final crater (Melosh and Ivanov, 1999). I n these models, the material that forms the peak ring has traveled th e greatest distance during crater formation (e.g., Figure F5) and thu s should have undergone the most mechanical weakening. Providin g a physical explanation for the apparent transitory low strength o f the target is an enduring and challenging problem in impact cratering mechanics. Proposed weakening mechanisms include acousti c fluidization (Melosh, 1979; Melosh and Ivanov, 1999), thermal softening (O’Keefe and Ahrens, 1993), and strain‐rate weakening (Senf t and Stewart, 2009). Geological investigations at complex crater s provide clues to the weakening mechanism, such as evidence fo r cataclastic flow (Kenkmann, 2003) and the identification of individual blocks surrounded by breccias in accordance with the bloc k model of acoustic fluidization (Ivanov, 1994; Kenkmann et al., 2005; Riller and Lieger, 2008). Eroded complex craters often possess larg e zones of pseudotachylytic breccia, which may act to reduce frictio n on fault planes (Spray, 1992; Reimold and Gibson, 2005; MohrWestheide et al., 2009; Riller et al., 2010), although this appears t o conflict with observational data that suggests melt was emplaced i n a tensional stress regime (Lieger et al., 2009).  

Quasistatic mechanical loading tests of intact and brecciate d target material will be used to measure the strength difference between friction‐controlled deformation of crushed rock and fracture-controlled deformation of intact rock. Such data, along wit h our analyses of samples of the peak-ring rocks, will be used to investigate what mechanism(s) allow the target rocks to behave temporarily as a fluid in response to hypervelocity impact.  

# Hydrothermal circulation  

Both the post-impact sediments and peak-ring rocks will be examined for evidence of hydrothermal alteration and post-impac t venting into the ocean to answer questions such as how long did th e circulation last, and how high was the maximum temperature ? Models of hydrothermal systems in impact craters imply enhance d flow in peak rings (e.g., Figure F7) (Ames et al., 2004; Zürcher an d Kring, 2004; Schwenzer and Kring, 2009), and thus Site M0077 is a n excellent location to investigate the hydrothermal system at Chicxulub. This line of inquiry will include petrological assessment an d thermochronology, as well as X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), fluid inclusion, and stable isotope analyses to examine the alteration assemblage and characterize the composition o f the hydrothermal fluids (Ames et al., 2004; Lüders and Rickers, 2004; Zürcher and Kring, 2004; Osinski et al., 2005, 2013). Was hydrothermal circulation focused in specific zones, as it was in Hol e Yax-1 (along faults and lithologic contacts), or was it more pervasive? Wireline logs and petrophysical measurements on the core will be used to measure fracture density and porosity, which will hel p assess ancient permeability—an important parameter in modelin g hydrothermal systems (Abramov and Kring, 2007).  

# Deep biosphere and habitability  

Analyses at different depths of the borehole focusing on sample s of melt, crystal xenoliths embedded in the melt, and crystals fro m the peak ring itself will be used to determine the duration of the crater cooling from $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to below $200^{\circ}C$ and ultimately provide bette r quantification on how long a crater stays warm enough to be suitable for life evolution and deep subsurface microbial communities.  

Both the post-impact sediments and peak-ring rocks will be examined for present-day microbiology and biosignatures of past life. Impacts can have an adverse effect on the deep biosphere due to hydrothermal sterilization, but they may also lead to an increase in microbial abundance due to impact-induced fracturing (Cockell et al., 2002, 2005). The diversity of microbial life will be quantified an d compared with geological and geochemical data to answer questions such as was the microbiology shaped by the post-impact hydrothermal system, and did organic matter get trapped withi n hydrothermal minerals? The deep biosphere will be investigated using culturing, molecular biological analyses of DNA, searching fo r biosignatures such as hopanoids and other lipids/biomolecules, an d paired analyses of paleome (the genome of an extinct species) an d lipid biomarkers (Cockell et al., 2005; 2009; Coolen and Overmann, 2007; Coolen et al., 2013). Iron isotopes will also be used to detec t biosignatures because they are particularly useful for studies of ancient, severely metamorphosed and/or altered rocks (Yamaguchi e t al., 2005). The rehabitation of the deep biosphere following a larg e impact, as seen at the Chesapeake impact structure (Figure F8), wil l shed light on whether peak rings and impact breccias are an ecological niche for exotic life and thus potentially important habitats fo r early life on Earth (Kring and Cohen, 2002; Bryce et al., 2015).  

# Recovery of life  

Immediately after impact, the ocean was likely sterile, at least locally. We will use core through the post-impact sediments to examine the recolonization of the ocean, including what biota came bac k first (benthic versus planktonic, dinoflagellates, specialists versu s generalists), how long it took to return to normal conditions, an d whether cold-water species returned quickly. Of interest will b e nannoplankton recovery at “ground zero” in comparison to th e global response (e.g., Jiang et al., 2010). There was likely a significan t lag in recovery due to a long-term, impact-initiated hydrotherma l circulation system (Abramov and Kring, 2007). Did diversity gradually recover with the hardiest taxa appearing first and other tax a taking longer to populate the impact basin, or did the whole assemblage return simultaneously once the environment stabilized? Reconstruction of the environment of the earliest Paleocene will b e achieved using stable carbon and oxygen isotopes of planktonic an d benthic foraminifers and fine-fraction carbonates, as well as stabl e carbon and nitrogen isotopes of sedimentary organic matter. Thes e analyses combined with major and trace element proxies for biologic productivity and redox conditions will inform the paleoceanographic conditions in the basin after impact and provide clues t o when normal marine carbon and nitrogen cycling were restored. Study of biomarkers at the molecular level (high-pressure liqui d chromatography [HPLC] and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry [LC-MS]) and pigments (chlorophylls, bacteriochlorophylls,  and  its  degradations  products)  from  photosyntheti c organisms (algae and photosynthetic bacteria) may indicate change s in and evolution of photosynthetic organism populations after impact.  

It is expected that both marine and terrestrial organic matte r have accumulated in the post-impact sediments and that the paire d stratigraphic analysis of the paleome and lipid biomarkers and thei r isotopic compositions using precisely dated core material will provide detailed insights into post-impact environmental condition s and the recovery and evolution of surface and deep subsurface lif e (Coolen et al., 2007, 2013). Of interest is the ocean chemistry an d temperature immediately following the impact and any indicators o f climatic recovery. Are there signs of local hydrothermal ventin g (Zürcher and Kring, 2004), short-term global cooling (Vellekoop e t al., 2014), and/or indicators of ocean acidification? How long did i t take to return to normal conditions? Oxygen isotope ratios, in particular, may help constrain surface and bottom water temperature s in the immediate post-impact interval. Intrinsic magnetic properties of sediments can be used as proxy of the relative abundance o f biogenic versus detrital fraction in the sediments, and changes i n magnetic mineralogy can be attributed to changes in the depositional environment (redox conditions, detrital source, etc.).  

# Eocene and Paleocene hyperthermals and the PETM transition  

Transient warm events during the “greenhouse” phase of Earth’ s climate history, also called hyperthermals, are key insights into th e feedbacks in the climate system. The Paleocene to Eocene interval s cored during Expedition 364 are particularly interesting due to th e potential to recover the PETM, as well as late Paleocene and earl y Eocene events (Figure F9). Sedimentary records of many PET M transitions and hyperthermals suffer from poor preservation due t o dissolution. The section we recovered at Chicxulub is atypical, as i t is in a subtropical location and within a semi-isolated basin abov e the calcium compensation depth (CCD); therefore, carbonate sediment accumulation should have been maintained throughout th e Paleocene and Eocene.  

Key to understanding any recovered hyperthermal intervals including the PETM will be the documentation of changing paleoceanographic conditions (depth and redox state), sedimentar y environments, and biological productivity. Biological productivit y will be evaluated through analysis of total organic carbon, stabl e isotopes from organic matter (C, N) and carbonates (C, O), an d XRF geochemical analyses to determine concentrations of micronutrients such as Cu, Ni, and Zn. XRF analyses of redox-sensitive trac e metals (Cr, Ni, Mo, V, and Ur) will provide insight into bottom water oxygenation during the PETM and Eocene hyperthermals. Biomarkers may distinguish between terrestrial and methane hydrate s and thus help constrain the cause of warming. High-resolution biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy will be used to obtain a robust age model in the post-impact sediments and identify ke y events in the cored interval, including the hyperthermals an d PETM.  

Changes in continental weathering during the Paleocene–Eocene transition will be evaluated through studying clay mineralogy. There was an intensified hydrological cycle and warming across th e PETM (Zachos et al., 2001), and inputs of kaolinite, illite, palygorskite, and/or sepiolite into sedimentary basins during this perio d have been linked to an increase in runoff (John et al., 2012).  

# Impact breccias, melt rocks, and peak-ring rocks  

Chicxulub breccias appear to be quite variable, in particula r with respect to the amount of anhydrite and the lithology and age o f basement  clasts  (Kettrup  et  al.,  2000;  Kring,  2005;  UrrutiaFucugauchi et al., 2008). The mineralogical and geochemical characterization of the impactites and peak-ring rocks will provide ke y information on target rock composition (Koeberl et al., 2012). W e will also search for an extraterrestrial signature using platinu m group element (PGE) analyses and Os and $_\mathrm{Cr}$ isotopes (Gelinas e t al., 2004; Tagle and Hecht, 2006; Trinquier et al., 2006; Goderis e t al., 2012; Sato et al., 2013, 2015) to determine whether a measurabl e fraction of the projectile remains at the impact site or whether mos t projectile material ends up within the global $\mathrm{K-Pg}$ layer (Artemiev a and Morgan, 2009). High-resolution $^{40}\mathrm{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{Ar}$ analyses and electro n microscopy on shocked and melted impactites, as well as U/Pb dating of zircon and other thermochronometers, will be used to stud y their pressure-temperature-time and deformational history and fo r high-precision dating of the Chicxulub impact. Shock metamorphism of the feldspathic components will be used to investigate ho w impact processes affect argon (Ar) retention (Pickersgill et al., 2015). Shock metamorphism and pyrometamorphic indicators fo r rock-forming minerals will help constrain peak shock pressure an d temperature regimes (Grieve et al., 1996; Tomioka et al., 2007; Wittmann et al., 2009; Huber et al., 2011; Rae et al., 2015). Compositional and structural investigations of any intruded dikes will allo w assessment of their origin, energy of emplacement, and timing and, for example, discover whether melt within dikes is more mafic tha n the impact melt in the central crater, as it is in Borehole Yax-1 (Wittmann et al., 2004).  

Magnetic susceptibility and paleomagnetic measurements wil l be used to investigate whether hydrothermal circulation led to th e formation of ferromagnetic minerals and a chemical remanent magnetization (Quesnel et al., 2013). These measurements will also u s to evaluate whether hydrothermal circulation is the source of th e strong magnetic anomaly recorded at surface and whether a component of the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) is shock induced (Tikoo et al., 2015) or is detrital remanent magnetization, a s it is in the post-impact sediments in Borehole Yax-1 (RebolledoVieyra and Urrutia-Fucugauchi, 2004).  

# Dust, climatically active gases, and wildfires  

The study of the shock and thermal effects recorded in the carbonate and evaporite impactites will help to constrain more precisely the degassing process of carbonates and evaporates from th e Yucatán target rock. Placing constraints on the impact energy wit h numerical simulations and on the lithology, shock state, and porosity of the target rocks is important because these are all critical input parameters for modeling the environmental effects of thi s impact (Pope et al., 1997; Pierazzo et al., 2003). Solid, melted, an d vaporized material from the asteroid and target rocks are ejecte d away from the impact site within an expanding plume (Figure F10), and the mass, velocity, and composition of these ejecta are dependent on impact angle (Artemieva and Morgan, 2009; Morgan et al., 2013). The duration and strength of the thermal pulse delivered a t the Earth’s surface by reentering ejecta varies with direction an d distance from Chicxulub (Morgan et al., 2013), and this variation affects the likelihood of ignition of flora (Belcher et al., 2015). Geophysical and drill core data and 3-D numerical simulations of th e impact will be used to constrain impact angle and direction and better constrain the intensity of the thermal pulse around the globe.  

# Post-impact sequence, including resurge and/or tsunami deposits  

Was the peak ring (being a topographic high) protected from resurge deposits? Or is it covered by wash-back deposits such as multitiered, coarse-grained, reworked impact breccias or cross-bedde d sediments overlain by a K-Pg Ir-rich layer? What is the history o f peak-ring burial within the impact basin into the Eocene?  

We will investigate the uppermost peak-ring deposits to determine the events immediately post-impact. There may be evidenc e of repeated tsunami and seiche surges, as observed at Brazos River, Texas (USA), in the form of several distinct graded layers (Vellekoo p et al., 2014).  

We will also use drilling, a vertical seismic profile (VSP) experiment, and other logging data to identify the borehole depths an d core-based lithologic contrasts that generate horizons in our reflection data (Figures F2, F3, F4). With this core-log-seismic mapping, we can identify the stratigraphic age of reflectors and map thes e across the impact basin using the extensive suite of seismic reflection data acquired in 1996 and 2005. Sedimentological and stratigraphic data are key to understanding the paleoceanographic an d sea level history across this impact basin (Whalen et al., 2013). Detailed biostratigraphic and sedimentologic studies including analysis  of  grain  size,  mineralogy,  sedimentary  structures,  an d ichnofabric using the cores and X-ray computed tomography (CT ) scans will be crucial in documenting the post-impact sedimentar y history. Radioisotopic dating of ash layers in the post-impact section will be used along with magnetostratigraphic and biostratigraphic analyses to investigate the volcanic history of this portion o f the Gulf of Mexico and to additionally constrain the post-impac t age model. Drill core data will be used to groundtruth seismic reflectors, which can be tracked into adjacent deep-water sections t o help understand the nature of lower Cenozoic sequences in the Gul f of Mexico, which are difficult to date due to the lack of publicl y available scientific cores. This mapping into the broader Gulf o f Mexico will enable testing of models for large-scale basin margi n collapse caused by impact generated earthquakes and tsunami (Sanford et al., 2016).  

# Chronology of peak-ring rocks and impact lithologies  

Of key interest is the age of the Chicxulub impact and the resulting $\mathrm{K-Pg}$ boundary deposits that it caused (Renne et al., 2013; Schulte et al., 2010). Therefore, a goal of the expedition was to determine the ages of impact lithologies and impact melt and any rese t ages on uplifted target rocks at the impact site. This work will b e accomplished through Ar/Ar and U/Pb ages on impact glasses an d $\mathrm{Ar/Ar}$ dating of feldspars paired with U/Pb dating of zircons. Additionally, a range of thermochronometers will be explored within th e drilled samples to investigate pressure-temperature-time path s within the peak ring.  

# Petrophysical groundtruth and geophysical integration  

Wireline logging and petrophysical measurements on the cor e will be used to groundtruth potential fields’ geophysical model s (gravity, magnetic, refraction, and magnetotelluric data) and integrate with 2-D and 3-D seismic velocity data. Core- and boreholebased measurements will be critical to improving our understanding of crater structure away from the drill hole, in particular onshore  where  deep  borehole  and  seismic  data  are  sparse  t o nonexistent. Drilling will allow us to address questions such as wha t is the cause of the strong magnetic anomaly recorded at surface, an d what is the cause of the low seismic velocities and densities withi n the peak ring (are these fractured deep-crustal basement rocks, megabreccia, or some other material), and is the thin ( $100{-}150\ \mathrm{m}$ thick) layer of very low velocity rocks forming the uppermost lithology of the peak ring composed of impact breccias? We will also us e borehole imaging to constrain dips within the peak ring stratigraph y to test for overturning during emplacement and verify whether th e dips are consistent with the observed inward-dipping reflectors an d region of lowered velocities. Magnetic properties of the impactite s and peak-ring rocks can be used to investigate causes of the magnetic anomaly data throughout the crater and as a tool to correlat e between onshore boreholes and offshore Site M0077.  

# Operational strategy  

Expedition 364 was drilled using a Mission Specific Platfor m due to the relatively deep target depth ( $1500\;\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth belo w seafloor [DSF]) and shallow-water location $\left(19.8\,\mathrm{~m}\right)$ ). In order t o meet the scientific aims, an Atlas Copco T3WDH mining rig wa s cantilevered from the bow of the jack-up platform, the L/B Myrtle. The vessel was contracted from Montco Offshore with drilling services provided by Drilling Observation and Sampling of the Earth s Continental Crust (DOSECC).  

The downhole logging program was managed by the Europea n Petrophysics Consortium (EPC), and the University of Albert a (Canada) and the University of Texas at Austin (USA) were contracted to carry out the VSP measurements.  

The first phase of mobilization began on 12 March 2016 i n Fourchon, Louisiana (USA). The vessel transited to the drill sit e (with refueling and weather delays), arriving on station on 5 April. The final mobilization was completed on station, and the offshor e operational phase began with open-hole drilling on 8 April. Operations continued for 48 days, culminating on 26 May. Following a final phase of downhole logging, the vessel returned to Progreso, Mexico, before continuing transit back to Fourchon for full demobilization.  

A single hole was drilled. A series of drill strings of reducing diameters were utilized in order to maximize the likelihood of reaching the target depth. The borehole configuration comprises th e following components (Figure F11):  

• Open-hole drilling: • $12\%$ inch open-hole drilling from the seabed to $15.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF • $9\%$ inch casing and cementation to $15.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF • $7\%$ inch open-hole drilling from $15.5\;\mathrm{m}$ to $503.6\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF • $6\%$ inch casing and cementing to $503.6\;\mathrm{m}$ • The base of the hole was advanced to $505.7\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF whilst clearing cement and debris from the bottom of the hole   
• Coring: • Coring with oversize PQ3, (outer diameter [OD] 5.875 inches $[149.225\,\mathrm{mm}]$ ) from 505.7 to $707.1\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, producing an ${\sim}83\,\mathrm{mm}$ diameter core. • $5\%$ inch casing was set to $701\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF before changing the core barrel and bit size. • Coring with PQ3, (OD 4.827 inches $122.6058\;\mathrm{mm}]$ ) From $707.1\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF to the base of the hole at $1334.69\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF, maintaining ${\sim}83~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter cores.  

# Table T1 summarizes hole details and recovery.  

The downhole logging strategy involved a similar stepwise approach to ensure logs were collected from the maximum interva l possible. Details of the downhole logging program are summarize d in Downhole logging.  

During the operational phase of Expedition 364 from 5 April t o 30 May 2016, $2.67\%$ of the operations time was spent mobilizing, $0.22\%$ in transit, and $11.48\%$ on downtime due to equipment. Th e remaining $85.67\%$ of the offshore phase was for drilling, coring, an d downhole logging operations.  

# Principal results  

Open-hole drilling occurred from the seabed to ${\sim}500\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF, and core was recovered between 505.70 and 1334.73 meters belo w seafloor (mbsf). Attempts to recover drilling cuttings from th e open-hole section were largely unsuccessful due to loss of the drilling fluid into the formation. In the upper cores, a sequence of postimpact sediments was recovered between 505.70 and 617.28 mbsf. The peak-ring rocks recovered comprise suevite above clast-poo r impact melt rock from 617.28 to 747.14 mbsf. This interval overlie s shocked felsic basement rocks intruded by pre-impact mafic an d felsic igneous dikes as well as suevite and impact melt rock betwee n 747.14 and 1334.73 mbsf.  

Results are divided into four sections that reflect the key lithological and structural sequences encountered in Hole M0077A:  

• Open hole: 0–505.7 m DSF  

• Post-impact sediments: Core 1R to Section 40R-1, 109.4 cm (505.70–617.28 mbsf) • Upper peak ring (suevite and impact melt rock): Section 40R-1, $109.4\,\mathrm{cm}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , to base of Core 95R (617.28–747.14 mbsf) • Lower peak ring (granitoids, pre-impact dikes, suevite, and impact melt rock): Cores 96R through 303R (747.14–1334.73 mbsf)  

The divisions chosen here are based on observations of core an d logging data only. These intervals do not represent the precise locations of lithologic boundaries within the core.  

# Lithostratigraphy and CT facies  

# Lithostratigraphy  

# Post-impact sediments  

The post-impact sedimentary rocks of Hole M0077A consist o f a diverse suite of lithologies including claystone, black shale, dar k marlstone/claystone, marlstone, siltstone, and limestone divide d into wackestone, packstone, and grainstone. Most lithologies ar e dominantly fine grained (clay to silt sized) except for local grainstones that contain clasts that are dominantly sand sized. Mos t lithologies have examples of planar to wavy laminated textures wit h ichnofabric indexes of 1 to 2 or are bedded at the centimeter scale. Thicker bedded units are dominantly bioturbated with ichnofabri c indices of 3 to 5. Cyclic or rhythmic arrangement of lithologies i s common, with cycles typically grading upward from dark marlstone/claystone through marlstone and wackestone and/or packstone.  Except  locally  (i.e.,  Core  37R-1),  grainstones  are  thin, laminated, or cross-laminated packages intercalated with fine r grained facies.  

The relative distribution and proportions of different lithologies, as well as specific surfaces indicating erosional truncation o f underlying facies or abrupt change in lithology, were used to divid e the post-impact sedimentary rocks into different lithostratigraphi c subunits (1A–1G; Table T2). Most subunits are between 20 and 2 7 m thick except for Subunits 1B, 1F, and 1G, which are all less than 1 0 m thick. Subunit 1A is dominated by dark marlstone/claystone. Uni t 1B is mainly limestone with intercalated marlstone and dark marlstone/claystone. Subunits 1C and 1D are largely composed of dar k marlstone/claystone but also contain marlstone and limestone. Subunits 1E and 1F are primarily wackestone and packstone. Subunit s 1D and 1E are the only units that contain black shale. All units hav e sporadic rare to common beds of bluish claystone that were likel y deposited as volcanic ash. Subunit 1G is very thin $(<\!1\ m)$ and unusual lithologically as a fining-upward calcareous siltstone dominated by thin rhythmic alternations of darker and lighter colore d laminae or beds that form the base of the post-impact sedimentar y succession. The inclusion of greenish clasts of glass in the lower par t of the unit signals the transition to the underlying suevite of Subuni t 2A (Table T2).  

# Peak ring  

From Section 40R-1, $109.4~\mathrm{cm}$ , to the end of the drill cores a t Section 303R-3, $56~\mathrm{cm}$ , a succession of Chicxulub crater impactite s occur, comprising suevites, impact melt rocks, and shocked basement rocks.  

The upper peak ring consists of an impactite sequence fro m Section 40R-1, $109.4~\mathrm{cm}$ , to Section 87R-2, $90~\mathrm{cm}$ , and is divide d into two units: Units 2 and 3 (Table T2). Unit 2 contains $104~\mathrm{m}$ o f suevites with impact melt rock clasts, as well as lithic clasts from th e carbonate platform and basement ranging in size from submillimeter to over $25\;\mathrm{cm}$ . Clasts are subangular to subrounded. The suevit e matrix is a fine-grained, micritic carbonate. Subunit 2A is characterized by repeated fining-upward or coarsening features in the suevites with clast sizes $<\!2\,\mathrm{cm}$ . The transition to Subunit 2B in Sectio n 55R-3, $11~\mathrm{{cm}}$ , is the lowest erosional contact observed in Unit 2. Subunit 2B consists of a single $48\;\mathrm{m}$ fining-upward succession. Subunit 2C begins at Section 83R-1, $75\,\mathrm{cm}$ , with a gradational change t o a $\mathrm{\sim}9\,\mathrm{m}$ thick, dark brown suevite matrix with very poorly sorted angular to subangular clasts.  

Unit 3 begins at Section 87R-2, $90~\mathrm{cm}$ , and is composed of impact melt rock with abundant $(>\!25\%)$ clasts. It is divided into tw o subunits. Subunit 3A is characterized by a $16\mathrm{~m~}$ thick mixture o f green and black melt. The green material sometimes forms a matri x with angular fragments of black melt and can be intimately intermixed with black melt, forming schlieren of green material. Withi n the black melt are found centimeter- to decimeter-sized clasts o f target material composed of metamorphic and igneous target lithologies, including decimeter-sized clasts of granodiorite and gneiss. Subunit 3B is ${\sim}9.5~\mathrm{m}$ thick coherent black melt unit that begins a t Section 92R-3, $17\,\mathrm{cm}$ . Clasts are composed of metamorphic and igneous target lithologies, but the subunit lacks visible clasts of sedimentary lithologies. Clasts of granite dominate and increase i n abundance toward the base of the subunit and are up to $42~\mathrm{{cm}}$ i n diameter.  

Beneath Section 95R-3, $117\,\mathrm{cm}$ , the lower peak ring recovered a t Site M0077 includes a long succession of felsic basement rocks o f granitoid composition (Unit 4). Petrographically, these rocks ar e characterized chiefly by coarse-grained granite to syenite hostin g aplite and pegmatite dikes. Moreover, granitoid rocks are intrude d by three types of subvolcanic dikes or dike swarms including felsite, dacite, and diabase/dolerite. Petrographic analysis shows that thi s suite of basement rocks is pervasively shocked, with quartz an d feldspar grains displaying planar deformation features throughou t the entire unit. Granitoids also show localized zones of pervasiv e shearing and deformation, with notable millimeter to centimete r thick cataclastic bands and microbrittle foliation.  

Granitoid basement rocks host several smaller bodies of suevit e and impact melt rock ( $15\,\mathrm{cm}$ to $4\,\mathrm{m}$ thick). An approximately ${100}\,\mathrm{m}$ thick unit of suevite and impact melt rock occurs at 1215–131 6 mbsf (Cores 265R–298R). These two lithologies form a nearly continuous unit, with only a few decimeter- to meter-scale intercalations of granite. Flow banding occurs in both the impact mel t rock and suevite. Clasts are melt fragments, granite, and other basement lithologies and are characterized by a notable lack of carbonates compared to the suevites and impact melt rocks in the uppe r peak ring. Granitic rocks were cored in Cores 298R–303R, and th e final Sections 303R-2 and 303R-3 of the borehole consist of a $78\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ thick polymict breccia mingled with impact melt rock.  

# CT facies  

CT facies were described throughout the hole. Distinctions between different CT facies were made on the basis of CT values, bul k density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{b}}\right)$ , effective atomic number $(Z_{\mathrm{eff}})$ , and common textures. In general, CT facies show a good match with the lithologic boundaries and lithostratigraphic units identified during visual core description. CT facies are described in the context of higher and lowe r CT values. Similar lithologies usually display similar CT values an d are represented by a grayscale color scheme. In addition, CT value s are compared to images of $\rho_{\mathrm{b}}$ and $\mathrm{{Z_{eff}}.}$ .  

# Post-impact sediments  

CT scans of individual lithologies and the defined units of postimpact  sediments  were  described.  Marlstone  and  dark  claystone/marlstone lithologies can be associated with light gray an d dark gray intervals that display mainly low ${\mathfrak{p}}_{\mathrm{b}}$ and high $Z_{\mathrm{eff}}$ values. Overall, the reoccurring, relatively thin claystone layers are represented by black CT intervals that correspond to relatively low $\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{b}}$ an d $Z_{\mathrm{eff}}$ values. The wackestones and packstones of the limestone lithologies are mainly associated with light to dark gray and black intervals that reflect a broad spectrum of ${\mathfrak{p}}_{\mathrm{b}}$ and $Z_{\mathrm{eff}}$ values. Th e grainstone lithology presents itself uniformly as a light gray interval associated with high $\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{b}}$ and $Z_{\mathrm{eff}}$ values.  

A CT facies is also defined for the lithostratigraphic units (Subunits 1A–1G). Subunits 1A–1C show light gray, dark gray, and blac k intervals that are associated with low $\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{b}}$ and high $Z_{\mathrm{eff}}$ values (Subunits 1A and 1C) and relatively high $\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{b}}$ and $\mathrm{Z_{eff}}$ values (Subunit 1B). Subunit 1D is still represented by the same color scheme, but th e black and white intervals increase in thickness. The ${\mathfrak{p}}_{\mathrm{b}}$ and $Z_{\mathrm{eff}}$ values vary depending on the represented lithology (e.g., interbedde d marlstones). Subunits 1E and 1F consist predominantly of one ligh t gray CT interval with a few thin dark gray to black areas. The ligh t gray can be correlated with high but also low $Z_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and quite variabl e density values. Subunit 1G is represented by light to dark gray intervals that are overall associated with relatively high $\rho_{\mathrm{b}}$ and high $\mathrm{{Z_{eff}}.}$ .  

# Upper peak ring  

CT facies for Units 2 and 3 were described during visual cor e description. The subunits of Units 2 and 3, divided by visual cor e description alone, can be clearly seen in the CT data. Additionally, certain subunits (e.g., Subunit 2C) have abrupt and unusual change s in CT character throughout the unit.  

Unit 2 has an overall trend of increasing CT number. Clast size , density, and compositional variation can be clearly discerned usin g the CT data. The increase in clast size with depth in the suevite i s reflected by an increase in variability of the average CT numbe r with depth.  

Unit 3 marks a slight drop in average CT number compared t o Subunit 2C, and CT numbers remain constant, with some variability, through Subunits 3A and 3B. Texturally, Subunits 3A and 3B ar e very distinct in the CT data. Subunit 3A has a fluidal texture of intermixed light gray and dark gray material, whereas Subunit 3B i s considerably more homogeneous and contains occasional clasts.  

# Lower peak ring  

CT facies for Unit 4 were described during visual core description. There are several CT facies within Unit 4, all linked to the described lithology. In general, all of the lithologies within the lowe r peak ring section are easily distinguished on the basis of CT number, $\rho_{\mathrm{b}},Z_{\mathrm{eff}},$ and texture.  

Granitoids are easily identified in the CT data by their distinctive texture and the individual textures of the constituent minerals. Deformation to the granitoids generally corresponds to low $\rho_{\mathrm{b}}$ regions of the rocks. Pre-impact subvolcanic rocks are generally fin e grained (although occasionally porphyritic); nonetheless, each o f these units can be distinguished based on their CT number, $\rho_{\mathrm{b}},$ an d $\mathrm{{Z_{eff}}.}$ The suevites and impact melt rocks within the lower peak rin g are distinctly different in the CT data from those found in the uppe r peak ring, and this difference is expressed primarily by their CT textures. In both locations, the suevites and impact melt rocks are easily distinguished from each other by the higher $\rho_{\mathrm{b}}$ and $Z_{\mathrm{eff}}$ of th e impact melt rocks.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Seventeen age-diagnostic biostratigraphic datums were identified at Site M0077, ranging from the middle Eocene to the base o f the Paleocene. The Eocene section ranges from planktonic foraminifer Zone E7b to E5 and calcareous nannofossil Zone CP12 to CP10. Eocene sediments at Site M0077 are characterized by diverse bu t variable assemblages of both foraminifers and nannofossils an d contains rare to dominant radiolarians, which are often associate d with more organic-rich, laminated, and sometimes indurated lithologies that can only be examined in thin section. Benthic foraminifers are relatively rare and comprise an assemblage indicative o f middle bathyal depths $500{-}700\;\mathrm{m}$ below sea level).  

A set of stacked unconformities spanning Sections 36R- 4 through 37R-1 $({\sim}606.5{-}607.5\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) separate the Paleocene and Eocene sections and include several partial intervals of the upper Paleocene (including sediments spanning the PETM; nannofossi l Zone CP8). The lower Paleocene appears to be complete and range s from planktonic foraminifer Zone P3b to Pα. Nannofossil zonatio n is difficult in this interval, and the assemblage is dominated b y bloom taxa (e.g., Braarudosphaera). Thoracosphaera, a calcareou s dinoflagellate common in early Danian marine records, is ver y abundant at the base of the post-impact sediments. Below Zone $\mathrm{P}\upalpha$ is a $40\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ brown siltstone that contains a number of Maastrichtia n foraminifers and nannoplankton indicative of impact-related reworking and/or survivors.  

Analysis of micro- and macrofossil material in the impact breccia reveals a diverse assemblage of Cretaceous organisms spannin g the Early Cretaceous to the Maastrichtian that are indicative of  a number of environments, from shallow-water carbonate platform s to open-shelf pelagic limestones.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The primary goal of shore-based paleomagnetic studies was t o produce a preliminary characterization of the NRM of post-impac t sediments as well as suevite, impact melt rocks, and basement target rocks within the peak ring of the crater. This objective wa s achieved by conducting measurements of the NRM and limited alternating field (AF) demagnetization (up to either 15 or $20~\mathrm{mT}$ ) o f discrete paleomagnetic specimens collected at a minimum frequency of ${\sim}1$ sample per $3\,\mathrm{m}$ spanning the entire length of the Expedition 364 core.  

The post-impact sedimentary column typically had NRM intensities between $1\times10^{-10}$ and $8\,\times\,10^{-9}\ \mathrm{Am^{2}}$ (for sample volumes o f ${\sim}12.25~\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ ). The majority of sediment samples carried a norma l polarity magnetic overprint that represents either viscous contamination from the geomagnetic field, drilling-induced magnetization, or some combination thereof. Because this magnetic overprint wa s not fully removed by AF demagnetization to $15{-}20~\mathrm{mT}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , the underlying detrital remanent magnetization could not be properly characterized during the expedition. Therefore, attempts to produce  a polarity magnetostratigraphy and age model from the sedimentar y column will be reserved for postexpedition analyses, when AF demagnetization to field levels higher than $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ are permitted.  

Suevite and impact melt rocks within the core dominantly hav e NRMs of reversed polarity with a mean inclination value of approximately $-44^{\circ}$ . Some breccia samples exhibit a normal polarity magnetization of inclination of approximately $38^{\circ}$ that  was  likel y acquired after the impact. Both of these observations are consisten t with prior paleomagnetic investigations of these lithologies in othe r locations within the Chicxulub crater. NRM intensities of the suevite are 3–4 orders of magnitude higher than those of the post-impact sediments. The impact melt rocks have the highest NR M values in the entire core, ranging between $\sim\!2\times10^{-5}$ and ${\sim}2\times10^{-4}$ $\mathrm{Am^{2}}$ .  

Basement rocks within the core, which are primarily graniti c and intruded by dikes, often have two magnetization components. For the vast majority of basement samples, NRM exhibits negativ e inclinations that are broadly consistent with the expected inclination at the time of the impact, which took place during reversed polarity Chron 29R. However, after AF demagnetization to $20\;\mathrm{mT}_{:}$ , th e residual moment often exhibits a positive inclination. The NRMs o f basement target rocks range between ${\sim}3\times10^{-8}$ and ${\sim}4\times10^{-5}\ \mathrm{Am}^{2}$ .  

# Age model summary  

Seventeen foraminifer and nannoplankton biostratigraphic datums were identified at Site M0077. Paleomagnetic reversal datum s are excluded from the age model because of pervasive overprinting. The age-depth plot reveals that sedimentation rates vary widel y throughout the section. The Eocene is characterized by high sedimentation rates, averaging $2.3\ \mathrm{cm/ky},$ , whereas the Paleocene i s characterized by very low sedimentation rates, averaging 0.2 2 $\mathrm{{cm/ky.}}$  

The age model was applied to shipboard dry bulk density data t o generate mass accumulation rates for Site M0077, including rate s for organic carbon and bulk carbonate deposition. In general, organic carbon accumulation is highest in the younger Eocene sectio n after rising from nearly zero at the base of the Eocene section; carbonate mass accumulation rate is generally high throughout bu t also increases from the base of the Eocene section to a peak aroun d $50\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

# Geochemistry  

Composition and abundance of major, minor, and trace elements, including carbon species and sulfur, and modal mineralogical compositions were measured on 246 samples from Expeditio n 364 cores. Samples were divided into three groups according to th e lithostratigraphic division of the transected interval: (1) post-impact sediments, (2) suevite and impact melt rock, and (3) graniti c basement. We analyzed 34 samples from the post-impact sectio n from Cores 3R through 39R (506.2–604.3 mbsf), 50 samples fro m the impact breccia section from Cores 40R through 95R (619.4– 744.1 mbsf), and 163 samples from the granitic section from Core s 96R through 272R (747.89–1237.03 mbsf).  

Post-impact sediments are dominated by $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ with low $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ content expressed as limestones, marlstones, and black shales. Th e upper post-impact sediment section is strongly enriched in organi c carbon, which drops to very low concentrations in the lowermost 2 0 m of this unit. Details of XRF linescan and $\mathrm{{uXRF}}$ mapping of Section 40R-1 show localized enrichments in Ni and $_\mathrm{Cr}$ near th e boundary between limestones and suevite. This boundary als o shows a significant change in composition from calcium carbonate– dominated to silicate-dominated lithologies. The suevite and impact melt rock section from 619.4 to 744.1 mbsf can be divided int o three subsections based on the homogeneity and compositions o f sample intervals. An upper subsection of suevite is characterized b y a relatively homogeneous composition, which is succeeded by  a lower suevite section that exhibits pronounced scatter in the determined elemental concentrations. The impact melt rock section a t the bottom of the suevite lacks the high carbonate content of th e two suevite sections above and shows higher content of silicate mineral component–derived element concentrations, such as Si, Al, K,  

Na, V, Rb, and Zr. Organic carbon contents are very low in the suevite and impact melt rock section, and total carbon contents ar e dominated by carbonate carbon.  

The granitic basement section shows relatively homogeneou s concentrations of major, minor, and trace elements that are dominated by $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ but yielded surprisingly low total concentrations. Th e monotonous granitic chemical character is punctuated throughou t the section by intercalations of suevite, impact melt rocks, and subvolcanic rocks that display variable compositional characteristics. Generally, total organic carbon concentrations are similarly low i n the granitic basement section compared to the suevite and impac t melt rock section; however, carbonate-related carbon contents ar e markedly lower.  

# Physical properties  

Physical property measurements were acquired from all core s recovered during Expedition 364. Offshore measurements wer e taken on whole-round cores (gamma density, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and natural gamma ray), and onshore measurements were taken on half-round cores (color reflectance an d thermal conductivity) and on discrete samples $P.$ -wave velocity an d moisture and density). Measurements are overall of good qualit y and reflect the different lithostratigraphic units. $P.$ -wave velocity, resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and natural gamma ray were measured both on cores and downhole, and the two data sets correlat e well (Figure F12).  

In the post-impact sediments, porosities decrease with depth, densities and $P$ -wave velocities increase, and magnetic susceptibility and natural gamma ray remain relatively constant with low values.  

In the upper peak ring, $P$ -wave velocities and densities are lo w compared to the overlying post-impact sediments, but both properties increase with depth. An opposite trend is observed for porosities. The post-impact sediment to peak ring contact is marked by a n abrupt increase in the magnetic susceptibility and natural gamm a ray signals.  

Finally, in the lower peak-ring rocks, $P$ -wave velocities increas e with depth, with local excursions associated with dikes. Overall, densities remain constant except for local abrupt changes in th e dikes or in the lowermost ${100}\,\mathrm{m}$ of the hole, where values decrease. Porosity values remain constant through the lower peak-ring rock s and start increasing in the lowermost $100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of the hole. Natura l gamma ray and magnetic susceptibility are constant overall in th e lower peak-ring rocks, with clear positive or negative excursions i n the dikes.  

# Downhole logging  

The set of downhole geophysical tools used during Expeditio n 364 was determined by the scientific objectives, drilling/corin g technique, hole conditions, and temperature at the drill site durin g operations.  

Wireline logging and VSP data were acquired in three loggin g phases: upper interval at ${\sim}0{-}503\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF, middle interval at $\mathord{\sim}506-$ $699\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, and lower interval at $700{-}1334\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. In the lower interval, wireline logs were acquired in two steps to avoid an interva l of potential hole instability (mud circulation loss zones), identifie d as Lower A $939\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF to total depth) and Lower B $(935{-}701\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF) intervals (Figure F13). The following measurements were acquired in three stages using slimline tools: spectral and total gamm a radiation, sonic velocity, acoustic and optical borehole images, electrical resistivity, induction conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, caliper, borehole fluid parameters, and seismic traveltime versu s depth from the VSP (Figures F13, F14). Logs were recorded eithe r with standalone logging tools or with stackable tools, combined int o tool strings, which were lowered into the hole after completion o f coring operations over a given interval. For the first time in IODP, Expedition 364 deployed stackable slimline probes.  

The majority of measurements were performed in open borehole conditions (no casing). The recovery and overall quality of th e downhole logging data are good due to the excellent borehole conditions (Figure F13), although some of the logs have a poorer qualit y in the upper part of the hole $\left\langle{\sim}0{-}400\mathrm{~m~}\right.$ wireline log depth belo w seafloor [WSF]) due to a wider diameter and imperfect borehol e conditions. At the scale of the borehole, resistivity and sonic logs ar e well correlated, as expected. The wireline logs are also in goo d agreement with the physical properties data acquired both o n whole-round cores and on discrete samples (Figure F12).  

In the post-impact sediments $(0{-}616.7\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{WSF})$ , resistivity fro m induction log (Res from IL) gives a mean value of $1.2\;\Omega\mathrm{m}$ , mean $P_{-}$ - wave sonic velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ is $2800\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ (below $460\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ ), and magnetic susceptibility is low, $<\!30\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ , as expected in carbonates. The character of the gamma ray log changes downhole with a majo r step in the base level at ${\sim}274\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF, with a mean value around 10 0 API in the upper interval and of ${\sim}30$ API in the lower one. The transition to suevite is found at $616.7\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ and characterized by  a major change in the wireline log properties observed ${\sim}0.65~\mathrm{cm}$ below, at $617.35\mathrm{~m}\,\mathrm{WSF},$ , and illustrated by a sharp downhole decreas e in $P$ -wave sonic velocities and induction resistivity and an increas e in gamma ray.  

In the upper peak-ring interval $\left(616.7{-}746.2\mathrm{~m~}\right.$ WSF), a clea r change in log pattern is observed at ${\sim}705.5\,\mathrm{m}$ WSF, ${\sim}17\,\mathrm{m}$ above th e top of the impact melt rock found in cores at 722 mbsf. From ${\sim}616$ to $705.5\mathrm{~m~WSF}_{}$ in the suevite, the logs show low variability. Th e induction resistivity log gives an average value of ${\sim}2.6\,\Omega\mathrm{m}$ . Resistivity and sonic logs follow the same trend. Average sonic $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity is ${\sim}2900\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . Magnetic susceptibility is low, below $260\times10^{-5}$ SI. The gamma ray log shows low variability with an average of 8 0 API. From ${\sim}705.5\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF to the base of the impact melt rock a t $746.2~\mathrm{m}$ WSF, the wireline logs show much higher variability compared to the suevite above. The average resistivity is $3.6\;\Omega\mathrm{m}$ and th e average sonic $P.$ -wave velocity is ${\sim}3900\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s},$ , ${\sim}1\mathrm{,}000\,\mathrm{m/s}$ higher tha n the suevite above. Magnetic susceptibility is high with an average o f $1000\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ . The gamma ray log shows values ranging between 3 2 and 260 API. The contact between the impact melt rock and th e basement below is found at $746.2\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF}$ and marked on the wireline logs by a sharp decrease in magnetic susceptibility and an increase in gamma ray.  

In the lower peak-ring interval $(746.2–1334.69\mathrm{~m~WSF})$ ), wireline logs are characterized by moderate to low variability. Mean resistivity is ${\sim}5~\Omega\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{{:}}}$ , and average sonic $P$ -wave velocities are ${\sim}4100$ $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ . Magnetic susceptibility is generally low $_{\leftmoon0.002}$ SI) with increasing values in the impact melt rock and suevite intervals. Gamma ray in the granite provides consistent values of ${\sim}250$ AP I whereas higher values $[>\!400$ API) are observed in the suevite.  

At the borehole scale, the borehole-fluid temperature increase s progressively downhole from ${\sim}26^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $66.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at the base of th e hole, and the borehole fluid conductivity ranges from 55,000 t o $240,\!000\,\upmu\mathrm{S/cm}$ . The measurements were acquired in several phase s shortly after the drilling; hence, fluid parameter logs should only b e used qualitatively. The borehole-fluid temperature likely reflects  a minimum value for the in situ temperature of the formation, whereas borehole conductivity is affected by recent drilling operations and the presence of drill mud and seawater in the hole. Acoustic borehole images are mostly of good quality and should allo w reorientation of the majority of cores with respect to magneti c north. Figure F15 illustrates the deviation of Hole M0077A.  

The three-component VSP is characterized by four major velocity regions, each with velocity increasing with depth (Figure F14). I n the post-impact sediments, the boundary between Zones 1 and 2 i s marked by $300~\mathrm{m/s}$ increase in velocity and $10\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ decrease in velocity uncertainty. An increase in velocity and increase in uncertainty (400 and $17\,\mathrm{m}/\mathbf{s}$ , respectively) are seen at $595\,\mathrm{m}$ WSF with th e transition to suevite. The most prominent velocity increase is see n at the impact melt rock contact and continues in to the granite s with a jump of more than $1100\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ .  

# Microbiology  

Asteroid and comet impacts are known to cause severe disruption to surface biota, as is the case for Chicxulub, but what is thei r effect on the present and ancient deep biosphere, where a large proportion of Earth’s biomass resides? Rock samples from every 3 to  9 m (post-impact sediments) and $9\textrm{m}$ (upper and lower peak ring ) were obtained aseptically directly upon coring and prepared for anaerobic cultivation and cell enumeration as well as for cultivationindependent metagenomic taxonomic and functional diversity profiling. Specific questions that will be addressed for the study of th e present day biosphere follow: How does biomass change wit h depth? Which microbes are there and what are they doing? It is hypothesized that once the impact-induced hydrothermal syste m cooled, conditions improved to support deep subsurface recolonization. The brecciated regions within impact craters are of particular interest because the heavily fractured, brecciated rock is likely t o lead to an increase in fluid flow and the availability of nutrients an d redox couples to microbiota. Another objective is to study the ancient deep biosphere within the recovered core. For this project, w e will explore to what extent ancient plankton DNA can be recovere d from Cenozoic marine sediments overlying the Chicxulub impac t crater and whether this DNA is suitable for study of the post-impac t recovery and development of marine life. In addition, we will explore to what extent slow growing and presumably slowly evolvin g bacteria and/or archaea in the Cenozoic record can provide information about post-impact environmental and depositional conditions. The parallel analysis of the composition of fossil lipi d biomarkers and their isotopic compositions will provide information about the source and bioavailability of organic matter and provide additional proxies for establishing the paleoenvironmenta l conditions that prevailed at the time of deposition such as trophi c status, euxinia, ocean acidification, changes in hydrological balance, and atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentrations. For example, the paired analysis of more recalcitrant lipid biomarkers could reveal whether lif e has been present in the past in the case that the more labile nuclei c acids and/or microbial cells are below the detection limit.  

# Offshore operations  

All times are reported in Central Daylight Time (CDT).  

# Mobilization of the drilling platform  

Mobilization of the drilling platform, the L/B Myrtle, was undertaken in several phases. The vessel is a liftboat with a shallow draf t and limited sailing weather window (fair weather). The drilling system was to be cantilevered over the bow of the L/B Myrtle, and th e vessel could not sail with the drilling rig in this position. Therefore, it was not possible for the vessel to be fully mobilized until the platform had reached the drill site.  

Between 12 and 13 March 2016, the first mobilization took plac e at the port of Fourchon, Louisiana. The drilling system was source d from DOSECC (Salt Lake City, Utah [USA]), and the containerize d laboratories and downhole logging equipment were brought in fro m various European countries and Canada. All the equipment wa s placed on board, along with the laboratories, offices (including I T and database), and refrigerated and drilling containers. These wer e secured into working positions but not powered, networked, or se t up for operations. The inner part of the cantilever platform, the drill ancillary equipment, and the various drill tubulars were positione d and secured. The outer part of the cantilever, the drill, and the generators were stowed inboard and away from the wash of the bow fo r the transit.  

On 15 March, the L/B Myrtle sailed from Port Fourchon headin g toward Progreso, Mexico, via Brownsville, Texas (USA). This clas s of liftboat is only authorized to sail in water depths it is able to jac k up in, so it took a route around the Gulf of Mexico, passing close t o the coast of the US and Mexico. Poor weather slowed progress t o Brownsville, requiring the L/B Myrtle to halt and jack up several times and wait out the weather.  

On 22 March, the L/B Myrtle arrived at the port of Brownsville, refueled, and cleared customs. Poor weather and technical issue s delayed the departure until 27 March, when the second phase o f transit to the port of Progreso commenced with several more stop s for weather.  

On 4 April, the L/B Myrtle arrived at the port of Progreso. Afte r clearing the formalities of the port, the ESO team and the drill cre w joined at $1500\,\mathrm{h}$ . The cantilever was fitted prior to leaving port because this process is more readily achievable when positioned quayside than when the vessel is jacked up at sea.  

# Transit to Hole M0077A  

At $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 April 2016, after fuel, food, and drilling mud wer e loaded, the $L/B$ Myrtle set sail from the Port of Progreso and heade d for the drill site (Hole M0077A). At $1530\;\mathrm{h}_{!}$ , the L/B Myrtle arrive d on site and prepared to position above the hole.  

At $1544\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 April 2016, the $L/B$ Myrtle was positioned abov e Hole M0077A and the legs were lowered to the seabed. The seabe d was tagged at $1551\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{~}}$ , and the leg preload procedure began. The preload and settlement procedure continued until $0700~\mathrm{h}$ on 6 April, when the L/B Myrtle jacked up to ${\sim}13.1\;\mathrm{m}$ above sea level. Following completion of the required health and safety drill, access to th e working deck was granted and final mobilization of the drilling ri g and ESO laboratories commenced. At $1940\,\mathrm{~h~}$ , the supply vessel Linda $F$ arrived at the platform and delivered drilling mud. Mobilization continued throughout 7 April with a visit from the Linda $F$ a t $1300~\mathrm{h}$ for a vessel crew change and some additional supplies. A t $1900\,\mathrm{h}$ , drilling operations commenced with running the conducto r pipe to the seabed.  

# Hole M0077A  

At $0330~\mathrm{h}$ on 8 April, the conductor pipe reached the seabed , and preparations for open-hole drilling were made. An open-hol e assembly comprising a $12\%$ inch tricone bit was utilized. At $1342\,\mathrm{h}$ , the drill reached the seabed and drilling began. Drill cuttings wer e collected at regular intervals from mud returned to deck via th e temporary guide casing. At $1550~\mathrm{h},$ , a depth of $15.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF wa s reached and the pipe was tripped out to start running the $9\%$ inc h casing into the hole. At $0045\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 April, the conductor casing wa s in place and cement was injected into the hole and allowed to set. A t $1500\;\mathrm{h},$ casing was cut to length and the mud diverter system wa s set up on the drill floor. Next, a $7\%$ inch tricone bit was run in to th e top of the cement, and open-hole drilling commenced with a targe t depth of $500\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. Cuttings were collected from the mud recycling system with every $5\;\mathrm{m}$ advance downhole.  

Drilling continued on 10 April at a rate of approximately $8\;\mathrm{m/h}$ Between 82 and $101\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, mud circulation was lost and, followin g attempts to adjust mud composition in order to counteract this loss, the decision to cement the hole was made. Following cementation, $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ were allowed for the cement to cure. At $0000~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 April, pipe was run in, and at $0435~\mathrm{h}$ , drilling of the cement plug at $82\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF commenced. Despite a further loss of circulation in this section, drilling progressed, reaching a depth of $229\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF by $2400\,\mathrm{{h}}$ During 12 April, the supply vessel visited the $L/B$ Myrtle once again, delivering ESO personnel, logging engineers, food, and fuel.  

Drilling continued during 13 April, achieving target depth fo r open-hole drilling at $503~\mathrm{m}$ DSF at $2153~\mathrm{h}$ . The remainder of Apri l 13 was spent pulling out of the hole and preparing for downhol e logging operations and vertical seismic profiling.  

At $0955\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 April, test firing of the air gun occurred, accompanied by appropriate marine mammal and protected species observation. At $1015~\mathrm{h},$ , the supply vessel arrived and ESO personne l and members of the Science Party joined the $L/B$ Myrtle.  

At $1300~\mathrm{h}$ , wireline logging commenced. By $1600~\mathrm{h}$ , all loggin g tools were recovered to deck to ensure VSP operations were carrie d out in daylight. The VSP continued until $2330~\mathrm{h}$ and was precede d and accompanied by appropriate mammal and protected specie s observations. The VSP was recovered at $2400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 April, and th e setup for wireline logging commenced. Logging operations continued throughout 16 April until $1400\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

Following this, the drill string was tripped and casing was ru n into the hole. Running casing continued until $2400\,\mathrm{h}_{:}$ , during whic h difficulties with connecting the casing were noted. In order to asses s the condition of the casing, downhole logging was carried out a t $0215~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 April. This process included running the EM51 an d the QL40-SGR (spectral gamma) $^+$ QL40-ABI40 (acoustic televiewer) tool string. Based on the results, it was considered possibl e to continue casing by connecting two pipes downhole, and the ful l depth of the open hole was cased by $2000\,\mathrm{h}$ . Following this, the hol e was cemented and left to cure.  

On 17 April at $1300\;\mathrm{h},$ running of pipe commenced to remov e cement from the base of the hole and start coring. Cement was encountered at a shallower depth than anticipated, and at $1820\;\mathrm{h},$ th e core barrel became stuck. After attempts to free the core barrel, th e string was tripped at $2000\,\mathrm{h}$ . This process continued until $0040\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 18 April, when the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) was recovered t o deck. The rubber bung used to push the cement was caught in th e BHA and identified as the obstruction preventing further progress. After changing out the BHA, pipe was run back into the hole. However, an obstruction was again encountered at the same depth (30 7 m DSF) where the casing was reconnected downhole, indicating potential misalignment of the casing. At $0825\ \mathrm{h},$ it was necessary t o once again trip the pipe in order to add a reaming bit to the BHA s o that milling and reaming could be carried out to advance throug h the casing. Running in of pipe recommenced at $1500\,\mathrm{h},$ and at 071 0 h on 19 April, the milling and reaming assembly reached the base o f the hole and was tripped out to make preparations for coring.  

At $1315\ \mathrm{h}$ on 19 April, the coring assembly was prepared an d running in pipe recommenced. At $2020\,\mathrm{h}$ , the BHA was recovere d for inspection and was then de-latched and sent back to the botto m of the hole. Due to lack of progress, the string was again tripped ou t at $2043~\mathrm{h}$ . A modification was made, with a fabricated “stinger ” added to the BHA to guide it past the misaligned casing. This assembly was run in at $0345~\mathrm{h}$ on 20 April. By $0655~\mathrm{h},$ the BHA ha d passed the misaligned casing and progressed to the base of the hole, where coring commenced. At $1055~\mathrm{h},$ , the barrel was recovered t o deck. It contained debris material associated with the drilling process (metal and rubber). A second core barrel was deployed and rotated for approximately $30\ \mathrm{min}$ with no advance. On recovery t o deck, this barrel was found to be empty. Following discussion, it wa s decided to fish for any further pieces of metal (thought to be crown s from a damaged bit) which could be down the hole. Attempts to remove debris and advance coring were made throughout the day.  

On 21 April, attempts to remove debris continued until $1415\,\mathrm{h}$ when essential maintenance to the rig was carried out. Maintenanc e of the rig continued throughout the day until $0710\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 April. Fo r the remainder of the day, attempts to clear the borehole of debri s continued. At $2330\,\mathrm{h}$ after no advancement, the pipe was tripped t o change the bit.  

Tripping of pipe continued until $1155~\mathrm{h}$ when the BHA was recovered on deck. A tricone bit was added to the BHA to drill ope n hole past the obstruction. Shortly afterward, the Linda $F$ arrived t o transfer personnel to the platform. Running in pipe continued, an d at $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ , open-hole drilling commenced. By $2120\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , $505.70\;\mathrm{m}$ DS F had been reached, advancing the hole beyond the debris/obstruction.  

Tripping of the pipe commenced and continued into 24 Apri l until $0215\ \mathrm{h},$ when the BHA was recovered to deck and the bi t changed to allow coring. The pipe was run in and reached the bas e of the hole at $0730\,\mathrm{h},$ , when coring commenced. The first core, Cor e 1R, was recovered to deck at $0800\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . Coring then continue d throughout 24 April with a total of nine runs, reaching $521.67\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF.  

During the early hours of 25 April, it was necessary to carry ou t maintenance on the top drive motors, resulting in a break in corin g until $0505\,\mathrm{h}$ . Cores 10R and 11R were recovered at 0650 and $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ respectively, before further rig maintenance was required. Corin g then progressed smoothly throughout 25 April, reaching $546.09\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF by $2400\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

The supply boat arrived at $1600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 April to deliver groceries  and  other  supplies.  Smooth  coring  operations  continue d throughout 26–28 April, recovering a total of 41 cores (17R–58R), all of which were high quality, maintaining core diameter with fe w breaks and high recovery. The total distance advanced over this period was $128.1\;\mathrm{m}$ to $674.19\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF.  

At $0500~\mathrm{h}$ on 29 April, after recovering Cores 59R and 60R , changes in drilling parameters were recorded and the pipe wa s tripped to assess the condition of the BHA and drill string. On recovery, the bit was worn and was therefore changed before runnin g in commenced. Coring started at $2300\,\mathrm{h}$ , and Core 61R was recovered to deck by $2355\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

Coring continued throughout 30 April. Due to a change in lithology and in order to optimize recovery, core runs were shortened t o ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{m}$ on average and the coring rate was reduced. By the end o f the day, a total of 11 core runs (Cores 62R–72R) were completed, advancing the hole $15.75\:\mathrm{m}$ and reaching $699.09\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Core recovery averaged $81\%$ .  

On 1 May, essential maintenance of the rig was carried out fo r the majority of the morning. Once complete, the core barrel was recovered to deck, and it was found that the core catcher contained  a “stub” of core, probably left behind by the previous run (Core 72R).  

A decision was made to trip the pipe the step down to standard PQ 3 drill string, allowing the next phase of the downhole logging program to commence.  

Set up for logging commenced, and the pipe was tripped to 50 7 m DSF, just below the depth of casing, to enable open-hole logging.  

Logging operations continued for the remainder of the day, an d logging personnel were transferred to the platform on the Linda $F$ . The first tool run downhole was the induction magnetic susceptibility standalone tool, followed by a tool string comprising the spectra l natural gamma ray, sonic, and fluid and temperature conductivit y tools, run from $\mathord{\sim}698$ to $507~\mathrm{m}$ WSF. Toward the end of the day,  a tool string comprising the spectral natural gamma ray tool, caliper, and acoustic borehole imager was sent down the hole. Downhol e logging operations continued during the early hours of 2 May. Th e tool string, as outlined above, was run uphole from ${\sim}697\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF a t very high resolution. While rig-up for VSP operations was ongoing, marine mammal and protected species observations were carrie d out. Following technical issues with the depth encoder, the VSP too l was lowered to $696\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{WSF}$ and run uphole at a high resolution. Marine mammal and protected species observation continued durin g and after VSP operations. Upon completion of downhole loggin g operations, maintenance of the drill rig continued for the remainde r of the day. The Linda $F$ arrived, and logging personnel disembarked. On 3 May, maintenance of the drill rig was complete and running in pipe began. The base of the hole was reached at $0325\,\mathrm{h}$ , an d  

coring commenced. On recovery of Core 73R, fragments of the dril l bit were found in the core liner, indicating the bit had worn i n places. The pipe was therefore tripped to recover the BHA for inspection. Following discussion, the decision was made to case an d cement the borehole and step down to a standard PQ3 size dril l string to improve coring efficiency. Casing of the hole started an d continued through the remainder of the day. The total dept h reached using oversized PQ3 size drill string was $701.64\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. During the day, the Linda $F$ arrived to transfer supplies and personnel.  

Running casing continued until $0510~\mathrm{h}$ on 4 May. The casin g was set by pumping cement to the base of the hole and allowing u p to $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ to cure. To maximize operational time while the cement wa s curing, a wireline tool sting comprising the natural gamma ray too l and acoustic imager was sent downhole. Upon completion of th e downhole logging exercise, the drill string was run into the hole i n preparation for coring; this continued for the remainder of the day.  

Running pipe continued until $0230~\mathrm{h}$ on the morning of 5 May. Upon reaching the base of the hole, coring of the cement began wit h a cement core being recovered at $0329\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . Coring continue d throughout the day and was intermittently interrupted to carry ou t essential maintenance on the drill rig. Coring runs were kept shor t to maximize recovery in challenging lithologies. A total of seve n cores were recovered throughout the day, advancing the hole by 5. 7 m. Core recovery was $100\%$ , and quality was good. By midnight, coring reached $707.34\mathrm{~m~DSF}$ and continued.  

On 6 May, coring continued throughout the day, with a total o f nine cores recovered. The recovery rate was an improvement on th e previous day, and the quality of the core was very high. The hole wa s advanced by $21.35\;\mathrm{m},$ , reaching $728.69\:\mathrm{m}$ DSF.  

Coring continued with rates continuing to increase as the lithology became more competent. The recovery and quality of the core s remained high, and the hole was advanced by $24.40~\mathrm{m}$ to $753.09\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF by the end of 7 May.  

Coring continued to progress throughout 8 May. In general, th e recovery and quality of core remained high. The only exception wa s while drilling Core 99R, when the bit became blocked, and as a result, a short run was recovered. The core was blocked in the tub e with many fractured pieces and was difficult to extract. However, following this, coring resumed with excellent recovery rates an d high-quality cores collected. A total of 11 cores were collected, reaching $783.59\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF.  

The high-quality recovery continued throughout 9 May. Whil e running Cores 117R and 119R, the bit became blocked again, whic h resulted in shorter core runs. All other cores were full $3.05~\mathrm{m}$ runs, with a total of $28.35\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered from 11 cores.  

Coring continued throughout the morning of 10 May. Whil e drilling Core 123R, a loss of circulation was noted at ${\sim}821\mathrm{~m~}$ DS F $.\sim\!5\%$ mud loss). As a result, loss circulation material was pumpe d down the hole followed by drilling mud, which resolved the issue, and coring resumed. Following several unsuccessful attempts t o core, the drill string was tripped to recover a suspected worn bit. The BHA was recovered at $1544\;\mathrm{h},$ and the worn bit was replaced. The pipe was then run back in, and coring recommenced at $2145\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

Two cores of excellent quality and $100\%$ recovery were recovered by $0340~\mathrm{h}$ on 11 May. Following this, several attempts wer e made to core further, but there was no advancement. A decision wa s made to trip the drill string, commencing at $0850\;\mathrm{h},$ in order to inspect the BHA. The BHA was recovered, and the bit was replaced. Pipe was run back into the hole, and coring recommenced at $2010\,\mathrm{h}$ . However, the core run was short because the bit blocked off due t o a crumpled liner. As coring continued, the hole depth at midnigh t measured $830.09\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF, an advance of $6.85\mathrm{~m~}$ from the previou s day.  

Coring initially progressed slowly without interruption on 1 2 May. Four cores were recovered during the morning (by 1155 h) an d a further three during the afternoon. The cores continued to be hig h quality, and a $100\%$ recovery rate was achieved. The day finishe d with the hole advanced by a further $17.30\;\mathrm{m}$ to $847.54\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF.  

On 13 May, coring continued from the previous day. While coring Core 136R, the barrel became blocked, and the run was recovered early. Despite torque remaining steady and mud flow constant, no penetration was made on a further attempt to core, and it wa s concluded that the bit was worn. As a result, the majority of th e morning and early afternoon was spent tripping out/in the hole an d replacing the bit (0400–1230 h). Coring commenced at $1230\,\mathrm{h}$ wit h short $(0.4{-}0.7\,\mathrm{m})$ cores recovered initially. The final two cores of th e day (140R and 141R) were recovered following full runs, measurin g $3.10\;\mathrm{m}$ each. The final hole depth at midnight was $859.54\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF.  

At $0000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 May, a motor change on the rig was carried ou t during shift changeover, and coring recommenced at $_{0055}\,\mathrm{h}$ . Corin g continued steadily throughout the day, with a total of 11 cores collected, which advanced the hole depth by a further $30.80~\mathrm{m}$ . Thes e cores were very high quality with $100\%$ recovery. The hole depth a t the end of the day was $890.34\:\mathrm{m}$ DSF.  

On 15 May, coring continued with high-quality cores retrieve d at a recovery rate of $100\%$ . Rig maintenance (repair to a hydrauli c hose) was required prior to the recovery of Core 156R at $^{0720\mathrm{~h~}}$ . Once complete, coring recommenced at $0855~\mathrm{h}$ and continued fo r the remainder of the day. At the end of the day, the hole depth wa s $926.94\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF with a total of 14 cores $\left(36.60\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ recovered.  

Coring continued throughout the day on 16 May. The change s in formation slowed progress for short periods of time, and a los s circulation zone caused a small delay in drilling as loss circulatio n material was prepared and delivered downhole. However, due t o continued loss of mud, a higher ratio of water to mud was adopte d to preserve the mud supply. Cores were again of extremely hig h quality with $100\%$ recovery and a steadily improving coring rate. B y the end of the day, 14 cores totaling $36.60\mathrm{~m~}$ had been collected, which advanced the hole depth to $963.54\mathrm{~m~DSF}$ .  

The coring rate continued to increase throughout 17 May with  a total of 17 cores $(51.85\;\mathrm{m})$ recovered over the $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ period, taking th e hole depth to $1015.39\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Due to a continued loss of circulatio n relating to issues from the previous day, water and dilute mud wer e used to flush the drill cuttings.  

On 18 May, coring continued without any stoppages: 15 core s were collected $^{42.13\mathrm{~m~}}$ in length), furthering the hole depth t o $1057.52\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Toward the end of the day, issues were noted wit h the barrel failing to latch in. Once latched in and lowered to ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{cm}$ from the base of the hole, pressure increased to an unworkable leve l (300–500 psi) while torque remained low (less than 1000 psi). It wa s concluded that the bit had worn, and as a result, the majority of th e late morning and early afternoon on 19 May was spent tripping pip e out of the hole. The bit was then replaced, and coring recommence d at $1415\ \mathrm{h},$ producing high-quality cores with $100\%$ recovery. Th e day ended with a hole depth of $1075.92\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF, following the retrieval of six cores measuring $18.40\;\mathrm{m}$ in total.  

Coring continued uninterrupted throughout 20 May. Core s were excellent quality, and $100\%$ recovery was achieved. The da y ended at $1121.64\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF, having drilled $45.72\textrm{m}$ in total. Corin g continued to progress without any maintenance stoppages throughout 21 May (ending at $1166.19\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, having drilled $44.50\ \mathrm{m}^{\phantom{\dagger}}$ ) an d into 22 May.  

Coring continued throughout $22\,\mathrm{\textrm{May}}$ with excellent qualit y cores with close to $100\%$ recovery. The day ended at $1215.24\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, having drilled $49.05\;\mathrm{m}$ (16 individual cores).  

Coring continued from the previous day, and progressed uninterrupted throughout 23 May. Cores were excellent quality, an d $100\%$ recovery was achieved. The day ended at $1255.54\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF, having advanced the hole by $40.30\;\mathrm{m}$ (13 cores).  

Throughout 24 May, coring continued uninterrupted. The 1 2 cores collected were consistently high quality, and the day ende d with a hole depth of $1291.29\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF.  

On 25 May, there were no operational issues and coring proceeded continuously with the same high quality and recovery rates. The day ended at $1328.49\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF, having advanced the hole by 37.2 0 m. A total of 12 cores were recovered.  

The final cores of Expedition 364 were collected on 26 May. Th e final two cores collected were again of excellent quality and $100\%$ recovery. The final hole depth for M0077A was $1334.69\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF attained at $0235~\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{m}}$ , having advanced the hole by $6.20\,\mathrm{~m~}$ since midnight.  

With the completion of coring on 26 May, the supply boat Lind a $F$ transferred the Science Party to Progreso, leaving the ESO an d DOSECC staff and Montco crew on board the L/B Myrtle. The hol e was flushed with water, and pipe was pulled in preparation fo r downhole logging activities. Wireline logging tools were run fro m the bottom of the hole ( $1334.69\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF) to ${\sim}940\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF (Lower  A logging interval) at $0740\,\mathrm{h}$ . Initially, the electrical resistivity tool wa s run, followed by a tool string comprising the gamma ray, sonic, an d borehole fluid probes. The acoustic borehole images and calipe r and spectral gamma ray logs were successively acquired betwee n 1620 and $2308\,\mathrm{h}$ . All data were of good quality.  

Downhole logging operations proceeded on 27 May with the acquisition of gamma ray, caliper, and optical images from ${\sim}1046$ t o ${\sim}940\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF because the elevated bottom hole temperature inhibited the tool from working properly at depth. Following the trippin g out of pipe, wireline operations recommenced at $0740\,\mathrm{h}$ with electrical resistivity, followed by a tool string comprising the gamma ray, sonic, and borehole fluid probes. Centralized tools were not ru n across the interval at which mud was lost $\left(\sim\!940\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ to avoid destabilizing the borehole wall. The third tool run at $1143~\mathrm{h}$ consisted o f the gamma ray, caliper, and acoustic imager tool string. At ${\sim}850~\mathrm{m}$ DSF, the borehole diameter expanded beyond the size of the centralizer. The tool string was pulled back to deck at $1612\,\mathrm{h},$ , and centralizers changed for larger ones. After completion of the loggin g phase for the Lower A interval, the magnetic susceptibility and induction standalone tool was run. The tool string containing th e acoustic imager was sent downhole again at $1840~\mathrm{h}$ to image th e ${\sim}940{-}700\mathrm{~m~l~}$ DSF interval. A tool string comprising the gamma ra y tool and fluid temperature probe was then sent to the bottom of th e hole at $2350\,\mathrm{h}$ . All data were of good quality.  

During 28 May, gamma ray and optical imager logs were collected. The tool string arrived back at the drill floor at $0630\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , an d rig-up for VSP commenced. Marine mammal observations commenced in advance of VSP activities and continued throughout. Th e VSP tool was sent to the bottom of the hole, and data acquisitio n began at $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ . Acquisition was completed at $1340\,\mathrm{h},$ and loggin g operations ended, clearing the drill floor at $1530\,\mathrm{h}$ . With the exception of the optical images, all data were of good quality. The recorded optical images were not consistent with the expected facie s variations, likely due to the presence of mud cake. It is likely that th e wider spacing between the borehole wall and casing at this dept h resulted in a reduced fluid velocity when the borehole was flushed, and this condition led to less mud being removed. Once these final operational activities were complete, demobilization commenced a t $1530~\mathrm{h}$ and continued throughout the remainder of the day an d through 29 May.  

On 30 May, the L/B Myrtle successfully jacked down while all personnel were restricted to the uppermost deck in line with safet y protocol. Following a short (approximately $^{3\mathrm{~h~}}$ ) transit, the $L/B$ Myrtle arrived at the port of Progreso and the remaining crew (DOSECC and ESO staff) disembarked, ending the offshore operational phase of Expedition 364.  

The cores, contained within the reefer (refrigerated container) , continued onto Port Fourchon, Louisiana, onboard the L/B Myrtle (via US customs in Brownsville), arriving on 13 June. The reefer wa s unloaded on 14 June and was delivered to Weatherford Laboratorie s (Houston, TX [USA]), by truck on 15 June where the cores underwent CT scanning. Following completion of the CT scanning, th e cores were repacked into the reefer and transported from Housto n to the Port of Houston by truck on 13 July. Between 16 July and  6 August, the reefer was transported by ship to Bremerhaven, Germany. On 9 August, the reefer arrived at Bremen Core Repository, MARUM (Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University o f Bremen, Germany), in advance of the Onshore Science Party.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

The goals of Expedition 364 in drilling the peak ring of th e Chicxulub impact crater included achieving some specific tasks: t o determine the nature and composition of the peak-ring rocks; to record the sedimentology and stratigraphy of the Paleocene–Eocen e Chicxulub impact basin infill; to report the chronology of the postimpact fill, peak-ring rocks, and impact lithologies; to measure th e petrophysical properties downhole and on the core; and to use thes e data to calibrate geophysical models.  

We recovered core through the peak-ring rocks and found the m to comprise fractured granitic basement covered by impact mel t rock and suevite. The post-impact interval comprises a mix of lithologies, including marlstones, claystones, limestones, siltstones, an d black shales, constrained biostratigraphically to be deposited between ${\sim}49$ and $65.5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . Samples were taken for postexpedition research to perform Ar/Ar and U/Pb dating. A suite of wireline log s and multisensor core logger data was acquired; these data will no w be used to groundtruth and improve geophysical models of the crater.  

Additionally, the Expedition 364 goals can be grouped into thre e sets of key questions. These include questions surrounding the $\mathrm{K}{\mathrm{-}}\mathrm{Pg}$ extinction event and recovery of life, the subsurface habitability o f impact craters, and the processes that form peak rings and weake n target rocks during large impacts.  

In terms of the linkage between the Chicxulub impact and th e end-Cretaceous mass extinction event, three key questions are wha t caused the environmental changes that led to a global mass extinction? What insights arise from biologic recovery in the Paleogene, within a potentially “toxic” ocean basin? And, can we constrain th e volume of dust and climatically active gases released into the stratosphere by this impact using the recovered cores? Additionally, w e sought to recover the climate signature of particular warm interval s within the post-impact sediments and generally investigate the infilling of the Chicxulub impact basin. The clast lithology within th e suevites that make up the upper peak ring can be examined for evidence of depth of exhumation that may provide insight into volatil e contribution to the atmosphere by the impact event. The lower Paleocene is relatively condensed but complete, with fossils indicativ e of planktonic Biozones P0 to P4. These initial results suggest that w e will be able to address questions about the recovery of life in th e ocean basin and directly compare the recovery with the evolvin g ocean chemistry. Nannofossils indicate that the PETM is present a t Site M0077 bracketed by unconformities, and the Eocene sectio n above is relatively thick.  

In terms of the deep biosphere within the impact crater, we as k what effect does a large impact have on the deep subsurface biosphere, and can impacts generate habitats for chemosynthetic life ? How long did an impact-induced hydrothermal system exist, an d what is the relationship between hydrothermal processes and habitability of the impact crater? Cell counts and DNA in the peak-rin g rocks indicate the presence of modern microbial life, suggesting impact breccias provide an ecological niche. This possibility is now being confirmed with additional tests. Hydrothermal minerals ar e commonly observed in the peak-ring rocks, demonstrating that hydrothermal processes were active after this impact.  

Lastly, in the study of impact processes generally, we ask how ar e rocks weakened during large impacts to allow them to collapse an d form relatively wide, flat craters? What rocks comprise a topographic peak ring, and how are peak rings formed? The fact that th e peak ring is formed from uplifted, shocked, fractured basemen t rocks that overlie Mesozoic sediments (as observed in seismic reflection data) demonstrates that the dynamic collapse model fo r peak-ring formation is substantially correct (Morgan et al., 2016). Deformation of the peak-ring rocks includes brittle fractures, cataclasites, and pervasive shearing with slickensides that often crosscu t each other. These observations will be used to address the kinematics of peak-ring formation and the weakening mechanism that governs impact crater formation during large impacts. The physica l properties of these rocks demonstrate that the impact process reduces the density and velocity of target rocks and greatly enhance s porosity. Additionally, peak rings can be viewed as sampling lithologies present within the crustal column, thus providing insight i n planetary crustal composition using remote sensing.  

In summary, the nearly $100\%$ core recovery, high quality of th e recovered core, completeness of the early Paleocene, and the successful wireline logging campaign at Site M0077 represent a grea t success. We are confident that the data acquired during Expeditio n 364 will accomplish the goals of the expedition and go a significan t way toward answering the many questions posed about the impac t crater, the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, and the effects of impacts on the deep biosphere.  

# Outreach and communication  

The overall aim of the ESO Outreach and Education effort is t o promote the benefits of each expedition’s science, and the wider objectives of ECORD/IODP, to a broad audience, including the scienc e community and public. To accomplish this objective, we focused o n publicizing the expedition’s aims and findings to international media and concentrated on media networks developed within th e IODP/ECORD community and members of the Science Party’s organizations. The approach is described in the Expedition Communications  Plan,  which  was  prepared  by  the  ESO  Outreac h Managers, Co-Chief Scientists, and Expedition Project Manager, and distributed to all Science Party members prior to the expedition.  

Targeted activities in support of the communication objective s included the following:  

• The expedition web page on the ECORD website with links to documents such as the initial proposal and Scientific Prospectus. During the expedition, the website acts as a source of information from the offshore platform by including Ship Reports and blogs. A section on outreach provides links to the expedition materials and a media pack with information about press conferences and media releases, as well as contact details to arrange interviews with the expedition scientists.   
• Expedition promotional materials, including an expedition logo, flier (in both English and Spanish), and branded items such as memory sticks, caps, T-shirts, and mugs for the Science Party members, ESO staff, and ship’s crew.   
• Banners with logos of ECORD, IODP, and ICDP and the expedition logo to display on the side of the offshore platform and onboard to act as a backdrop for interviews. Widespread use of lo  
gos ensures recognition in photographs/videos.   
• Contact with media officers at the Science Party member’s universities to raise awareness of their staff’s participation in the expedition and to enlist their support in promoting the expedition locally and nationally.   
• Engagement with the international media prior to the expedition and support for the organization of radio/media interviews.   
• Organization of a media briefing at the start of the expedition in collaboration with the expedition’s Mexican Scientific Coordinator, Professor Jaime Urrutia-Fucugauchi, expedition scientists Dr. Mario Rebolledo-Vieyra and Dr. Ligia Perez-Cruz, and communications staff at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma De México. The event was held at El Gran Museo del Mundo Maya in Mérida, Mexico, on 13 April 2016, where questions were put to Sean Gulick, Claire Mellett, Jaime Urrutia-Fucugauchi, Ligia Pérez-Cruz, Ricardo Bello Bolio, Director of Higher Education, Yucatan, and Eduardo Batliori Sampedro, Secretary of Urban Development and Environment. The media conference was at  

tended by about 40 media representatives, mainly from Mexican radio, TV, and print media; therefore, the event was conducted in both Spanish and English. The expedition received global interest and was reported in the US, Canada, Australia, and Mexico and in several countries in Europe and Asia. Interest in the expedition and the proximity of the platform to the Mexican coast led to a number of visits by media representatives and VIPs to the platform during the offshore phase of the expedition. A media day was organized on 23 April, when 24 media representatives/VIPs were able to visit the platform.  

• The expedition was the first since the Arctic Coring Expedition (302) in 2004 to involve Education Officers both during the onshore and offshore phase. Educator and children’s author Kevin Kurtz took part in both the onshore and offshore expedition and organized a Reddit AMA (Ask me Anything) event on 13 May in collaboration with the US Science Support Program (USSSP) and the University of Texas at Austin (USA; 2800 participants and 400 comments and questions). A Reddit AMA session was also organized for the onshore party, which took place on $10\,\mathrm{Oc}.$ - tober with more than 2000 participants and during which around 300 questions were asked.   
• Teacher Barbara Matyssek and Kevin Kurtz contributed to the expedition blog and organized educational activities during a 2- week stay at the Onshore Science Party in Bremen. Matyssek conducted short interviews with eight scientists to be published on the ECORD website; questions dealt with the expedition’s perspectives and the scientists’ career paths. Kurtz arranged remote live events in the core repository for student groups and school classes. A total of 33 school classes and groups (1400 participants), mainly from the USA and Europe, took part in 26 sessions. As a long-term project, Matyssek and Kurtz will update a poster to be shown with $\mathrm{K-Pg}$ core replicas.   
• A second media event was held during the Onshore Science Party on 11 October at MARUM and featured short presentations by the Co-Chief Scientists followed by interviews and tours of the laboratory facilities and core repository. The event was attended by representatives from Deutschlandfunk, Radio Bremen, Kreiszeitung, Planet Erde, and the BBC. The scientists’ universities and institutions picked up the press release and published individual versions that resulted in features by various international media. Articles were published in newspapers and on online portals in the US, Mexico, Australia, Japan, and Europe (e.g., Austria, Germany, and the UK).   
• Regular promotion of the expedition's accomplishments were posted on ECORD’s social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. The ESO Outreach Facebook page reached an average of 2,000 visitors per day, peaking at 20,000 visitors on 7 May.   
• An expedition blog (https://esoexpedition364chicxulubimpactcrater.wordpress.com/about) was maintained throughout the expedition (onshore and offshore) and included regular updates from both the offshore and onshore phases of the expedition. The blog received 5,982 views in April 2016 and 10,911 in May 2016, principally from the US, UK, Mexico, Germany, and France.   
• Discussions with a television production company in late 2015 leading to an agreement to grant exclusive access to the expedition to make a TV documentary. A number of television production companies expressed an interest in making documentaries about the expedition, which may be followed up on after the exclusive agreement expires.  

• Journalists working on “Asteroid Day” (http://asteroidday.org) asked British astronaut Tim Peake to take a photograph of the Chicxulub area from the International Space Station during the offshore phase of Expedition 364.  

The expedition outreach efforts were successful in drawing significant international attention to the expedition on television and radio and in the written press.
