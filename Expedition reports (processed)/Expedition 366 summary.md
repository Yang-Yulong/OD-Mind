# Abstract  

Geologic processes at convergent plate margins control geochemical cycling, seismicity, and deep biosphere activity in subduction zones and suprasubduction zone lithosphere. International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 366 was designed to address the nature of these processes in the shallow to intermediate depth of the Mariana subduction channel. Although no technology is available to permit direct sampling of the subduction channel of an intraoceanic convergent margin at depths up to $19\,\mathrm{km}$ , the Mariana forearc region (between the trench and the active volcanic arc) provides a means to access materials from this zone.  

Active conduits, resulting from fractures in the forearc, are prompted by along- and across-strike extension that allows slab-derived fluids and materials to ascend to the seafloor along associated faults, resulting in the formation of serpentinite mud volcanoes. Serpentinite mud volcanoes of the Mariana forearc are the largest mud volcanoes on Earth. Their positions adjacent to or atop fault scarps on the forearc are likely related to the regional extension and vertical tectonic deformation in the forearc. Serpentinite mudflows at these volcanoes include serpentinized forearc mantle clasts, crustal and subducted Pacific plate materials, a matrix of serpentinite muds, and deep-sourced formation fluid. Mud volcanism on the Mariana forearc occurs within $100~\mathrm{km}$ of the trench, representing a range of depths and temperatures to the downgoing plate and the subduction channel. These processes have likely been active for tens of millions of years at the Mariana forearc and for billions of years on Earth.  

At least 19 active serpentinite mud volcanoes have been located in the Mariana forearc. Two of these mud volcanoes are Conical and South Chamorro Seamounts, which are the farthest from the Mariana Trench at 86 and $78~\mathrm{km}$ , respectively. Both seamounts were cored during Ocean Drilling Program Legs 125 and 195, respectively. Data from these two seamounts represent deeper, warmer examples of the continuum of slab-derived materials as the Pacific plate subducts, providing a snapshot of how slab subduction affects fluid release, the composition of ascending fluids, mantle hydration, and the metamorphic paragenesis of subducted oceanic lithosphere. Data from the study of these two mud volcanoes constrain the pressure, temperature, and composition of fluids and materials within the subduction channel at depths of up to $19~\mathrm{km}$ . Understanding such processes is necessary for elucidating factors that control seismicity in convergent margins, tectonic and magma genesis processes in the volcanic arc and backarc areas, fluid and material  fluxes,  and  the  nature  and  variability  of  environmental conditions that impact subseafloor microbial communities.  

Expedition 366 focused on data collection from cores recovered from three serpentinite mud volcanoes that define a continuum of subduction-channel processes to compare with results from drilling at the two previously cored serpentinite mud volcanoes and with previously collected gravity, piston, and remotely operated vehicle push cores across the trench-proximal forearc. Three serpentinite mud volcanoes (Yinazao, Fantangisña, and Asùt Tesoro) were chosen at distances 55 to $72\,\mathrm{km}$ from the Mariana Trench. Cores were recovered from active sites of eruption on their summit regions and on the flanks where ancient flows are overlain by more recent ones.  

Recovered materials show the effects of dynamic processes that ar e active at these sites, bringing a range of materials to the seafloor, including materials from the crust of the Pacific plate, most notabl y subducted seamounts (even corals). Most of the recovered materia l consists of serpentinite mud containing lithic clasts, which are derived from the underlying forearc crust and mantle and the subducting  Pacific  plate.  A  thin  cover  of  pelagic  sediment  wa s recovered at many Expedition 366 sites, and at Site U1498 we core d through distal serpentinite mudflows and into the underlying pelagic sediment and volcanic ash deposits. Recovered serpentinize d ultramafic rocks and mudflow matrix materials are largely unifor m in major element composition, spanning a limited range in $\mathrm{SiO}_{2},$ $M\mathrm{gO},$ and $\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}}$ compositions. However, variation in trace elemen t composition reflects interstitial water composition, which differs a s a function of the temperature and pressure of the underlying subduction channel. Dissolved gases $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ , $\mathrm{CH}_{4},$ and $\mathrm{C_{2}H_{6}}$ are highest a t the site farthest from the trench, which also has the most activ e fluid discharge of the Expedition 366 serpentinite mud volcanoes. These dissolved gases and their active discharge from depth likel y support active microbial communities, which were the focus of indepth subsampling and preservation for shore-based analytical an d culturing procedures. The effects of fluid discharge were also registered in the porosity and gamma ray attenuation density data indicated by higher than expected values at some of the summit sites. These higher values are consistent with overpressured fluids tha t slow compaction of serpentinite mud deposits. In contrast, flan k sites have significantly greater decreases in porosity with depth, suggesting that processes in addition to compaction are required t o achieve the observed data. Thermal measurements reveal highe r heat flow values on the flanks $({\sim}31\mathrm{~mW/m^{2}})$ than on the summit s $({\sim}17\mathrm{~mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2})$ of the seamounts. The new 2G Enterprises superconducting rock magnetometer (liquid helium free) revealed relatively  high  values  of  both  magnetization  and  bulk  magneti c susceptibility of discrete samples related to ultramafic rocks, particularly dunite. Magnetite, a product of serpentinization, and authigenic carbonates were observed in the mudflow matrix materials.  

In addition to coring operations, Expedition 366 focused on th e deployment and remediation of borehole casings for future observatories and set the framework for in situ experimentation. Borehole work commenced at South Chamorro Seamount, where th e original-style CORK was partially removed. Work then continued a t each of the three summit sites following coring operations. Case d boreholes with at least three joints of screened casing were deployed, and a plug of cement was placed at the bottom of each hole. Water samples were collected from two of the three boreholes, revealing significant inputs of formation fluids. This suggests tha t each of the boreholes tapped a hydrologic zone, making these boreholes suitable for experimentation with the future deployment of  a CORK-Lite.  

# Background  

Geologic processes at convergent plate margins affect geochemical cycling and fluxes, seismicity and natural hazards, crustal an d mantle evolution and mixing, and biosphere activity and populatio n dynamics in subduction zones. To constrain these processes, input s and outputs must be quantified. Quantifying inputs into a convergent plate margin is accomplished by sampling the downgoing plat e prior to subduction to provide a geochemical, physical, and mechanical reference. The study of the output in terms of magma an d volatiles in volcanic arcs and in backarc basin settings constrain s processes that occur deep within the subduction zone, but suc h studies of subduction systems are incomplete, lacking an understanding of processes that occur between the time the subductin g plate enters the trench and the time it reaches the zone of magm a genesis beneath the arc. The Mariana convergent system provide s natural windows into this zone.  

The Mariana convergent system is a nonaccretionary-type convergent plate margin (Uyeda and Kanamori, 1979). Here, fluids an d materials rise from the subducted Pacific plate within long-live d permeable pathways through the overlying Philippine plate. Suc h pathways are maintained with across- and along-strike extensio n (Fryer and Salisbury, 2006). Vertical tectonic deformation is anothe r potential process that shapes fault patterns in the forearc. Vertical deformation occurs when Cretaceous Pacific plate guyots are subducted. In contrast, the zone between the trench and the region o f arc magmagenesis is not accessible in accretionary forearcs. Here, deep-sourced fluids ascend through imbricate fault systems an d splays in a thick prism of the accreted sediments. Transit of deepsourced fluids through the prism results in reactions with a compositionally heterogeneous package of sediments, obfuscating th e composition of the deep-sourced fluid. Thus, the Mariana forear c region is unique in the world today in that it provides direct acces s to deep-sourced fluids and material from the subduction channel and suprasubduction zone via active serpentinite mud volcanism. Furthermore, ascending deep-sourced fluids with elevated pH, methane, and hydrogen concentrations relative to seawater suppor t subsurface microbial communities. Such fluids vent at summi t seeps, often supporting megafaunal communities (Fryer, 2012; Ohara et al., 2010).  

Therefore, to study processes in the Mariana forearc we chos e four active serpentinite mud volcanoes (Yinazao, Fantangisña, Asù t Tesoro, and South Chamorro) for investigation during Expeditio n 366 (Figure F1; Table T1). Operations included coring at summi t and flank sites on Yinazao, Fantangisña, and Asùt Tesoro Seamounts; deploying a screened casing for future borehole experiments on the summits of each; and revitalizing the borehol e observatory (CORK) at South Chamorro Seamount (Ocean Drillin g Program [ODP] Site 1200).  

Yinazao Seamount (informally called Blue Moon Seamount) lie s on the eastern edge of a forearc graben about $55\,\mathrm{km}$ from the Mariana Trench axis (Figure F1; Table T1). Of the three mud volcanoe s cored during the expedition, Yinazao Seamount is the closest to th e trench, and the subducting slab lies approximately $13\;\mathrm{km}$ below it s summit (Oakley et al., 2007, 2008). Like the many other serpentinit e mud volcanoes that populate the southern half of the Marian a forearc, Yinazao Seamount is situated along a zone of weakness i n the overriding plate’s lithosphere. The fault trend that controlled th e growth of the edifice has a northeast–southwest trend and intersects a northwest–southeast trend immediately south.  

A primary feature of the summit of Yinazao Seamount is a faul t scarp with a maximum throw of about $80\,\mathrm{m}$ that is colinear with th e northeast–southwest fault trend. The eastern half of the summit i s shallower, and the overall morphology of the summit suggests  a right-lateral motion on a fault with dip-slip to the northwest. Th e offset on the fault is apparently a combination of footwall uplif t (eastern block) and downdrop of the hanging wall to the northwes t (western block). This deformation may have directed the egress o f rising fluids to the southwest edge of the summit area where  a spring was located. Systematic variation in interstitial water composition from serpentinite mud piston cores collected from the research vessel (R/V) Thomas G. Thompson in 2003 confirmed th e presence of fluid discharge at a rate of up to ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{cm/y}$ (Hulme et al., 2010). Discharge at rates of meters per year was identified fro m push cores collected in 2003 by the remotely operated vehicl e (ROV) Jason II within a $50\,\mathrm{m}$ range of the piston core with the greatest fluid upwelling rate.

Coring on the flank of Yinazao Seamount, as on those of th e other two target mud volcanoes, was designed to recover some o f the oldest serpentinite mudflow materials. We anticipated recovering matrix muds and rock clasts that would provide information regarding the lithology of these early erupted materials. Serpentinize d peridotite clasts and other lithologies might reveal different decollement pressure, temperature, and compositional conditions fro m those that would be expected in the earlier stages of the forearc evolution. It was also expected that interstitial waters would have interacted with seawater after lengthy exposure at the base of th e seamount. Such interactions may affect microbial communitie s present in the subseafloor environment. Each of the five flank site s on these three seamounts is located on a multichannel seismi c (MCS) line (Oakley, et al., 2007; Oakley, 2008) that intersected either a region of the flank that was undisturbed by mass-wasting o r that crossed the distal edge of a mudflow of particular interest.  

Fantangisña Seamount (informally known as Celestial Seamount) is located about $62\;\mathrm{km}$ from the trench (Figure F1). Base d on MCS data, it lies about $14\,\mathrm{km}$ above the subducting Pacific plat e (Table T1). This seamount lies on the northern edge of a prominen t uplifted forearc block that trends northwest and is intersection by  a northeast-trending lineament. The main feature of the summit is  a slump on the northern flank. Several stages of slumps exist, base d on nested headwalls with sharply defined features at 2000 and 184 0 m water depth, for example.  

No active seeps or chimneys were observed during the one RO V Jason $I I$ dive (J2-038) on Fantangisña Seamount in 2003. This div e started within the summit depression at the headwall of a low-relie f $2000\ \mathrm{m}$ slump scar and traversed up the southeastern slope to th e summit rim. The only indication of active serpentinite mud volcanism is based on one piston core from the center of the summit depression. This core recovered $40\ \mathrm{{cm}}$ of serpentinite material; however, at the base of the core, concentrations of $\mathrm{Mg}$ and alkalinit y (49.6 and $0.89\,\mathrm{\mmol/kg}_{\mathrm{}}$ , respectively) in interstitial waters wer e lower than bottom seawater values (53 and $2.4\mathrm{\mmol/kg},$ , respectively). These data indicate a deep-sourced input close to the seafloor, consistent with slow, centimeters per year or less discharge o f interstitial waters.  

Asùt Tesoru Seamount (informally called Big Blue Seamount) i s a serpentinite mud volcano that lies about $72\;\mathrm{km}$ from the trenc h axis with the subducting slab approximately $18~\mathrm{km}$ below its summit (Oakley et al., 2007, 2008) (Figure F1; Table T1). Asùt Tesor u Seamount is the farthest from the trench of the three seamount s targeted for coring. It is also the largest one on the Mariana forearc, with a diameter of ${\sim}50~\mathrm{km}$ and over $2~\mathrm{km}$ high. The major faul t trend that controlled the growth of the edifice has a north-northeas t trend and is crosscut by a fault trending north-northwest. Asùt Tesoru Seamount may have been active since the Eocene, based o n analysis of two serpentine-bearing $\mathrm{\sim}50\%$ serpentine) sediment intervals immediately above Eocene basement recovered during Dee p Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 60 at Site 459 (Despraires, 1982).  

The summit region of Asùt Tesoru Seamount has a prominen t mound at the intersection of the two fault trends. The summi t mound is roughly circular and about $3\;\mathrm{km}$ in diameter and $200\ \mathrm{m}$ high. At its apex, it has three smaller circular mounds. One is centered at the middle of the ${\sim}1.5\,\mathrm{km}$ plateau on top of the mound an d is about $350~\mathrm{m}$ in diameter and $40\;\mathrm{{m}}$ high. The two other mound s are about $200\,\textrm{m}$ in diameter and $^{20\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ high. The two smalle r mounds lie side by side west of the larger mound and are both overlapped by it. An ROV transect of the larger mound was conducte d in 2003 with the Jason $I I$ (J2-034 and J2-036) from west to east. Th e highest rate of fluid discharge occurred in the middle of the surveyed mound on the summit of the seamount.  

South Chamorro Seamount is located about $78~\mathrm{km}$ from th e trench, with the subducting slab approximately $18~\mathrm{km}$ below it s summit; it was drilled during ODP Leg 195 (Figure F1; Table T1). This seamount is primarily composed of unconsolidated flows o f serpentinite mud with clasts consisting dominantly of serpentinize d peridotite but also includes greenschist and blueschist rock fragments from the subducted Pacific plate (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002). The summit shows active fluid seepage of slab-derived fluid s with megafaunal assemblages that include mussels, gastropods, worm tubes, and galatheid crabs (Fryer and Mottl, 1997). Subsurface microbes include archaea (Mottl et al., 2003; Curtis et al., 2013 ) and Bacteria (Takai et al., 2005). Even with evidence for fluid flo w from a deep source (Hulme et al., 2010), temperatures measured i n the uppermost $1\,\mathrm{m}$ at Site 1200 are between $2^{\circ}$ and $3^{\circ}C$ , which is jus t above the bottom water temperature of $1.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

During Leg 195, a borehole observatory (CORK) was deployed. This original-style CORK included a $202.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ long casing with  a screened section from about 148.8 to 202.3 meters below seafloo r (mbsf). This screened section provides a conduit for formation fluids at depth to exchange with fluids within the borehole. When th e borehole is open at the seafloor, fluids naturally discharge (Wheat e t al., 2008). However, the lack of latches to maintain formation pressure and the small diameter imposed by the original-style COR K limit the usefulness of this installation. The plan for Expedition 36 6 was to remove the CORK body, leaving the hole open for a futur e ROV deployment of a CORK-Lite (Wheat et al., 2012).  

# Objectives  

The four primary scientific goals outlined in the Expedition 36 6 Scientific Prospectus were to assess (1) mass transport processes i n the Mariana forearc region, (2) spatial variability of slab-related fluids, (3) metamorphic and tectonic history and physical properties o f the subduction zone, and (4) biological activity associated wit h deep-derived subduction zone material. To meet or address thes e goals, the specific objectives were to gain better insight into mas s transport (fluids and solid materials) in the Mariana forearc regio n and its relationship to subduction zone tectonics and subseafloo r biological processes. The sites chosen for drilling on the three targe t serpentinite mud volcanoes span different distances (and depth t o slab) from the Mariana Trench. Results from Expedition 366 wil l therefore complement previous drilling completed during OD P Legs 125 and 195. In addition, the long-term goal of the expeditio n was to establish borehole observatory sites at the summits of th e three seamounts targeted for coring.  

To meet the specific objectives for coring during Expeditio n 366, the operational plan was to (1) intersect mudflows of variabl e composition that mantled the flank of each edifice and, at the tw o that were known to be active, recover conduit muds from areas nea r active springs; (2) potentially date discrete mudflows paleontologically, should there be sediment layers between them; (3) determin e variability in the composition of rock clasts in the mudflows; (4) investigate potential systematic variability in degree of serpentinization (possibly lower degrees at initiation of mud volcanism vi a conduit “throat clearing” or greater on the flanks where rock clast s may have reacted more fully with enclosing serpentinite muds an d fluids); (5) examine transport conditions of muds and interstitia l waters; (6) provide a measure for the scale of potential fluid discharge characteristics (e.g., diffuse versus channelized); (7) determine the composition of fluid from depth; and (8) collect sample s for the study of microbial/viral community interactions at dept h and if possible near the underlying forearc sediment surface under  a range of conditions.  

The primary objective for establishing borehole observatorie s was to deploy three screened and cased boreholes that bisect hydrologic zones (aquifers), one at each of the three summit sites o n Yinazao, Fantangisña, and Asùt Tesoro Seamounts. These boreholes, each sealed with cement at their base, would then serve as th e foundation for a return mission with an ROV to emplace CORKLites within the cased holes. CORK-Lites would enable downhol e monitoring, experimental capabilities, and collection of pristin e deep-source fluids within a gas-tight sampling system for dissolve d gas analyses. Given the original-style CORK at South Chamorr o Seamount, the objective was to remove the CORK body so the borehole could be used for a range of experiment types and instrumen t sizes.  

# Coring results  

Three serpentinite mud volcanoes were cored during Expedition 366 (Yinazao, Fantangisña, and Asùt Tesoro Seamounts). Cored materials were recovered from each of the summit and flan k sites using a variety of coring technologies designed for maximu m recovery, penetrating hard materials, or achieving a desired dept h (Table T2). Thus, combined with data from Legs 125 and 195, th e new data from Expedition 366 provide a continuum from relativel y cool $(\sim\!80^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and shallow $\langle{\sim}13\ \mathrm{km}\rangle$ conditions at depth within th e subduction channel closer to the trench to hot $(\mathrm{\sim}350^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and dee p $\left({\sim}19\,\mathrm{km}\right)$ conditions further from the trench. It is important to not e that the depths to the slab given in Table T1 for Yinazao, Fantangisña, and Asùt Tesoro Seamounts are based on estimates fro m at least two MCS profiles across these edifices (Oakley et al., 2007, 2008; Oakley, 2008). However, for Conical and South Chamorr o Seamounts there are no MCS data. As a consequence, a depth t o slab estimate was determined for these edifices based on a numbe r of assumptions. The estimate assumes (1) that the subducting Pacific plate is a smooth surface (i.e., has carried no subducted seamounts down, although the drilling results show it has), (2) that th e trench itself is unperturbed by interaction with subducting seamounts and thus subtends a smooth curve that is an average of th e thalweg position (Hulme et al., 2010) (bathymetry maps; e.g., Figur e F1) (however, there are significant perturbations associated wit h impact from Pacific seamounts entering the trench), (3) that th e plate subducts along the shortest perpendicular to a tangent of tha t average curve and that the distance of the seamount summit fro m the trench can be determined by measuring along that perpendicular, (4) that the angle of convergence between the Pacific plate an d the trench lies along that perpendicular (though it does not), an d (5) that paragenesis models using equilibrium assemblages of metamorphic minerals in subduction-channel-derived rocks recovere d from coring and drilling on these two edifices do not fit a graphi c model for depth to slab beneath the seamounts. The paragenesi s models are described fully in Maekawa et al. (1993), Fryer et al. (2006), and Gharib (2006). Therefore, we used the depths of th e three seamounts cored during this expedition, as estimated by MC S data, to fit a line defining a depth versus distance from the curv e representing an average of the trench position and extrapolated tha t line to the distances of the summits of Conical and South Chamorr o Seamounts as measured along the perpendicular to the tangent o f the average trench-curve to establish an estimate for the depths t o slab beneath those seamounts. Therefore, we caution the reader t o bear in mind that depths to slab beneath the seamounts drille d during Legs 125 and 195 are certainly deeper than those drille d during Expedition 366 but may be subject to errors on the order o f perhaps a few kilometers.

Materials recovered during drilling operations were analyze d using standard techniques commonly utilized during IODP expeditions. We present a summary of these data types and an initial interpretation  organized  by  shipboard  laboratory,  providing  a n integrated model of subsurface processes based on data from eac h of the three cored sites. Each laboratory began the process of comparing and contrasting results from summit sites, which represen t the most pristine materials in terms of transport from depth, an d flank sites, where eruptive materials overlie previous deposits an d have undergone alteration reactions made possible through diffusive exchange with overlying oxic bottom seawater. Ultimately, results from the various laboratories will be integrated to provid e greater constraints for evaluating mass transport, temporal variability, metamorphic and tectonic history, and microbial mechanism s and activity.  

# Lithostratigraphy, petrology, and structure  

Material recovered during Expedition 366 consists primarily o f serpentinite mud (Zone 1 in Figure F2) containing lithic clasts derived from the underlying forearc crust (Zone 2 in Figure F2) an d mantle and the subducting Pacific plate. A thin cover of pelagic sediment was found at many sites, whereas pelagic sediments and volcanic ash deposits were cored underlying serpentinite mudflows o n the distal flanks of one of the three cored seamounts (Zone 3 in Figure F2). The conceptual model for serpentinite mud volcanism processes within forearc/subduction complex is best described with  a cross-section perpendicular to the trench (depicted schematicall y in Figure F2). Here, we describe in more detail the results from eac h site cored during Expedition 366.  

The bulk of the material recovered in the cores is serpentinit e mudflow matrix (Zone 1 in Figure F2). The matrix ranges from pal e green to dark blue-gray, except in the upper few meters of material recovered on the flanks of the seamount, where the serpentinite i s typically oxidized to a yellow-orange color. The serpentinite mu d consists largely of clay- to silt-sized serpentine grains plus accessor y phases such as Fe oxide (magnetite and/or hematite), brucite, spinel, calcite, hydrogarnet, talc, tremolite, and chlorite. Secondary alteration minerals include sjogrenite group minerals, clays, aragonite, and gypsum. Authigenic aragonite, as single acicular needles or radiating clusters of acicular crystals, is common in the upper fe w tens of meters. Some serpentinite mud horizons appear to be reworked; these horizons may contain pelagic nannofossils, volcani c ash, and mineral fragments (e.g., clinopyroxene). Clast content s vary from ${<}1\,\mathrm{vol}\%$ to more than $35\,\mathrm{vol\%}$ lithic clasts, with a mode o f around $5\,\mathrm{vol\%}$ lithic clasts.  

Ultramafic clasts are the dominant clast type (Zone 4) and ar e mainly serpentinized harzburgite $(<<\!5\%$ clinopyroxene) with les s common dunite and pyroxenite. The range in degree of serpentinization is broad, $30\%{-}100\%$ of the original material. Serpentinizatio n is commonly pseudomorphic, and primary modes are inferred i n most of the peridotites because the grain sizes for pyroxene (bastite ) and spinel are largely unaffected. Primary textures were identified i n most samples based on relict mineral phases or pyroxene-spinel relations. All dunites and most harzburgites (from Sites U1491, U1493–U1495, and U1497) are inferred to be porphyroclastic o r coarse tabular primary textures with elongate, deformed olivine an d enstatite, smaller strain-free neoblasts of olivine, as well as holl y leaf–shaped interstitial spinel (e.g., Mercier and Nicolas, 1975; Lenoir et al., 2000). Olivine in some dunite samples occurs as scattere d fragments with the same optical orientation that together for m

much larger (up to $1\;\mathrm{mm}$ ) deformed primary grains. These texture s imply that serpentinite materials have undergone solid-state deformation in the lithosphere at relatively low temperatures.  

By contrast, harzburgites from Sites U1492 and U1498 are characterized by protogranular textures, with vermicular spinel-pyroxene clusters inferred to represent decompression breakdown o f garnet (Smith, 1977; Bhanot et al., 2016). The protogranular textures are overprinted by a subsequent texture formed in response t o diffuse porous flow and reactive melt transport. Orthopyroxene ha s ragged lobate margins with sharp cusps that point into olivine grai n boundaries (or former grain boundaries); some olivine grains hav e flat facets against orthopyroxene, signifying crystal growth faces i n the presence of melt; and olivine also occurs as euhedral to anhedra l inclusions within larger orthopyroxene grains. Resorbed orthopyroxene sometimes has an oikocrystic appearance, with scattere d fragments with the same optical orientation. Textures resembl e postcumulus textures in cumulate rocks. These textures are inferre d to be melt infiltration textures formed by reactive diffuse porou s flow of a low-silica melt. This melt is undersaturated in orthopyroxene, which melted incongruently to form a silica-rich melt an d new olivine. Because the delicate apices of interstitial pyroxen e

would likely be destroyed by solid-state flow in the lithosphere, w e propose that this texture formed in the asthenosphere during mel t production in response to subduction initiation.  

No systematic changes of the serpentine textures were observe d between the different sites (Zones 1–4 in Figures F2, F3). Serpentinized ultramafic rocks display mainly pseudomorphic mes h and bastite textures that replaced olivine and orthopyroxene, respectively. Such textures are likely composed of lizardite and chrysotile, but this assumption needs to be verified with postexpeditio n analyses. The mesh displays a pronounced blue color at Yinazao an d Fantangisña Seamounts. Such coloration could be attributed to serpentine composition. Rare interpenetrating textures, which coul d correspond to the high pressure and temperature serpentine variet y (antigorite), were mainly observed at Fantangisña and Asùt Tesor u Seamounts. Serpentinized ultramafic clasts are commonly crosscu t by massive to fibrous veins of serpentine (chrysotile), crystallizin g into isolated networks of fractures, some of which are conjugate an d some of which display crack-seal-like textures within the vein center. Although the cored serpentinite mud volcanoes are located a t different distances from the Mariana Trench, the absence of a clea r variation of serpentine textures in the ultramafic clasts suggests tha t the  serpentinization  process  occurs  continuously  from  th e slab/mantle interface to the surface and that each mud volcano includes ultramafic clasts that were serpentinized at a range of depth s (temperature and pressure). Late stages of serpentinite alteratio n were observed within each mud volcano, mainly corresponding t o breccia  consisting  of  fragments  of  serpentine  minerals,  serpentinites, and clay minerals cemented by carbonate. The fragmentation obliterated previous serpentinite and mantle textures.  

Crustal rocks derived from the underlying forearc crust and th e subducting Pacific plate (Zones 3 and 6, respectively) were observe d at several sites, but they form a major fraction of the recovere d clasts at three sites: U1496 (Asùt Tesoru summit), U1497 (Fantangisña summit), and U1498 (Fantangisña flank). Low-grade metamorphosed sedimentary rocks and basalts were recovered from th e summit site of Asùt Tesoru Seamount (Site U1496). The sedimentary clasts are fossiliferous cherty limestones. Some mafic volcani c clasts are dolerites and augite-phyric vitrophyres, and some contai n pink titanaugite.  

Volcanic clasts from Fantangisña Seamount include forearc basalts (Zone 3), boninite and volcanic glass (possibly boninitic), an d greenstones and subgreenschist (prehnite-pumpellyite facies) metavolcanics (Zone 6). Metasediments from Sites U1497 and U1498 ar e characterized by recrystallization of calcareous and siliceous microfossils (Zone 5). The degree of recrystallization indicates low-grad e metamorphic conditions. Metasedimentary and volcanic rocks ar e brecciated to varying degrees. Clasts from ultracataclastic shea r zones with rounded clasts suggest deformation mechanisms alon g the plate boundary. Deformed sediment and volcanic rock clasts a t these sites and at Site U1496 are consistent with a significant fraction of the material entrained by the Fantangisña and Asùt Tesor u Seamounts having been derived from the subducting Pacific plat e (Zones 5 and 6), whereas clasts of boninite and volcanic glass wer e more likely from the oceanic crust of the Philippine Sea plate (Zon e 3).  

The seamounts overlie pelagic sediment rich in volcanic ash, which was sampled at Site U1498. This material is composed of volcanic ash, calcareous nannofossils (discoasters and coccoliths), foraminifers,  radiolarians,  and  sponge  spicules  (Zone  2).  Th e underlying volcanic ash establishes a maximum age for mud volcano activity or flank gravity sliding (Oakley et al., 2007). A simila r pelagic sediment was recovered in the first cores from most flan k sites; thus, paleontological analysis will help constrain the date o f the most recent activity at each site.  

# Site U1491  

Site U1491 is located on the flank of Yinazao Seamount near th e base of a slight bathymetric valley. Mixed pelagic muds containing  a variety of clastic materials were typically found at the tops of Hole s U1491A (1.3 mbsf), U1491B (19.4 mbsf), and U1491C (34.2 mbsf ) (Table T2). Beneath these pelagic sediments in Holes U1491B an d U1491C, we recovered sequences of normally graded carbonatedominated breccia–conglomerate that are likely the result of comminution and drilling disturbance (via heave from the drill string ) and serpentinite muds containing clasts of serpentinized ultramafi c and occasionally carbonate (fossiliferous reef limestone). The nature of the lithologic units recovered in Holes U1491A–U1491C i s consistent with the interpretation that these units represent serpentinite mudflows, the deepest of which tapped a source of carbonate clasts and serpentinized ultramafic rocks that are likely fa r less matrix supported than observed previously. The source of th e carbonate materials is possibly an underlying subducted Cretaceou s seamount.  

# Site U1492  

Site U1492 is located on the summit of Yinazao Seamount alon g the extension of an inferred normal fault. Holes U1492A, U1492B, U1492C, and U1492D were drilled to 38.3, 51.4, 139.1, and 228. 8 mbsf, respectively; no materials were recovered from Hole U1492 D (Table T2). Recovered materials from Holes U1492A and U1492 C consist of an uppermost unit of blue-gray to light brown (oxidized ) serpentinite pebbly mud with lithic clasts, Hole U1492B has a thi n $_{<0.4\mathrm{~m~}}$ thick) upper unit of pelagic sediment overlying a lower uni t of blue-gray serpentinite pebbly mud. The mudflow matrix contain s $5\%{-}10\%$ lithic clasts of serpentinized ultramafic rock. The occurrence of pelagic mud in Hole U1492B at the summit rim of Yinaza o Seamount is consistent with the observed sequence of predominantly serpentinite muds containing heavily serpentinized ultramafic clasts capped by a veneer of more oxidized, seawater-altere d serpentinite muds and a spotty, thin pelagic sediment cover. Hol e U1492C has an intermediate unit of green serpentinite mud. Ultramafic clasts in the lowermost portions of the boreholes display th e most extreme degrees of serpentinization, with continuous transition toward plastically deforming components. Conversely, ultramafic clasts in the brown to light green uppermost intervals retai n their hardness and frequently exhibit milder degrees of alteration.  

# Sites U1493, U1494, and U1495  

Sites U1493, U1494, and U1495 were drilled on a line fro m south to north on the south flank of Asùt Tesoru Seamount (Tabl e T2). The deepest site (U1493; 3359 meters below sea level [mbsl]) i s the closest to the distal southern edge of the edifice. Hole U1493 A was drilled to 0.1 mbsf, and Hole U1493B was drilled to $32.6\ \mathrm{mbsf}.$ Site U1494, with only one hole (39 mbsf) at $2200\ \mathrm{mbsl}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , is close t o the midflank of the edifice, and Site U1495, at $1400\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ , is locate d just south of the summit mound.  

Serpentinite muds are covered by brownish pelagic mud at Site s U1493 and U1495 that contains volcanic ash, foraminifers, nannofossils, and minor diatoms and radiolarians. The thickness of th e pelagic muds varies between sites, with approximately $80~\mathrm{{cm}}$ i n Hole U1493B, $_{0\;\mathrm{{cm}}}$ in Hole U1494A (likely lost during mudline attempts), $25~\mathrm{cm}$ in Hole U1495A, and $40\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ in Hole U1495B. Hol e U1494A recovered an interval of mass flow between 6.9 and 8.7 8 mbsf that contains reworked serpentinite mud, volcanic ash, an d brown muddy to silty fine sand with foraminifers that are assume d to derive from upslope sedimentary deposits. Holes U1495A (10. 7 mbsf) and U1495B $.10.8\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ exposed a sequence of sandy sil t with foraminifers and aragonite crystals overlying oxidized brownish and greenish gray serpentinite pebbly mud. The brownish gra y serpentinite pebbly mud contains authigenic aragonite crystals an d lithic clasts. The greenish gray serpentinite pebbly mud contain s lithic clasts and occasional layers of matrix-supported breccia–conglomerate.  

The three sites share a generally common stratigraphy that differs in detail with location. Uppermost recoveries consist of layer s of either reddish oxidized sediments or mixed blue-gray and orang e (oxidized) serpentinite pebbly mud. The pelagic sediments includ e microfossils and volcanic ash. The thickness of pelagic sediment s generally decreases upslope. Beneath the most oxidized layer of serpentinite mud, mudflows tend to grade from pale green to dark blu e with depth although they are intercalated with lighter green serpentinite muds in some depth intervals.  

Small clasts of mafic igneous rocks were enclosed in the mudflows. They include metabasalts displaying green (chlorite and possibly epidote) and pale red (carbonate) layers. The compositions o f the mafic rock clasts indicate that they are part of the subducte d oceanic crust from the Pacific plate, altered by low-grade metamorphism and seafloor hydration processes.  

# Site U1496  

Material from the summit of Asùt Tesoru Seamount (Hole s U1496A [44.8 mbsf] and U1496B [36 mbsf]; Hole U1496C had n o recovery) is characterized by a dominance of pale green serpentinit e mud with a low proportion of lithic clasts compared with the seamount’s flanks and other sites (Table T2). The pale green serpentinite mud is typically soupy or very soft due to high ga s contents and often continued to out-gas days later. Dark blue serpentinite mud is uncommon, but when present it is characterize d by higher clast counts. These characteristics are consistent with a n active summit site that is currently producing high-pH water an d abiotic hydrogen and methane.  

Although less common than at other sites, hard rock clasts derived from the seamount summit mound provide important insights into the plumbing system of the mud volcano. Most commo n are ultramafic clasts, typically highly serpentinized harzburgite s with less common dunite and orthopyroxenite. These material s likely derive from the underlying forearc mantle lithosphere.  

We also recovered clasts of mafic metavolcanic and sedimentar y rock. Sedimentary clasts include a fossiliferous, cherty limeston e that may be pre-Eocene in age. Mafic metavolcanic clasts includ e dolerites with pink titanaugite and augite-phyric vitrophyres. Th e presence of titanaugite in these rocks indicate that their protolith s were alkali basalts. They are interpreted to be recycled materia l from subducted seamounts of the Pacific plate.  

# Site U1497  

Four holes were drilled at Site U1497 on the summit of Fantangisña Seamount (Holes U1497A [34.2 mbsf] and U1497B [23. 8 mbsf]; no recovery from Holes U1497C and U1497D) (Table T2). The occurrence of deformed sediments and volcanic rocks at thi s site suggests that a significant fraction of the material entrained b y this mud volcano is derived from the subducting Pacific plate. I n particular, titanaugite-bearing volcanic rocks imply mildly alkalin e volcanic series in an ocean island seamount. In addition, the deformed sediments appeared to contain microfossils, such as radiolarians, that are representative of older (Mesozoic?) sediment fro m the Pacific plate. The presence of ultracataclasite, which requires severe brittle deformation, is unlikely to have occurred in sediment s that were lying on top of the upper plate. Deformation of the Pacifi c plate as it bends on approach to the Mariana Trench and move s within the subduction channel could easily entail sufficient strain t o produce these textures.  

Mantle-derived harzburgites from Site U1497 are fully serpentinized but retain evidence of primary textures. They are characterized by pseudomorphs of orthopyroxene porphyroclasts tha t are highly elongated (in one case $4\ \mathrm{mm}\times0.4\ \mathrm{mm})$ ), with kink fold s and undulatory extinction. Spinel occurs in association with pyroxene and with subhedral to holly leaf shapes, $1{-}2~\mathrm{mm}$ in size. We interpret  these  observations  to  indicate  altered  porphyroclasti c textures, consistent with deformation at relatively low temperature s and moderate to high rates of strain. The (meta-) sediments ar e characterized by recrystallization of calcareous and siliceous microfossils. The degree of recrystallization indicates low-grade metamorphic conditions. Both the metasedimentary and metavolcani c rocks are brecciated to varying degrees. Brecciation resulted in th e development of fine-grained cataclasite to ultracataclasite domains. The very fine grained sediments (shales and sandstones) were partl y transformed into ultracataclastic shear zones with rounded clasts. The very small grain size $\left(<2\,\upmu\mathrm{m}\right)$ within these shear zones indicate s that the general deformation mechanism was ductile flow. Shea r might have been localized along these shear zones. In general, brecciation (fracture) implies cataclastic deformation mechanisms (fracture and friction) at low-grade, moderate to high strain rates.  

# Site U1498  

Site U1498 is located on the flank of Fantangisña Seamount . Hole U1498A (181.6 mbsf) is on the extreme southwestern flank, very close to the distal edge of the edifice and immediately downslope from a distinct break in slope of the lower flank (at 3507. 5 mbsl) (Table T2). Hole U1498B (260 mbsf; $3296.0\;\mathrm{mbsl})$ is ${\sim}700\mathrm{~m~}$ upslope northeast of Hole U1498A. Lithologies recovered at Sit e U1498A, with increasing depth in hole, include yellowish oxidize d pelagic muds with pelagic microfossils; intercalated blue, green, an d yellow-orange serpentinite mudflow matrix silts and sands; partiall y serpentinized ultramafic rocks (harzburgite and dunite); mafi c metavolcanic rocks and boninites; and, at the bottom of the hole, nannofossil- and volcanic ash-rich sedimentary rocks (siltstone s and fine sandstones). In addition, Hole U1498B returned a large $^{\cdot\sim2}$ m) compound clast of ultramafic rock, mafic metavolcanic rock, metalimestone,  and  metachert,  likely  originally  within  a  serpentinite mud matrix, which was not recovered because the use o f rotary coring likely washed out any existing matrix. All but th e ultramafic rock is suspected to be part of a Cretaceous seamount.  

The recovered clasts from Hole U1498B provide a particularl y illuminating sequence of materials that deserves more detailed description. With increasing depth, the recovery includes (1) partiall y altered (to clay) serpentinized ultramafic rock clasts (stones an d boulders),  (2)  serpentinite  pebbly  mud  with  pebbles  of  serpentinized ultramafics, (3) boulders of serpentinized ultramafic s with numerous fractures filled with chrysotile, and (4) boulders o f metabasite and cherty limestone and clasts of boninite and volcani c glass. These clasts and boulders were likely embedded within serpentinite pebbly mud (observed adhering to some of them), muc h of which was probably washed out during rotary coring. The mudflow matrix is well preserved in Sections 366-U1498B-7R-1 throug h 21R-1, $0{-}30\;\mathrm{cm}$ , with intermittent boulders, although it does sho w drilling disturbance (flow-in). The most surprising recovery occur s in Core 21R. In Section 21R-1, $116\,\mathrm{cm}$ , there is a preserved and presumed inverted primary contact between a boulder of metabasit e $\!\!\langle35\!-\!116\;\mathrm{cm}_{\!}$ ; interpreted to be “igneous basement”) and a boulder o f cherty limestone $_{\left.116-132\right.\mathrm{cm}}$ and continuing into Section 22R-1,  

$0{-}81\,\mathrm{cm}$ ; interpreted to be “sedimentary cover,” i.e., originally overlying the metabasite). The deformed cherty limestone appears t o contain microfossils such as radiolarians that are common in olde r sediments from the Pacific plate. The texture and mineralogica l composition of the metabasite (greenstone with chlorite and amphibole) and cherty limestone indicate low- to possibly mediumgrade metamorphic overprint of these lithologies. These two boulders are clearly distinct from the volcanic rocks (boninites an d forearc basalts) of the overriding Mariana forearc crust. The metabasite and limestones are consistent with a lower plate origin, an d their paragenesis and position within the serpentinite mudflow matrix material suggests a dynamic overturning during exhumation. Furthermore, preserved cataclastic faults and extensional structure s within these boulders (high-angle normal faults and extensiona l veins) may be related to (1) shearing within the subduction channe l and bending of the lower plate during subduction, (2) accretion an d vertical tectonism of intact seamount/guyot masses into the forear c region, or (3) faulting during the early stages of exhumation. Th e presence of ultracataclasite in the cherty limestone boulder require s severe brittle deformation that would not likely occur in sedimen t from the overriding forearc crust. At the base of Section 22R-CC, $81{-}93~\mathrm{cm}$ , is a serpentinite mudflow matrix that continues to Section 23R-1, $12~\mathrm{cm}$ . A boulder of greenstone with numerous fractures infilled with white secondary precipitate was observed i n Section 23R-1, $12{-}81~\mathrm{cm}$ . At Section 24R-1, $9~\mathrm{{cm}}$ , we recovered  a contact between serpentinite mud matrix containing serpentinize d ultramafic rock and dark-gray, pelagic, vitric silt and volcanic as h that contains microfossils. We thus achieved our goal of penetratin g into the sediment that predates serpentinite flows at this site. Beginning at Section 27R-1, $13~\mathrm{cm}$ , we recovered intercalated pelagic, light tan to medium brown layers of pelagic, silty clay and volcani c ash that persisted to the end of the hole.  

# Sediment and rock chemistry  

A selection of representative serpentinite mudflow matrix, various igneous and sedimentary rocks, serpentinite mud, and sediments recovered during Expedition 366 were analyzed with the ne w portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (pXRF). On the basis o f these and visual results, a subset of materials was powdered for  a suite of ship- and shore-based analyses (Table T3). In addition,  a thin section was located next to each of the powered rock samples. At sea, powered samples were analyzed using standard inductivel y coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) techniques to measure concentrations of $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3},$ CaO, $\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}},$ MgO, MnO, $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O},$ , ${\mathrm{SiO}}_{2}$ , $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ , Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Sc, V, and $Z\mathbf{r}$ and the pXR F was used to determine concentrations of $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3},\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3},\mathrm{CaO},\mathrm{Cr},\mathrm{Cu}$ , $\mathrm{MgO},$ , Mn, Ni, Cr, Zn, $\mathrm{{SiO}_{2},}$ and $\scriptstyle\mathrm{Sr}$ (Table T4).  

Recovered serpentinites are largely uniform in composition, with serpentinized ultramafic rocks and serpentinite muds spanning a limited range in $S i O_{2}$ , MgO, and $\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}}$ compositions (Figur e F4). No significant site-to-site or seamount-to-seamount variabilit y was evident in these major elements or in the variations in $\mathrm{{Al}}_{2}\mathrm{{O}}_{3},$ which range from 0.1 to $1.7\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ with a mean value of ${\approx}0.6\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Table T3). This range is similar to the ranges reported by Savov et al. (2005a, 2005b, 2007) for serpentinized ultramafic clasts from Conical Seamount and for mudflow matrix and clasts from Sout h Chamorro Seamount.  

Fluid-immobile minor and trace elements Ni, Cr, Zn, V, and S c show no clear distinctions from site to site or seamount to seamount in the serpentinized ultramafic rocks (Figure F5). V, Sc, Mn, and $Z\mathfrak{n}$ show regular patterns of variation; these elements appea r not to be redistributed by fluid-rock exchanges associated with serpentinization. $\mathrm{TiO_{2}}$ variations in serpentinites differ from those o f the other immobile elements in that there may be site-related variability, with higher values evident for Site U1496 samples. However, Ti concentrations are close to the limits of detection using the shipboard ICP-AES, with only a fraction of our samples yielding detectable readings. It is equally possible that this small number of highe r values were analytical artifacts.  

Major and trace elements that are sensitive to redistribution b y fluid-rock exchange processes with ultramafic rocks show mor e variable patterns (Table T3). CaO concentrations show considerable variability, ranging from $_{<0.01}$ to $>\!10\,\mathrm{\wt\%}$ across a limite d range in $\mathrm{MgO}$ values (Figure F6). A few samples analyzed from all three seamounts include rocks with both $\mathrm{CaO}\ge10~\mathrm{wt\%}$ and hig h $\mathrm{MgO}_{\mathrm{{}}}$ , suggestive of ultramafic cumulate bulk compositions fo r some of the serpentinized ultramafic rocks. A plot of $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ versu s $\mathrm{MgO}$ (Figure F6) shows an evident distinction between the serpentinized ultramafic clasts, which have $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ values of ${<}0.4\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ and the serpentinite muds, which range as high as $2.0\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ \mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}.$ Seamount-to-seamount variations are evident; serpentinite mud s from the Asùt Tesoru summit site (U1496) have higher $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ concentrations than those from the summits of Yinazao Seamount (Sit e U1492) or Fantangisña Seamount (Site U1497). Interstitial waters a t the Asùt Tesoru summit extend to markedly higher abundances o f Na than do those from the summits of Fantangisña or Yinazao Seamounts. Thus, the high $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ in Asùt Tesoru muds may reflec t equilibration with these Na-enriched interstitial waters.  

Sr concentrations in serpentinites are highly variable, rangin g from ${<}5$ to ${>}6000\,\mathrm{\,ppm}$ (Table T4). As with $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{:}$ , the serpentinize d ultramafic clasts are lower in Sr abundance $({\le}100~\mathrm{ppm})$ , relative t o the serpentinite muds $100{-}6000+$ ppm; mean $\approx600\:\mathrm{ppm}]$ ). In addition, there are clear seamount-to-seamount differences in the serpentinite composition of the muds, likely related to equilibriu m with their associated interstitial waters. Yinazao Seamount mud s (Site U1492; interstitial waters $>700\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$ ) are markedly higher in S r than those from Asùt Tesoru Seamount (Site U1496; interstitial waters $\leq10~\upmu\mathrm{M})$ . The highest $\operatorname{Sr}$ and $\mathrm{Ca}$ in serpentinite mud sample s were found in near-surface cores and relate to the presence of authigenic aragonite and/or gypsum.  

A small number of metamorphosed mafic volcanic and crusta l rocks  (sedimentary  breccias,  metamorphosed  basalts,  an d boninites) were recovered, primarily from the summits of Asùt Tesoru Seamount (Site U1496) and Fantangisña Seamount (Site s U1497 and U1498) (Tables T3, T4). The metabasalts show elevate d concentrations of $\mathrm{{iO}_{2}\,(1.6\%{-3.3\%})}$ and $\mathrm{K_{2}O}$ $(2.7\%{-}6.7\%)$ and rang e from 16 to $18.6\,\mathrm{\,\,wt\%}$ in $\mathrm{{Al}_{2}\mathrm{{O}_{3}}}$ , with highly variable $\mathrm{MgO}$ $(2.5\%-$ $11.3\%)$ and $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ $(0.8\%{-3.5\%})$ (Figure F7). Analyzed metabasit e samples have Ni concentrations of ${\sim}55\,\mathrm{ppm}$ , high $\mathrm{V}$ and Sc concentrations (up to 280 and $28\,\mathrm{ppm}$ , respectively) (Figure F5), Sr concentrations between 54 and $236\,\mathrm{ppm}$ (Figure F6), Ba concentrations u p to $88\,\mathrm{\ppm}_{:}$ , and $Z\mathbf{r}$ concentrations between $\mathord{\sim}240$ and 470 ppm. There is evidence for within-clast heterogeneity; samples from eac h of the two core sections characterized by mafic clasts (Sections 366-

Molar MgO vs. FeO diagram after Hanson and Langmuir (1978), showing Expedition 366 ultramafic clasts and mafic clasts. Most Expedition 366 clasts fall in the residual mantle field, whereas mafic clasts are consistent with lavas formed from basaltic melts via varying degrees of fractional crystallization. Green fields reflect range of value s from serpentinized ultramafic rocks collected on Conical and South Chamorro Seamounts and analyzed by Savov et al. (2007).

U1496B-8X-CC and 10F-2) show considerable variability in a number of immobile and mobile elements. Plotted on the Shervai s (1982) V-Ti tectonic provenance diagram, these rocks are similar t o those from the intraplate/alkali basalt field (Figure F5).  

The metamorphosed mafic rocks resemble a subset of (1) samples recovered from dredges along a wall of a forearc graben nort h of the sites drilled during Expedition 366 (Johnson and Fryer, 1990 ) and (2) trachybasalts recovered from the western Pacific immediately outboard of the Mariana Trench (http://www.iedadata.org) . These mafic rocks do not resemble the forearc tholeiite and boninite lavas that were known to comprise the volcanic crust of the oute r Mariana forearc (e.g., Reagan et al., 2010). Thus, the most likely origin for these rocks is the downgoing Pacific plate, where seamount s that expose alkalic lavas are currently subducting.  

# Interstitial water geochemistry  

Studies of interstitial water geochemistry from summit site s cored during Expedition 366 focused on collecting end-membe r compositional information, thus improving our overall understanding of the deep-sourced processes. In contrast, studies of interstitial waters from the flanks of the three cored seamounts focused on elucidating compositional changes of interstitial waters with time i n the context of water-rock reactions, diffusive exchange with seawater, microbial activity, and processes associated with pelagic sediments that underlie serpentinite mud volcanoes in the Marian a forearc.  

Analyses of dissolved gases $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ , $\mathrm{{CH}_{4},}$ and $\mathrm{C_{2}H_{6}}$ provide important insights into the physical and chemical conditions of the dee p source. High concentrations of dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ $\mathrm{{CH}_{4},}$ and ${\cal C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{6}$ wer e measured in samples from the summit of Asùt Tesoru Seamount, and comparatively low but significant levels were detected a t Yinazao Seamount summit and flank sites. Variability in gas compositions among the three seamounts indicate differences in serpentinization and fluid migration processes. Dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ (Figure F8A) show two groupings broadly consistent with thermodynamic estimates of serpentinization-driven $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ production (McCollom and Bach, 2009) and subsequent abiotic (Fischer-Tropsc h Type) ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ production.

Figure F5. Immobile trace element variations in serpentinite muds and clasts, Expedition 366. V vs. Ti/1000 discriminator diagram for mafic and ultramafi c samples (Shervais, 1982).  

Plots of methane versus ethane data from Asùt Tesoru, Conical, and South Chamorro Seamounts reveal linear trends (Figure F8B). Data from Asùt Tesoru Seamount are consistent with trends fro m South Chamorro and Conical Seamounts. These trends may reflec t different methane consumption rates and/or methane productio n rates of subseafloor microbial communities, likely associated wit h habitability, abundance, and function. Both trends converge at a potential end-member composition $\mathrm{(CH_{4}=60{-}100\;m M}$ , $\mathrm{C_{2}H_{6}}=600-$ $1000\,\upmu\mathrm{M},$ , and $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratio $=100{-}150)$ that may represent the hydrocarbon values predominantly produced by abiotic (Fisher-Tropsc h Type) synthesis processes at depth.  

The chemical composition of deep-sourced interstitial water s was assessed along the continuum from shallow to deep source an d from closest to farthest from the trench (Yinazao, Fantangisña, Asù t Tesoru, South Chamorro, and Conical Seamounts) (Table T1; Figure F9). Fluids from the summits of Yinazao and, to a lesser extent , Fantangisña Seamounts show elevated Ca and Sr and low to extremely low K, Na, Cl, $\mathrm{SO}_{4},$ B, and $\mathrm{Na}/\mathrm{Cl}$ concentrations relative t o bottom seawater. In contrast, fluids that upwelled at the summit o f Asùt Tesoru seamount are similar in composition to those fro m South Chamorro and Conical Seamounts, with extremely high p H values (up to 12.4), Ca and Sr depletions, and marked enrichment s in carbonate alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolve d

organic carbon (DOC), $\mathrm{NH}_{4},$ Na, K, $\mathrm{Na}/\mathrm{Cl}_{:}$ , and B. Na concentrations are higher at Asùt Tesoru than any of these five seamount s (Figure F9; see discussion below).  

We mapped changes in the chemical composition of interstitia l waters across the Mariana forearc in relation to subduction-relate d prograde diagenetic and metamorphic reactions that may trigge r fluid and elemental releases (Figures F10, F11). Processes that occurred early (shallow) within the subduction system (i.e., Yinaza o and Fantangisña Seamounts) were likely dominated by diagenesi s and opal dehydration, whereas later processes (deeper) (i.e., Asù t Tesoru Seamount) included decarbonation and clay mineral decomposition (Fryer, Pearce, Stokking, et al., 1990; Haggerty, 1991; Haggerty and Chaudhuri, 1992; Haggerty and Fisher, 1992; Mottl, 1992; Mottl and Alt, 1992; Fryer et al., 1999; Mottl et al., 2003, 2004; Hulme et al., 2010; Wheat et al., 2008, 2010). Higher DIC at greate r depths-to-slab is likely linked to carbonate decomposition withi n the slab. DIC reacting with $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ from serpentinization could produc e $\mathrm{{CH}_{4},}$ , light alkanes, or short-chained organic molecules (e.g., acetat e and formate). Ca and Sr were sequestered from the fluids by carbonate precipitation (the lack of calcite in core samples from Asù t Tesoru Seamount suggests this reaction occurred slightly closer t o the trench, which would exhaust Ca with continued $C O{_3}^{2-}$ production). Although Asùt Tesoru Seamount’s interstitial waters ar e broadly similar to those studied at South Chamorro and Conical Seamounts, they are nonetheless distinct, with much higher Na an d Cl concentrations and 3–4 times lower B contents. These differences likely reflect the lowest pressure-temperature (P-T) prograd e metamorphic mineralogical reactions, impacting slab sediment s and saponites that result in fluid release (Figure F11).

This slab signal is overprinted by low-temperature peridotiteseawater reactions and microbial interaction with fluids, particularly near the seafloor (Mottl et al., 2003; Takai et al., 2005; Curtis e t al., 2013) and on the flanks of the seamounts. Initial interstitial water results from five flank sites cored during Expedition 366 indicat e that the fluids are mixtures of slab-derived fluids that have undergone various degrees of alteration with serpentinite materials in th e mud flows and exchange with overlying seawater.

# Sample recovery  

Microbiology sampling during Expedition 366 focused on exploring the limits of microbial life and viral components in serpentinite  mudflow  habitats  across  multiple  depths  usin g cultivation-based and cultivation-independent molecular biologica l approaches and microscopy. Sampling efforts targeted both nearsurface and deeper whole-round cores, especially if there was evidence of a transition across gradients of microbiologically affectin g compounds and gases (e.g., hydrogen, methane, hydrogen sulfide, and sulfate). Two $20\,\mathrm{cm}$ long whole-round samples were collected a t each sampled depth for general microbial analyses (Table T5). Additional whole-round samples were collected for individual investigations. Samples were collected within the context of tracer studie s to assess potential contamination resulting from the drilling an d sample recovery processes.  

Microbiological samples will be analyzed on shore using an array of microbial community–level interrogation techniques. Samples were fixed for total cell counts to quantify microbial biomass. Other samples were maintained at $4^{\circ}C$ for multiple cultivation techniques (including fluorescence-activated cell sorter [FACS] highthroughput media screening and detection of adaptation to physica l parameters such as pressure tolerance). Other samples were flashfrozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for molecular analyses, including small-subuni t (SSU) ribosomal gene amplicon sequencing (to address communit y structure in greater detail), functional gene detection and quantification through real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactio n (qPCR), and single-cell genomics (to specifically address individua l cell contributions). In addition, metagenomics of the entire microbial community and metatranscriptomics of the most highly expressed genes will be used to establish metabolic potential an d deeper ecological and evolutionary relationships. Lastly, sample s were preserved for enumerating viral counts and assessing viral diversity.  

# Contamination testing  

Perfluoromethylcyclohexane (PMCH) was used at the first tw o sites (U1491 and U1492) and the last site (U1498), and perfluoromethyldecalin (PFMD) was used at the remaining sites (U1493– U1497). This split was partially due to tracer availability and partially to our ability to establish proper protocols for both perfluorocarbon tracers (PFTs). Data obtained from PMCH measurement s show relatively clean (uncontaminated) drilling by advanced pisto n corer (APC) and half-length APC (HLAPC) operations at Sit e U1492. This analysis, however, indicates disturbance in cores an d drill fluid intrusion at Site U1498, which was drilled using a rotar y core barrel (RCB) technique. Generally, drill fluid intrusion int o samples was higher at sites where drilling became difficult and required the use of either extended core barrel (XCB) or RCB drilling.  

Analysis of the PFMD data does not provide a distinct quantitative assessment of contamination, unlike the PMCH tracer. PFMD i s a relatively new method for contamination tracing, and the result s from this expedition strongly reinforce the need for further metho d development if it is to be used when coring sediment.  

# Shipboard DNA extraction and qPCR  

Shipboard DNA extraction from serpentinite mud samples wa s unsuccessful using a standard qPCR protocol (e.g., Lever et al., 2015). Additional analysis shows high adsorption of DNA to serpentinite minerals; thus, improvements in DNA extraction protocols in terms of adsorption prevention will be necessary for furthe r DNA extractions. Performing qPCRs on board the R/V JOIDES Resolution is feasible and can expand the range of available shipboar d analyses for future expeditions.  

# Physical properties  

Among the eight sites that were drilled during Expedition 366, the physical properties obtained at the two summit sites at Yinaza o and Asùt Tesoru Seamounts (Sites U1492 and U1496, respectively ) are distinct. Physical property values are usually associated wit h consolidation and compaction of sedimentary deposits (e.g., bul k density, porosity, thermal conductivity, and shear strength); however, data from the two summit sites, at the active spring areas observed from the ROV Jason $I I_{i}$ , indicate that serpentinite muds a t these sites were underconsolidated.  

For example, the porosity data collected during Expedition 36 6 followed two trends (Figure F12). One trend was defined by dat a from summit Sites U1492 and U1496 and ODP Site 780 (Conica l Seamount). At each of these sites, porosity decreases with dept h from seafloor values of $60\%{-}70\%$ to values of $45\%{-}55\%$ at $120\,\mathrm{mbsf}.$ An exponential trend was fit to the Site U1492 data, resulting in a n Athy’s coefficient (Athy, 1930) of 0.36, indicating that this summi t site is slightly underconsolidated (Bekins and Dreiss, 1992). Bot h sites (U1492 and U1496) are located in areas of fluid discharg e where discharge rates exceed $10\ \mathrm{cm/y}$ (Hulme et al., 2010). Thes e sites targeted our best estimate for the location of the current conduit for fluid and material flow from depth. A slight compaction ef

Also shown are porosities from ODP Leg 125 Sites 778 and 779 (flan k sites) and 780 (summit site). Green and yellow correspond to sites that diffe r from common flank or summit values, respectively.  

![](images/06e6fd4257d1e200be0d5e756846a854a1c9cf2f3dbcc93e299bcf5a3ef61b1f.jpg)  

fect is suggested in Holes U1492A and U1492B by the overall increasing trend in gamma ray attenuation (GRA) density wit h depth, whereas Hole U1492C, the closest one to the presumptiv e conduit, has lower GRA values and a rather constant trend to th e bottom of the hole $({\sim}130~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) (Figure F13). Likewise, consolidation and compaction trends with depth in Hole U1496A at Asùt Tesoru Seamount show a slight increase of bulk density, but no suc h trend was observed in Hole U1496B. The rather constant GRA bul k density and porosity values observed in Holes U1492C and U1496B, both located less than $20\;\mathrm{m}$ from the presumptive conduit area, appear to be influenced by overpressured fluids localized in the immediate region of the central conduit system, which minimized th e compaction of serpentinite mud deposits at these holes. In contrast, GRA density increases in Holes U1492A, U1492B, and U1496A suggest this overpressure effect associated with the conduit system i s not effective 50 to $100~\mathrm{m}$ from the area with the most active flui d discharge. A width of less than ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ for the active conduit a t Yinazao and Asùt Tesoru Seamounts is consistent with conduit diameters described for other mud volcanoes, which are considerabl y smaller than the size of the mud volcanoes themselves (Krastel et al., 2003).  

There is a greater decrease in porosity, however, with depth a t the other sites (mostly flank sites) to porosity values less than $30\%$ a t only 40 mbsf. The Athy coefficient fit at Site U1494, for example, i s 17.3—unreasonably high for a compaction trend. Below $40~\mathrm{mbsf},$ ,

porosity values stabilize and remain fairly constant with depth. Suc h low porosities (and high Athy coefficients) are suggestive of processes other than compaction being responsible for the observe d data.  

Although similar, there are slight peculiarities in data from th e other sites. Even the two sites located on the edge of seamount summits, Sites U1495 and U1497, show behavior more typical of flan k sites. The porosity trend at Site U1495 resembles that at flank site s on other seamounts but is more extreme, decreasing from $57\%$ t o $36\%$ at only 4 mbsf.  

The third summit site (Site U1497 on Fantangisña Seamount) i s distinct from the other two summit sites. The porosity trend wit h depth is comparable to those described for the other flank sites (Figure F12). These trends suggest that either the mud volcano has no t been active recently or subsurface flow in this area was either diffuse, compartmentalized, and not necessarily vertical or was following trends in local faults associated with the slump features at th e summit.  

# Downhole measurements  

Temperature measurements using the advanced piston core r temperature tool (APCT-3) were attempted 14 times, resulting in 1 1 records that were used to estimate formation temperatures. Thes e estimates were combined with measured seafloor temperatures an d thermal conductivities from collected cores to calculate heat flo w for the three summit sites and two of the flank sites (Table T6). Th e summit heat flow values range from 16.8 to $17.8~\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m^{2}}$ , wherea s the two flank sites range from 30.5 to $40.0\mathrm{~mW/m^{2}}$ (Figure F14) . These values and differences are consistent with data from the summit of South Chamorro Seamount, which average $15\,\mathrm{\mW/m^{2}}$ i n ODP Holes 1200A and 1200E (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002), and those collected on the flanks of Conical Seamount at DSD P Sites 458 and 459 (Uyeda and Horai, 1982).

Wireline logging was conducted in Hole U1498B after penetrating to 260 mbsf. The triple combo tool string was used to measur e magnetic susceptibility, natural gamma radiation (NGR), electrical resistivity, borehole diameter, and temperature of borehole fluids. The downhole logging data show excellent agreement with the shipboard data. The NGR data are consistent with $9\textrm{m}$ of pelagic sediment at the sediment/water interface that was not recovered durin g coring operations and registered the cherty limestone and metabasalt units. Two possible layers of pelagic sediments, one each a t 118 and 137 mbsf intercalated within the serpentinite (e.g., pal e streaks in intervals 366-U1498B-13R-4, $21{-}25\;\mathrm{cm}$ , and 15R-3, 6–1 0 cm). Here, peaks in NGR values are at similar levels to those of Uni t

Figure F15. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetic intensity of the uppermost $40\;\mathsf{m}$ after $20~\mathsf{m T}$ AF demagnetization, Expedition 366. All sites are included except Site U1495, which penetrated to only ${\sim}10$ mbsf. High magnetic intensity relative to magnetic susceptibility in some cores and holes is likely due to drill string overprint. Asùt Tesoru holes have a higher average susceptibility than the other mud volcanoes.  

I, presumable ash-rich pelagic sediments that are thought to exist in the upper $9\textrm{m}$ of Hole U1498A. Additional evidence for layers of pelagic sediment is the lack of evidence in the resistivity data for clasts. The resistivity data were useful for detecting large clasts.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The new 2G Enterprises superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM; liquid helium free) was installed at the start of Expedition 366. Paleomagnetic analyses of archive halves and representative discrete samples were performed. The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of almost all section halves was measured at $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals  after  0,  5,  10,  15,  and $20\ \mathrm{~mT~}$ alternating  field  (AF) demagnetization steps. The use of principal component analyses provided consistent NRM inclination and declination values between section halves and discrete samples.  

A pervasive vertical magnetic overprint was imparted to the cores, likely by the drilling process. In some cases, overprinting was largely demagnetized by AF demagnetization in peak fields of $5\;\mathrm{mT}$ ; in many intervals, however, enough of the overprint remains after the $20\,\mathrm{~mT~}$ demagnetization step that inclination values remain anomalously high. The axial dipole inclination was expected to be between $29.5^{\circ}$ and $33.2^{\circ}$ at the latitude $(15.8^{\circ}{-}18.1^{\circ}\mathrm{N})$ of coring operations. We searched for paleomagnetic reversals for magnetostratigraphic dating in the volcanic ash-rich pelagic sediments that overlie the serpentinite muds, but no clear reversals were found. In some cores, a particularly high intensity overprint was observed between 3 and $5\;\mathrm{m}$ above the base of the core, for example, Cores 366- U1492C-5F and 8F (Figure F15).  

Magnetic susceptibility levels are generally high, reflecting the high concentrations of magnetic minerals, particularly magnetite, in the cores. Magnetite was of interest because it was produced during serpentinization reactions, to a greater or lesser extent depending on the iron content of the initial minerals. Magnetic susceptibility is higher at the Asùt Tesoru sites, averaging over $1000~\times$ $10^{-5}$ SI compared to the other two mud volcanoes (Figure F15). There is some local correlation between magnetic susceptibility levels and the color of the serpentinite mud, but no correlation across all of the sites. In Hole U1496A, for example, the darker mud between 26 and 27 mbsf has five times lower susceptibility than the surrounding pale green serpentinite mud, whereas in Hole U1493B, the pale green serpentinite mud at 20–23 mbsf has much lower susceptibility than the blue-gray mud above and below it.  

Magnetic intensities are high, given the high concentrations o f magnetic minerals, but there is an unexpectedly large range of intensity values (Figure F15). At Site U1496, the paleomagnetic intensity is relatively low and correlates with magnetic susceptibility, a s expected from a consistent lithology and magnetization process. A t other sites, however, magnetic intensity is relatively high compare d to magnetic susceptibility, and the correlation between the two i s less clear, perhaps due to the difficulty in demagnetizing the variable overprint in many of these cores. NRM intensity generall y ranges from $1.0\times10^{-3}$ to $1.0\;\mathrm{A/m}$ , reaching maximum values of 1 0 $\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1494A in dark bluish gray serpentinite pebbly mud. Generally, ultramafic rock clasts present relatively high values o f both magnetization and bulk magnetic susceptibility in discret e samples.  

# Cased borehole operations and results  

Each of the four serpentinite mud volcanoes visited during Expedition  366  (Yinazao,  Fantangisña,  Asùt  Tesoro,  and  Sout h Chamorro Seamounts) included a borehole operational component. The goal was to deploy an infrastructure that intersected a n active hydrologic flow of deep-sourced fluid along a continuum o f conditions across the forearc. These boreholes include screene d sections to allow formation fluids to enter and are designed for future deployments of CORK-Lites (Wheat et al., 2012). This construct will enable the community to use the boreholes for scientifi c endeavors, including but not limited to monitoring physical an d chemical changes, in situ passive experimentation, and manipulative experiments to address a range of potential scientific question s that center on geophysical, geochemical, and/or microbial studies. A CORK-Lite has a modular design that includes multiple ports fo r experiments and sensors inside or outside of the CORK body an d for large-diameter $(25\;\mathrm{cm})$ experiments and sensors to be deploye d within the boreholes, which can be either sealed or allowed to discharge.  

# South Chamorro Seamount (Site 1200)  

Given the limitations of the original-style CORK that was deployed at Site 1200 during Leg 195, the plan was to remove th e CORK body, thus leaving the hole open for a future ROV deployment of a CORK-Lite (Wheat et al., 2012). While attempting to remove the CORK body, the latch rods failed to remove the portion o f the CORK that latches into the casing hanger, forming a seal an d focusing discharge up a steel pipe that contains the seal sleeve. Thi s steel pipe parted above the seal sleeve. However, the CORK is likel y sealed with access to the underlying casing via a portion of a PV C insert that was deployed in 2009, providing a conduit for futur e sampling activities. The recovered CORK body included white an d reddish material on the outside that was collected for microbial an d mineralogical analyses. About seven limpets also were recovere d from the CORK body and preserved for shore-based identification.  

# Yinazao (Site U1492), Fantangisña (Site U1497), and Asùt Tesoro (Site U1496) Seamounts  

A casing string was deployed after an initial hole was drilled int o the summit region at Yinazao, Fantangisña, and Asùt Tesoro Seamounts. The casing string included at least three joints of screene d casing, placing the screened casing as deep as possible and well below the near-surface microbial “transition” layer (e.g., Mottl et al., 2003). Difficulties experienced during the deployment of the firs t casing string changed the depth and design of the second and thir d deployments.  

The initial borehole casing string was deployed at Site U1492 . This casing string was $211~\mathrm{m}$ long with a screened section at 153– 199 mbsf. The other two casing strings were shorter $\langle{\sim}110\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{long}\rangle$ with screened sections at ${\sim}35{-}70$ mbsf. A cement plug was deployed at the base of each of the three casing strings because of  a failure during the deployment of a mechanical bridge plug at Sit e U1492; however, later operations did break the bridge plug free s o the base of the casing string could be cemented. These cementin g operations were important because serpentinite material flowe d into the base of the casing string at Site U1496 within hours of landing the casing within the casing hanger, filling the bottom $7\,\mathrm{m}$ of th e open cased hole. We returned to two of the three boreholes (Site s U1496 and U1497) to check the status of the cement and collect  a water sample with the water-sampling temperature probe (WSTP ) within these two boreholes. We did not have time to return to th e cased borehole at Site U1492 after cementing operations.  

The cement plug was reached at both sites (U1496 and U1497 ) several days after cementing operations. The cement was in place a s planned and likely sealed the boreholes from intruding material. Water samples were collected from the middle of the uppe r screened casing joint at both sites. Analysis of this water indicates  a mixture of seawater and formation fluid. The Site U1496 sample includes the highest dissolved gas measurements made during the expedition, highlighting the importance of sampling formation fluid s directly, thus without the artifacts induced by the coring and sampl e handling process.  

Each of the three new boreholes tapped an active hydrologi c zone with formation fluids that discharge into the casing and vent a t the seafloor. By deploying a CORK-Lite with an ROV, the community will be able to collect pristine fluids (especially dissolved gases ) that are unaffected by sampling artifacts. The community will als o be able to collect and/or filter tens to thousands of liters of formation fluid for chemical, microbial, and viral analyses, volumes tha t are not possible to obtain during standard IODP coring operations. The deployment of CORK-Lites also opens the cased boreholes to  a range of sensors, samplers, and experiments that will allow scientists to build a network of borehole observatories, monitoring, an d manipulations at the seafloor or within the borehole and with th e boreholes sealed or open to discharge.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 366 successfully cored the flanks and summit regions of three Mariana forearc serpentinite mud volcanoes, each located  at  varying  depth  to  the  subducting  Pacific  plate,  t o characterize processes associated with the formation and activity o f these mud volcanoes. The expedition was designed to examine subduction-related processes in terms of the relationship between geochemical  cycling,  seismicity,  and  deep  biosphere  activity  i n subduction zones and in the lithosphere of the subducting plate. The intent of the expedition was to address how these processe s vary spatially along the strike of the Mariana system and with dept h to the subduction channel ${\sim}13\$ to $19\,\mathrm{km}$ below). The results fro m this expedition complement those from previous Legs 125 and 19 5 at two other serpentinite mud volcanoes, Conical and Sout h Chamorro Seamounts, both farther from the trench than the thre e edifices cored during Expedition 366.  

Previous drilling during Leg 125 used rotary coring, and poo r recovery failed to provide much of the mudflow matrix in which th e rock clasts were entrained. Leg 195 used APC/XCB coring and recovered many thin mudflows, some with more than $100\%$ recovery, because the matrix contained gases that expanded upon recovery. During Expedition 366, all three coring systems were used, each fo r a specific purpose. Drilling results during Legs 125 and 195 prove d that the mudflows contain, in part, materials from the subductio n channel below the edifices. Expedition 366 recovered a greater diversity of subduction channel material from closer to the Marian a Trench, thus from shallower depth-to-slab than material recovere d in the two previous legs. Rock clasts and matrix muds from the serpentinite flows recovered during Expedition 366 provide a far bette r view of the regional processes that have affected the forearc. Furthermore, the cased holes with screened sections that were drille d into the summit regions of these three mud volcanoes now constitute the first regional laboratory for monitoring subduction-relate d phenomena in the trench-proximal region of a nonaccretionary, intraoceanic, convergent plate margin.  

We achieved or will achieve with shore-based analyses all four o f the overarching scientific goals outlined in the Expedition 366 Scientific Prospectus. These goals were to assess (1) mass transpor t processes in the Mariana forearc region, (2) spatial variability o f slab-related fluids, (3) metamorphic and tectonic history and physical properties of the subduction zone, and (4) biological activity associated with deep-derived subduction zone material. Associate d with these four scientific goals are nine specific objectives, described below.  

1. Core mudflows on the flanks of each mud volcano and recover conduit muds from areas near active springs on the summit of each mud volcano.  

This objective allowed us to address both construction histor y and transport processes. We recovered serpentinite mudflows wit h variable characteristics on the flank of each edifice from Site s U1491 (Yinazao Seamount), U1493, U1494, U1495 (Asùt Tesor u Seamount), and U1498 (Fantangisña Seamount). The serpentinit e mudflow matrix varies in color with depth, and although it was distinctly disturbed by flow-in during APC and XCB coring, it doe s preserve discrete horizons of clast content and matrix constituents. The cause of the color change in the serpentinite muds is not obvious and will become the focus of several proposed shore-base d studies. Although we were without X-ray diffraction or X-ray fluorescence instruments during Expedition 366, samples analyzed wit h a pXRF and ICP-AES showed essentially no difference in the majo r elements between the compositions of the serpentinized rock clast s and muds from seamount to seamount, except for specific majo r and trace elements that are sensitive to redistribution by fluid-roc k exchange processes. The latter elements showed more variable patterns in the matrix and fluid data, indicating a regional consistenc y with depth-to-slab. Expedition 366 results confirm the broad interpretation of gravity core, piston core, and submersible/ROV pus h core work over the past decade that revealed a regional gradient i n terms of change in the composition of slab-related fluids with dept h to the subduction channel, as recorded by the fluids dischargin g from active springs in serpentinite mud volcanoes. The enhancement of this finding as a result of Expedition 366 was that the sourc e of most of the fluids is initially prehnite-pumpellyite facies dehydration followed by greenschist alteration and lastly blueschist dehydration and mobilization of fluid mobile elements. For example, boron and potassium data show drastic increases in the concentration in muds and fluids with distance from the trench.  

There remain questions regarding the eruptive processes. Suc h questions would be better addressed through monitoring. For example, how variable are the volumes of erupted materials, how doe s the rate of fluid discharge and the stress field change during activ e episodes of eruption, and what controls the eruptive cycle? Th e planned CORK-Lite installations at the cased boreholes will be instrumental in addressing temporal-related questions.  

# 2. Date discrete mudflows paleontologically, should there be sediment layers between them.  

Dating discrete layers will better our understanding of the episodicity of the eruptions and how differences among episodes ma y affect transport processes. Dating will be possible because we recovered pelagic sediment overlying flank serpentinite mudflow s and were able to penetrate the underlying forearc sediments at tw o of the holes on Fantangisña Seamount’s flank. We recovered interlayered mudflows of clay-sized serpentinite mud of a wide variety o f oxidized and unoxidized material, as well as interlayered pelagi c sediments on the distal edges of Fantangisña Seamount. Very fe w rock clasts were found in these mudflows. Also, beneath the serpentinite on Fantangisña Seamount, we recovered ash-rich sediment with abundant microfossils. Biostratigraphic ages for th e recovered sediments will be determined on shore. The recovery o f this material is reminiscent of that in the deepest sediment interval (near Eocene igneous basement) in Hole 459 (Leg 60), which is located south of Asùt Tesoro Seamount (Despraires, 1982).  

# 3. Determine variability in the composition of rock clasts in the mudflows.  

The anticipated discovery of subduction channel physical an d compositional properties was realized through the recovery of numerous rock clasts. Peridotite rock clasts were present in the core s from each of the three seamounts that were drilled. They includ e dunites, harzburgites, and pyroxenites and vary in degree of serpentinization from $30\%$ to $100\%$ . The less serpentinized peridotite s preserve relict olivine and orthopyroxene that will make it possibl e to use crystal preferred orientation analysis to study the history o f stress distribution, both across- and along-strike of the entir e southern Mariana suprasubduction-zone mantle wedge. Core s from the flanks of the mud volcanoes included microfossils in som e mudflow intervals and beneath the distal flank of Fantangisña Seamount. Paleontologic age ranges from these will be determined t o constrain temporal aspects of the history of mantle stress patterns.  

We also discovered striking variability in the lithology of othe r rock clasts within the mudflows, and the results of shipboard observations and analysis show that all five of the serpentinite seamount s cored to date (including Leg 125 and 195 cores) contain lithologie s from the subducted slab. The fact that all of these mud volcanoe s tapped slab-derived fluids and erupt rock clasts from the subduction channel confirms that these edifices are indeed natural windows to slab processes. The range of recovered material fro m Expedition 366 is particularly illuminating because we recovere d fosilliferous reef limestones and metavolcanics with alkalic provenance, as well as compositions consistent with ocean island basalts. These lithologies indicate a source from subducted Pacific plate an d seamounts on it.  

Also collected were clasts that span the entire range of lithospheric  compositions  known  to  have  formed  in  the  suprasubduction-zone  region  of  the  Mariana  forearc  crust.  Thus, Expedition 366 results also confirm that serpentinite mud volcanoes erupt the entire suite of rock materials that represent the subsurface architecture of the Mariana arc. The fact that the mu d volcanoes occur exclusively in association with forearc scarps suggests that vertical tectonism of the forearc is the rule rather than th e exception.  

4. Study potential systematic variability in the degree of serpentinization of rock clasts and distinguish the characteristics of the mudflow matrix on the flanks from those in the summit conduit regions.  

Coring on the flanks of the edifices revealed for the first tim e that there is systematic increase in the degree of serpentinization o f rock clasts and of secondary mineralization of the mudflow matri x with increasing depth down the flanks of the mud volcanoes. Mos t ultramafic clasts recovered from the flanks reacted to a greater extent with muds that are generally $100\%$ serpentinized. Furthermore, individual serpentinized rock clasts are soft enough to indent with  a fingernail. Reaction of the clasts with the matrix muds is eviden t where halos surround clasts and darken the adjacent mud. The degree of serpentinization in ultramafic clasts is variable in the summit regions, where episodicity of activity in the conduits of thes e edifices may cause pulsing, presumably on various timescales, of th e mud matrix and fluids and may refresh the throat with new and les s reacted materials.  

5. Examine transport conditions of muds and interstitial waters on the seamount flanks.  

Transport conditions of muds and interstitial waters are remarkably variable on the flanks and in the summit regions of the seamounts. Changes in the density and porosity of mudflows on th e flanks of the seamounts indicate that compaction is not the onl y force that affects trends in these physical properties with depth. Additionally, deformation by gravitational sliding (Oakley et al., 2007 ) may affect these profiles, as can continued serpentinization and alteration to other phases that significantly reduce porosity. Cause s for these changes in physical properties will be assessed in shorebased mineralogical analysis and rheologic studies of whole-roun d samples. The latter were collected and preserved for mechanical, stress, and permeability testing, including the determination o f physical properties.  

6. Provide a measure for comparing the nature of hydrologic characteristics (e.g., diffuse versus channelized fluid flow) on the flanks and summit regions of the mud volcanoes.  

Systematic variations in interstitial water composition profile s from flank sites indicate no significant vertical discharge of fluids. At each of the summit sites, interstitial water compositions sho w clear evidence of seepage at discharge rates in excess of the serpentinite matrix, which also is ascending and constructing th e dome-like features on the summit of two of the three seamount s that were cored. These results are consistent with published dat a that define the range and area of discharge at the summit sites.  

7. Determine the composition of fluid from depth and assess the type, extent, and effect of diagenetic reactions that occurred on the flanks of serpentinite mud volcanoes.  

Systematic variations in interstitial water composition profile s from Yinazao ( $13\,\mathrm{km}$ depth-to-slab), Fantangisña $\left(14\,\mathrm{km}\right)$ , and Asù t Tesoru $:18~\mathrm{km}$ ) Seamounts augment previous results from Sout h Chamorro $\mathrm{[}18\,\mathrm{km)}$ and Conical $\left(19\,\mathrm{km}\right)$ Seamounts (Table T1). Thi s combination of data extends the dramatic change, noted in previou s studies (Mottl et al., $2004;$ Hulme et al., 2010), in the composition s of the slab-derived serpentinizing fluids as the subduction channe l deepens. Dramatic differences include elevated Ca and Sr and lo w to extremely low K, Na, Cl, $\mathrm{SO}_{4},$ B, and $\mathrm{Na}/\mathrm{Cl}$ in fluids from Yinaza o Seamount and, to a lesser extent, Fantangisña Seamount. In contrast, discharging fluids from Asùt Tesoru Seamount have a composition similar to that from South Chamorro and Conical Seamounts, with extremely high $\mathsf{p H}$ (up to 12.48), Ca and Sr depletions, an d marked enrichments in carbonate alkalinity, DIC, DOC, $\mathrm{NH}_{4},$ Na, $\mathrm{K},\,\mathrm{Na}/\mathrm{Cl},$ and B. Na concentrations are higher at Asùt Tesoru Seamount than at any the five seamounts mentioned above. Chemical compositions of interstitial water from the flank sites are consisten t with a mixture of slab-derived fluid and seawater. Superimposed o n this mixture are diagenetic changes that are evident in some of th e measured chemical species.  

Coupled to the seventh objective was the desire to document th e composition of dissolved gases, specifically $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ $\mathrm{CH}_{4},$ and ${\cal C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{6}$ . Compositions of these gases differed from site to site, providing  a measure of deep-sourced fluid composition. High concentrations o f $\mathrm{H}_{2},\mathrm{CH}_{4},$ and $\mathrm{C_{2}H_{6}}$ were observed at the summit of Asùt Tesoru Seamount, and comparatively low but significant levels were detecte d at both summit and flank sites at Yinazao Seamount. Concentrations of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ show two distinct groupings: serpentinizationdriven $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ production and methane production. The relationshi p between methane and ethane data from Asùt Tesoru, Sout h Chamorro, and Conical Seamounts converge on a single composition that may represent the hydrocarbon values produced by abioti c (Fisher Tropsch Type) synthesis in the deep-sourced fluid.  

8. Collect samples for the study of microbial/viral community interactions in materials bathed in deep-sourced fluids, distal serpentinite mud flows, and the underlying forearc pelagic sediment.  

Whole-round samples collected for microbiological studie s were subsampled for shore-based analyses to explore the limits o f microbial life in serpentinite mud using cultivation-based and cultivation-independent molecular biological approaches, microscopy, and assays for the detection of viruses. Postexpedition analyses will include an array of microbial community–level interrogation techniques: (1) total cell counts to quantify microbial biomass; (2) cultivation (including FACS high-throughput media screening an d detection of adaptation to physical parameters such as pressure tolerance); (3) molecular analyses, including SSU ribosomal gene amplicon sequencing (to address community structure in greate r detail), functional gene detection, and quantification through qPC R and single-cell genomics (to specifically address individual cell contributions); (4) metagenomics of the entire microbial communit y and metatranscriptomics of the most highly expressed genes to establish metabolic potential and deeper ecological and evolutionar y relationships; and (5) viral counts and diversity. The only microbial analysis conducted at sea was to assess the quality of the whol e rounds via tracer analysis. Tracers were pumped into the drill strin g prior to and during core recovery. Systematic sampling of the core d material and overlying surficial fluids indicates that most of th e whole-round samples for microbiology are suitable for continue d shore-based analyses.  

# 9. Complete initial fabrication of borehole structures for future in situ experiments and observations.  

Three casing strings, each with three or more joints of screene d casing, were deployed, one in each of the summits of the cored serpentinite mud volcanoes. These casing strings form the foundatio n for a future deployment of CORK-Lites (Wheat et al., 2012), whic h allow for a range of experiments and observations to be conducte d simultaneously within a single structure that is open to deepsourced fluids. We collected a water sample and measured temperature within two of the three newly deployed cased boreholes day s after the bottom was sealed with cement. The recovered fluids wer e a mixture of seawater (drilling fluids) and deep-sourced fluid, an d temperatures were higher than expected based on measurement s collected during serpentinite mud coring operations. Combined, these data indicate that both boreholes tapped a hydrologic zon e and active fluid discharge exists. The third site also should have active discharge based on systematic variations in interstitial wate r composition profiles that indicate fluid discharge rates of centimeters to tens of centimeters per year in the summit area. Similar results were observed at South Chamorro Seamount, which support s a CORK (Hole 1200C) with active fluid discharge. During Expedition 366, we visited Hole 1200C to remove the CORK body. Most o f the CORK body from Hole 1200C was removed, leaving the sleev e joint that allows access to the CORK, but it retains the 3.25 inch diameter. Thus, with future funding and ROV operations, a networ k of four cased borehole observatory systems will exist that span  a range of distances from the trench, representing a variety of pressure and temperature conditions at depth and different compositions of deep-sourced fluids. Such a transect will be instrumental t o in situ experimentation and future monitoring for the study of, fo r example, processes associated with material (e.g., rocks, fluid, an d mud) flow and alteration (e.g., abiotic and biotic reactions).
