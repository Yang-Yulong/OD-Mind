# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 37 1 drilled six sites (U1506–U1511) in the Tasman Sea, southwest Pacific, between 27 July and 26 September 2017. The primary goal wa s to understand Tonga-Kermadec subduction initiation through recovery of Paleogene sediment records. Secondary goals were to understand regional oceanography and climate through intervals o f the Cenozoic, especially the Eocene. We recovered $2506\;\mathrm{m}$ of core d sediment and volcanic rock in 36.4 days of on-site drilling over a total expedition length of 58 days. The ages of strata at the base o f each site were middle Eocene to Late Cretaceous. The cored intervals at five sites (U1506–U1510) sampled mostly nannofossil an d foraminiferal ooze or chalk that contained volcanic or volcaniclasti c intervals with variable clay content. Paleocene and Cretaceous sections at Site U1509 also contain calcareous clay and claystone. A t Site U1511, a sequence of abyssal clay and diatomite was recovere d with only minor amounts of carbonate. Wireline logs were collecte d at Sites U1507 and U1508.  

Our results provide the first firm basis for correlating lithostratigraphic units across a substantial part of northern Zealandia, including ties to onshore geology in New Caledonia and Ne w Zealand.  All  six  sites  provide  new  stratigraphic  and  paleogeographic information that can be put into context through regional  seismic  stratigraphic  interpretation  and  hence  provid e constraints on geodynamic models of subduction zone initiation. Evidence from Site U1507 suggests the northern New Caledoni a Trough formed during an early stage of Paleogene tectonic chang e (before $44\;\mathrm{Ma}$ ). Paleowater depth estimates from Site U1509 indicate that the Cretaceous Fairway-Aotea-Taranaki Basin dramatically deepened ${\bf\left\langle{\sim}2000{\ m}\right\rangle}$ at a similar time. Northern Lord How e Rise at Site U1506 rose to sea level at ${\sim}50$ Ma and subsided back t o bathyal depths $(600{-}1000\;\mathrm{m})$ by $45\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . In contrast, southern Lor d Howe Rise, at least near Site U1510, experienced its peak of transient uplift at ${\sim}40{-}30\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . A pulse of convergent plate failure too k place across the southern part of the region (Sites U1508–U1511 ) between 45 and $35\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Uplift of Lord Howe Rise was associate d with intraplate volcanism, whereas volcanic activity on Norfol k Ridge near Site U1507 started at $\mathord{\sim}38$ Ma and may relate to subduction.  

Shipboard observations made using cores and logs represent  a substantial gain in fundamental knowledge about northern Zealandia. Prior to Expedition 371, only Deep Sea Drilling Project Site s 206, 207, and 208 had penetrated beneath upper Eocene strata i n the region. Our samples and results provide valuable new constraints on geodynamic models of subduction initiation becaus e they reveal the timing of plate deformation, the magnitude and timing of vertical motions, and the timing and type of volcanism. Secondary drilling objectives focused on paleoclimate topics were no t fully completed, but significant new records were obtained tha t should contain information on Cenozoic oceanography and climat e in the southwest Pacific.  

# Introduction  

The Tasman Frontier encompasses an extensive, geologicall y complex, and underexplored area of the ocean between Australia, New Zealand, and New Caledonia (Figure F1). It includes a vas t submerged portion of the Zealandia continent (Mortimer et al., 2017) and lies west of the prominent Tonga-Kermadec Trench system. The primary goal of International Ocean Discovery Progra m (IODP) Expedition 371 was to understand Tonga-Kermadec subduction initiation through recovery of Paleogene sediment record s at six new sites across the Tasman Frontier (Figures F1, F2, F3, F4).  

Subduction systems are primary drivers of plate motions, mantle dynamics, and global geochemical cycles, but little is know n about how subduction starts. What are the initial conditions? Ho w do forces and kinematics evolve? What are the short-term consequences and surface signatures: uplift, subsidence, deep-water sedimentary basins, convergence, extension, and volcanism? The earl y Eocene onset of subduction in the western Pacific was accompanie d by a profound global reorganization of tectonic plates, with know n plate motions before and after the change (Billen and Gurnis, 2005; Sharp and Clague, 2006; Steinberger et al., 2004; Whittaker et al., 2007). The Izu-Bonin-Mariana (e.g., IODP Expeditions 350, 351, and 352) and Tonga-Kermadec systems contain complementary information about subduction initiation (Figure F1), but the southwest Pacific has had little relevant drilling.  

Eocene tectonic change occurred at a turning point in Cenozoi c climate. Long-term global warming through the Paleocene–Eocen e transition culminated in the Early Eocene Climatic Optimu m (EECO; ${\sim}53{-}49~\mathrm{\Ma})$ ), which was followed by overall  coolin g through the remainder of the Cenozoic (Figure F5) (Zachos et al., 2008; Westerhold et al., 2018). The Paleocene and Eocene were als o punctuated by an unknown number of geologically brief events o f extreme warmth, biological turnover, and geochemical change commonly referred to as “hyperthermals” (Zachos et al., 2008; Westerhold et al., 2018).

A secondary scientific goal of Expedition 371 was to better understand the long-term and short-term transitions during the earl y Paleogene. Why did Earth’s climate move between multimillionyear greenhouse and icehouse climate states? Was this related t o tectonic change, particularly as expressed by widespread initiatio n of subduction zones in the western Pacific? How do the hyperthermal events fit into broader early Cenozoic change? The Tasma n Frontier is a special location to address such questions. Under ver y high $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ conditions or high climate sensitivity, global climat e models can reasonably simulate early Eocene warming in many regions (Huber and Caballero, 2011; Lunt et al., 2012) but not the extreme warmth previously reported in the southwest Pacific an d Southern Ocean (Bijl et al., 2009; Hollis et al., 2009, 2012; Pross e t al., 2012; Douglas et al., 2014). Moreover, the EECO and most of th e established hyperthermals are exposed in several uplifted marin e sections of New Zealand (Nicolo et al., 2007; Hollis et al., 2009, 2012; Slotnick et al., 2012).  

The Eocene–Oligocene transition and Neogene paleoceanography have been subjects of numerous scientific drilling expeditions, including Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Legs 21, 29, an d 90 (Figure F2). Results from these three previous expeditions in th e Tasman Sea were highly influential in the development of ideas tha t connected regional oceanography with thermal isolation and glaciation of Antarctica and hence global climate change (Burns and Andrews, 1973; Kennett, 1977; Kennett et al., 1975; Kennett and vo n der Borch, 1986). Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 181 and 18 9 further investigated the Eocene–Oligocene opening of the souther n Tasman Sea gateway (Carter et al., 2004; Exon et al., 2004b). A ke y line of evidence for this history revolves around the presence o f widespread unconformities in the Tasman Sea. However, regiona l vertical tectonics or local faulting has not been considered (Sutherland et al., 2010, 2017). Records from the Tasman Sea may also offe r insights into understanding pan-Pacific paleoceanography durin g the Neogene (Grant and Dickens, 2002; Karas et al., 2011).

# Scientific background  

# Subduction initiation and global plate tectonics  

Subduction initiation and changes in plate motion are linked because the largest driving and resisting tectonic forces occur in subduction zones (Becker and O’Connell, 2001; Buffett, 2006; LithgowBertelloni and Richards, 1998; Stadler et al., 2010). Subduction initiation models have two end-member classes: induced or spontaneous (Stern, 2004) (Figure F6). In the spontaneous model, oceani c lithosphere ages, cools, increases in density and gravitational instability, and sinks into the mantle under its own weight (Stern an d Bloomer, 1992; Turcotte et al., 1977). In the induced model, externally applied compressive stress and convergence is necessary t o overcome lithospheric strength before convective instability ca n grow and subduction initiates (McKenzie, 1977; Toth and Gurnis, 1998).  

Half of all presently active subduction zones on Earth bega n during the Cenozoic (Gurnis et al., 2004), so it is possible to assemble observations to address the question of how and why these margins evolved into self-sustaining subduction zones. Recent drillin g results from Expedition 351 shed light on this question, and ne w models suggest juxtaposition of a transcurrent fault and relict ar c could have led to Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction initiation just before $50\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Leng and Gurnis, 2015). Subduction initiation at a passive continental margin has received considerable attention throug h the concept of a Wilson cycle (a class of the spontaneous model), but no known Cenozoic examples of passive margins evolving int o subduction zones exist (Stern, 2004). Spontaneous and induce d models predict different states of stress and vertical motions durin g their early stages, and recovering evidence to distinguish thes e states underpinned our drilling strategy.  

The largest change in global plate motions since $84\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (the onl y period with precisely known plate kinematics) is manifest as th e Emperor-Hawaii seamount chain bend (Figure F1). Geochronolog y shows the Emperor-Hawaii bend started at ${\sim}50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ and may hav e occurred over ${\sim}8$ My (Sharp and Clague, 2006). The onset of Pacifi c plate motion change corresponds to the timing of Pacific/Farallo n plate boundary rearrangement (Caress et al., 1988) and terminatio n of spreading in the Tasman Sea (Gaina et al., 1998), followed by  a change in direction and rapid increase in rate of Australia-Antarcti c spreading with consequent northward acceleration of Australi a (Müller et al., 2000; Seton et al., 2012; Whittaker et al., 2007) an d initiation of Australia-Pacific spreading south of New Zealan d (Keller, 2003; Sutherland, 1995; Wood et al., 1996). Eocene emplacement of ophiolites and deformed flysch may record the onset o f convergence in New Caledonia (Aitchison et al., 1995). Reconfiguration of plate boundaries in Antarctica (Cande et al., 2000), the Indian Ocean (Cande et al., 2010), and Asia (Aitchison et al., 2007 ) confirms the global extent of tectonic change.  

The westward swerve in Pacific plate motion occurred at abou t the same time as subduction zones initiated throughout the wester n Pacific (Gurnis et al., 2004; Hall et al., 2003; Steinberger et al., 2004). Reconstructing what happened in the western Pacific is of fundamental significance for understanding subduction initiation an d hence the physics of plate tectonics and mantle flow.  

# Early Paleogene greenhouse  

Sediment records from the early Paleogene provide insights int o Earth surface systems (e.g., climate, oceanography, biotic evolution, and geochemical cycling) when average temperatures across th e globe were much warmer than present day and the poles wer e largely free of ice (Zachos et al., 2008; Pearson et al., 2009; Pagani e t al., 2011). For example, during the EECO, mean annual sea-surfac e temperatures (SSTs) may have exceeded $38^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in the tropics an d $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at latitudes greater than $50^{\circ}$ north and south (Pearson et al., 2009; Huber and Caballero, 2011; Cramwinckel et al., 2018). The extreme warmth especially manifests in records from the southwes t Pacific region (Bijl et al., 2009; Hollis et al., 2012; Pross et al., 2012).

Figure F6. Induced vs. spontaneous subduction initiation models with possible examples (adapted from Stern, 2004; Arculus et al., 2015a).  

Theory and models link the much higher global temperatures t o elevated atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Shaffer et al., 2016). Available evidence supports this idea because atmospheri c $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ levels during the early Paleogene and especially the EEC O likely exceeded 1000 parts per million by volume (ppmv) (e.g., Pearson and Palmer, 2000; Pagani et al., 2011; Beerling and Royer, 2011). As evidenced by prominent negative excursions in $\delta^{13}C$ records an d coincident carbonate dissolution at deep seafloor locations, massiv e additions of carbon to the ocean and atmosphere also occurre d during some of the hyperthermals (Dickens et al., 1997; Zachos e t al., 2005; Lauretano et al., 2016; Westerhold et al., 2018). Indeed th e most prominent hyperthermal, the Paleocene/Eocene Therma l Maximum (PETM; ${\sim}56$ Ma) has been suggested as the outstandin g past analog for understanding current and future climate chang e caused by humans (e.g., Dickens et al., 1997; Pagani et al., 2006; McInerney and Wing, 2011; Zeebe and Zachos, 2013).  

Studying intervals of the early Paleogene should inform our understanding of Earth’s behavior under elevated temperatures an d high greenhouse gas conditions. Climate model simulations usin g either very high greenhouse gas radiative forcing or very high climate sensitivity yield mean annual temperatures consistent wit h abundant data for the early Eocene (Huber and Caballero, 2011; Lunt et al., 2012). However, at several sites in the southwest Pacific, both on and off shore (e.g., from Leg 189), multiple proxies yiel d SSTs $5^{\circ}{-}10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ warmer than predicted by model simulations (Holli s et al., 2012; Pross et al., 2012). One possibility is that modeled SS T predictions are too low because the region was influenced by  a warm southward-flowing current system (Hollis et al., 2012) unaccounted for in climate models. Another possibility is that paleobathymetry has not been depicted accurately because parts of th e Tasman Frontier were much shallower during the early Eocen e compared with present day (Sutherland et al., 2010; Baur et al., 2014).  

A fundamental geoscience question remains after decades of research: why did Earth’s climate generally cool since the late early Eocene $\left({\sim}49\,\mathrm{\textbf{Ma}}\right)$ ? Most hypotheses have invoked changes in th e amount of volcanism or weathering (e.g., Raymo and Ruddiman, 1992; Berner and Kothavala, 2001; Kent and Muttoni, 2008), whic h would affect carbon addition to or carbon removal from the ocea n and atmosphere (Berner, 1994; Ridgwell and Zeebe, 2005). A n emergent alternative view is that Eocene tectonic change drov e long-term Cenozoic climate change (Lee et al., 2013; Reagan et al., 2013). Prior to the early Eocene, most volcanic arcs were continental, where rising magma can react with carbonate-rich crust an d generate voluminous $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . However, initiation of widespread island-arc subduction systems around the Pacific during the early Eocene created a network of submarine plate boundaries that ma y have first increased and later decreased $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ fluxes to the atmosphere.  

The warming trend of the late Paleocene through early Eocene, the hyperthermal events of the early Eocene, the EECO, and subsequent cooling can be found in uplifted marine sedimentary successions of eastern New Zealand (Dallanave et al., 2015; Hancock et al., 2003; Hollis, 2006; Hollis et al., 2005; Nicolo et al., 2007; Slotnick e t al., 2012) and New Caledonia (Dallanave et al., 2018). Comparabl e lower Paleogene stratigraphic records should lie across the Tasma n Frontier and provide valuable insights to the magnitude and exten t of past global warmth, as well as possible causes.  

# Post-Eocene climate evolution  

Initial reports for Legs 21 and 29 (Burns and Andrews, 1973 ; Kennett et al., 1975) laid foundations for understanding the interplay between tectonic and oceanographic events in the region, including opening of the Tasman Sea and separation of Australia an d New Zealand from Antarctica (Andrews et al., 1975; Andrews an d Ovenshine, 1975; Edwards, 1973, 1975; Kennett et al., 1975; Kennet t and Shackleton, 1976).  

Stable isotope records generated from Leg 29 (DSDP Sites 27 7 and 279) sediment revealed a general cooling trend over the Cenozoic, with evidence for a pronounced cooling step across the Eocene–Oligocene transition. A series of landmark publications fro m these legs proposed that ocean circulation was a primary driver o f regional and global climate through the early Cenozoic, and the rol e of circumpolar gateways in the evolution of Antarctic ice sheets an d global climate was first hypothesized (Kennett, 1977; Kennett an d Shackleton, 1976; Nelson and Cooke, 2001).  

Leg 189 focused on the ocean gateway hypothesis and generate d a wealth of data and debate (Exon et al., 2004a; Kennett and Exon, 2004). Some continue to argue that opening of the Tasmanian gateway and subsequent development of the Antarctic Circumpola r Current (ACC) played a crucial role in southwest Pacific oceanography and climate (Kennett and Exon, 2004), whereas others link lat e Paleogene cooling and ice sheet growth to a tectonically driven decline in atmospheric $C O_{2}$ (DeConto and Pollard, 2003; Huber et al., 2004).  

Drilling in the broad Indo-Pacific area has documented a phenomenon coined the late Miocene–early Pliocene “biogenic bloom ” (Farrell et al., 1995; Dickens and Owen, 1999). Between about 9 an d $4\mathrm{~Ma}$ , the accumulation of biogenic components (e.g., carbonate, biosilica, and barite) increased significantly at many sites beneat h regions of modern surface water divergence. This increase is especially obvious along the Equator in the eastern Pacific (van Andel e t al., 1975; Farrell et al., 1995), in the far North Pacific (Rea et al., 1995), and along the Oman margin (Brummer and van Eijden, 1992). Eastern flow of the Eastern Australian Current (EAC) fro m Australia toward New Zealand leads to an east–west zone of surfac e water divergence referred to as the Tasman Front. At DSDP Sit e 590, which lies beneath the Tasman Front (Figure F7), carbonate accumulation rates doubled between the late Miocene and early Pliocene, consistent with the biogenic bloom phenomenon (Grant an d Dickens, 2002). The coincidence of elevated export production a t numerous locations suggests far-field oceanographic teleconnections during the Neogene, such as via an acceleration of Indo-Pacific upwelling and nutrient delivery to the photic zone.  

# Geological setting  

The seafloor beneath the Tasman Frontier represents a fascinating large-scale submarine area because a substantial portion consists of bathymetric highs and lows that lie between 750 and $3500\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figures F1, F2). Nowhere else on Earth does such a n extensive region sit on the global hyposmetric curve. This is because the bathymetric highs, the islands of New Zealand and Ne w Caledonia, and perhaps the New Caledonia Trough represent th e northern part of a submerged continent referred to as Zealandi a (Mortimer et al., 2017). Unlike other continents, most of Zealandi a lies underwater because the continental crust is relatively thin ( $\left.\sim\!20\right.$ km on average).  

Figure F7. Primary ocean currents (C), fronts (F), and gyres (G) of the Southern Ocean (after Rintoul et al., 2001). The Tasman Sea sector is affected b y the ACC and EAC.  

![](images/4b1fda6265f131a5b18e170c5af18706439b7a6921ea1df7655ab9db87f55d72.jpg)  

A lengthy subduction system lies east of northern Zealandia an d includes the Tonga and Kermadec Trenches (Figure F1). Thi s Tonga-Kermadec system has been studied much less than the IzuBonin-Mariana system but is complementary and has the followin g advantages for investigation by drilling: (1) the Tonga-Kermade c system formed adjacent to thin continental crust that early back-ar c spreading isolated from later complication by faulting or volcanism; (2) persistent submarine conditions and moderate water depths le d to preservation of fossil-rich bathyal sediment records in man y places; (3) seismic reflection data demonstrate the existence of Eocene tectonic signals of change, including compression, uplift/subsidence, and volcanism; and (4) relative motions of the Australia n and Pacific plates are precisely known (Cande and Stock, 2004; Sutherland, 1995).  

The tectonic history of the Tasman Frontier can be simplifie d into four phases with approximate ages:  

• ${>}350{-}100\,\mathrm{Ma}$ : subduction along the eastern Gondwana margin.   
• 100–80 Ma: continental rifting in the Tasman Sea region.   
• $80{-}50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ : oceanic rifting and opening of the Tasman Sea.   
• $50{-}0\;\mathrm{Ma}$ : Tonga-Kermadec subduction and related deformation.  

Continental “basement” beneath bathymetric rises in the regio n is inferred to be similar to rocks found in New Zealand, New Caledonia, and eastern Australia; this inference is supported by limite d dredge samples and drilling (DSDP Site 207), seismic velocity, an d gravity and magnetic anomalies (Collot et al., 2012; Klingelhoefer e t al., 2007; Mortimer, 2004a, 2004b; Mortimer et al., 2008; Sutherland, 1999; Tulloch et al., 1991; Wood and Woodward, 2002). Lor d Howe Rise and Challenger Plateau (Figures F3, F4) are probabl y composed of quartzose metasedimentary rocks and granitoids o f Paleozoic age that represent the eastern edge of Gondwana (Mortimer et al., 2017). High-amplitude magnetic anomalies and a singl e dredge sample from the West Norfolk Ridge suggest a fossil arc o f late Paleozoic and Mesozoic age (formed along the active margin o f Gondwana) underlies the southern New Caledonia Trough (Mortimer et al., 1998; Sutherland, 1999). The geology of New Caledoni a and northern New Zealand suggests that Norfolk Ridge is underlai n by Mesozoic fore-arc accretionary rocks formed at the convergen t margin of Gondwana (Adams et al., 2009; Aitchison et al., 1998; Cluzel et al., 2010; Cluzel and Meffre, 2002; Mortimer, 2004b). Based on comparison with eastern New Zealand (Davy et al., 2008), a “fossil” Gondwana trench lay along the northeast side of the Norfolk Ridge system and the ancient slab dipped southwest beneat h Lord Howe Rise during the Mesozoic.  

The tectonic regime along the Tasman sector of the Gondwan a margin changed during the Cretaceous from subduction and convergence to widespread rifting and extension. Igneous activity wa s widespread and of variable type and chemistry during the Cretaceous. Calc-alkaline and adakitic (high $\mathrm{Sr/Y}$ ) activity with a subduction-related signature is characteristic of the early phase $\left\langle130-\right.$ $110\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ) in New Zealand and New Caledonia, whereas an intraplat e rift setting characterizes later activity after ${\sim}105{-}100\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and is als o recorded on Lord Howe Rise (Bryan et al., 1997; Cluzel et al., 2010; Higgins et al., 2011; Mortimer et al., 1999; Tulloch et al., 2009). Lat e Cretaceous rift basins contain coastal sandstone facies overlain b y transgressive marine sandstones and mudstones in New Zealand, eastern Australia, and New Caledonia and are likely present in th e Tasman Frontier region (Collot et al., 2009; Herzer et al., 1999; Kin g and Thrasher, 1996; Uruski and Wood, 1991; Uruski, 2008). The en d of widespread rifting in New Zealand, New Caledonia, and Australia and the subsequent transition to passive margin conditions wer e contemporaneous with the onset of seafloor spreading in the Tasman Sea at ${\sim}80\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , but local normal fault activity is known to hav e continued to ${\sim}60\ \mathrm{Ma}$ in Taranaki and northern South Island, Ne w Zealand (King and Thrasher, 1996; Laird, 1993).  

Late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic seafloor spreading in the Tasman Basin is inferred from magnetic anomalies (Hayes and Ringis, 1973; Weissel and Hayes, 1977). The earliest seafloor spreading ma y predate Chron C33r $(84{-}80\ \mathrm{Ma})$ east of Tasmania (Royer and Rollet, 1997), but marginal seafloor along much of the western edge o f Lord Howe Rise probably formed during Chron C33r (Gaina et al., 1998; Sutherland, 1999). Seafloor spreading ceased in the central Tasman Sea during Chron C24 (53–52 Ma) or very shortly afterward (Gaina et al., 1998).  

Deformation, exhumation, and emplacement of ultramafic , mafic, and sedimentary allochthons occurred in New Caledoni a during the middle and late Eocene (Aitchison et al., 1995; Cluzel e t al., 2001). The peak of high-pressure metamorphism in norther n New Caledonia was at $44\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , and exhumation was largely complet e by $34\,\mathrm{\OmegaMa}$ (Baldwin et al., 2007). Seismic stratigraphic evidenc e shows that the New Caledonia Trough either formed or was substantially modified during this event, although Cretaceous sedimentary basins beneath the trough escaped Cenozoic convergen t deformation in most places (Collot et al., 2008; Sutherland et al., 2010). Regional deformation and emplacement of allochthons i n northern New Zealand occurred later than in New Caledonia or th e Norfolk Ridge system, with the onset of tectonic activity during th e late Oligocene and early Miocene $({\sim}30{-}20\ \mathrm{Ma})$ (Bache et al., 2012; Herzer, 1995; Herzer et al., 1997; Rait et al., 1991; Stagpoole an d Nicol, 2008).  

Relative motion between the Australia and Pacific plates is precisely known for the period since Chron C20 (43 Ma) because th e plate boundary south of New Zealand was extensional and a plat e

circuit through Antarctica can be followed to provide additiona l constraints (Cande and Stock, $2004;$ Keller, 2003; Sutherland, 1995). Eocene convergence rates varied from ${<}1\ \mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{y}$ in New Zealand t o $10\,\mathrm{cm/y}$ near New Caledonia (Figure F8). Late Eocene to Holocen e subduction zone roll-back has produced back-arc basins (Loyalty, Norfolk, South Fiji, North Fiji, Havre, and Lau) and ridges interpreted to be fossil and active arcs east of the Norfolk Ridge syste m (Loyalty, Three Kings, Lau-Colville, Tonga-Kermadec, and Vanuatu) (Crawford et al., 2003; Herzer et al., 2009; Herzer and Mascle, 1996; Mortimer et al., 2007; Schellart et al., 2006). The complexit y of basin opening makes local determination of past plate boundar y configurations and rates difficult. This back-arc region has no w mostly isolated the submerged continental part of the Tasman Frontier region from Cenozoic subduction-related deformation and volcanism.  

A variety of tectonic models have been proposed to explain ho w Eocene–Miocene arcs and back-arc basins formed between th e Tonga-Kermadec Trench and Norfolk Ridge (Cluzel et al., 2006; Crawford et al., 2003; Herzer et al., 2009; Mortimer et al., 2007; Schellart et al., 2006). General agreement exists that the moder n Tonga-Kermadec system evolved from a boundary lying near th e Norfolk Ridge and New Caledonia in the middle Eocene. However, ideas about the exact geometry of that boundary or the nature o f Cretaceous to middle Eocene plate boundaries northeast of Norfol k Ridge (Whattam et al., 2008) vary because the region has eithe r been subducted or deformed and intruded. The region is als o sparsely sampled.  

The oldest Cenozoic volcanic rocks from the southwest Pacifi c with clear subduction affinities were dredged from the Tonga-Kermadec fore arc and have ages in the range of 52–48 Ma (Meffre e t al., 2012). In New Caledonia, dikes with subduction affinities cu t ophiolitic rocks and are interpreted to be approximately synchronous with felsic dikes that are dated at ${\sim}53\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Cluzel et al., 2006), representing the earliest evidence for subduction and predating th e peak of high-pressure metamorphism at $44\,\mathrm{\:Ma}$ (Baldwin et al., 2007) and nappe emplacement in New Caledonia (Aitchison et al., 1995; Maurizot, 2012). Given that magnetic anomaly interpretations suggest seafloor spreading in the Tasman Basin ceased a t ${\sim}52{-}50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Gaina et al., 1998), strong evidence exists for Pacificwide synchronicity in major plate reorganization. More generally, the age of the Emperor-Hawaii bend, the inception of Izu-BoninMariana subduction, and a change from extension to compressio n occurred in the Tasman Frontier.  

# Scientific objectives  

Expedition 371 was designed to address the following questions.  

1. How and why does subduction initiation occur? a. Did plate convergence and a period of high horizontal stress with convergent failure precede and induce subduction initiation, or did subduction initiation happen spontaneously with early extensional stresses? b. What vertical stresses occurred during subduction initiation, and when and where was this manifest as uplift or subsidence?   
2. Was the Eocene southwest Pacific anomalously warm, and why? a. What were surface water temperatures during the early Cenozoic across the region, and if anomalous, do they link to local physiographic or oceanographic changes? b. Can early Eocene changes in paleoceanography and carbon cycling as found in the Tasman Frontier be linked to major changes in regional tectonics?   
3. How does post-Eocene oceanography and climate compare with elsewhere in the Pacific? a. When did the modern ocean circulation system develop as evidenced in the Tasman Frontier? b. Are pole-Equator climate teleconnections manifested in the Tasman Sea during the late Cenozoic?  

# Drilling strategy  

Our drill sites were chosen foremost to test geodynamic mode l predictions. Periods of time in the past that had high horizontal stress may be recorded as faulted or folded strata. Anomalous vertical stress in the past, such as stress caused by traction or buoyancy, would have been balanced by surface uplift or subsidence an d should manifest as changes in paleodepths of the seafloor. Furthermore, past changes in thermal or chemical anomalies in the crust o r mantle may be recorded by characteristic volcanic products. W e aimed to collect sedimentary records with these signals.  

The timing and style of faulting and folding can be determine d from stratigraphic relationships tied to seismic reflection data. I n general, three units constrain the timing of a tectonic event: faulte d strata are older than the event, unfaulted strata are younger than th e event, and syntectonic growth strata record progressive faultin g during the event. Growth strata are typically identified from thickness changes in a sedimentary unit that drapes faulted units, an d seismic reflectors in the syntectonic unit may exhibit fanning geometries close to faults.  

The only practical way of measuring elevation of the crus t through time is against a sea level reference frame. Flat unconformities with regional consistency on seismic reflection data often represent  surfaces  produced  by  sea  level–modulated  erosiona l processes. Certain sediment components, particularly fossils of neritic organisms, can provide independent evidence for vertical positions. Samples dredged from $>\!1500\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth in the Reing a Basin during the TAN1312 expedition contain Paleogene bioclasti c limestone with shallow-marine fossils, supporting the hypothesi s that large $(>\!1\,\ensuremath{\mathrm{km}})$ vertical motions were associated with subductio n initiation (Browne et al., 2016). We aimed to recover shallow-wate r $\left(<\!400\,\textrm{m}\!\right)$ fossils, either in place or reworked by sediment gravit y flows, at several locations to provide direct evidence of past vertica l positions at precisely dated times. Importantly, sediment record s targeted for tectonic research objectives align with paleoceanographic goals. Analyses of microfossil assemblages and sedimen t geochemistry can be used to reconstruct a variety of past ocea n conditions, such as water temperature.  

Our strategy was to obtain information on transects parallel an d perpendicular to where subduction initiated to constrain the different physical processes involved in subduction zone initiation (Figure F9). The proximal ridge includes New Caledonia, Norfol k Ridge, Reinga Basin, and northwest New Zealand (Figures F2, F3, F4). Sediment and rocks in this region are deformed, presumabl y during the initial phase of surface convergence (Sutherland et al., 2017). Knowledge from New Caledonia, Sites U1507 and U1508, and New Zealand produce a proximal boundary–parallel transec t that progressively samples initial rates of predicted convergenc e (Bache et al., 2012).  

Sites U1506 and U1507, combined with knowledge from Ne w Caledonia and regional seismic reflection interpretation, shoul d provide a boundary-perpendicular transect in the northern regio n

(Figure F3), where Eocene convergence rates are thought to hav e been highest (Figure F8). Sites U1508–U1511, combined wit h knowledge from New Zealand and Australia, provide a souther n transect (Figure F4) that has clear signs of an extended period o f plate failure (Sutherland et al., 2017).  

We aimed to test the hypothesis that the proximal basin, th e New Caledonia Trough, subsided $>\!2\,\mathrm{km}$ during the Paleogene, eve n though it was only subjected to minor convergent deformatio n (Sutherland et al., 2010). Sites U1507 and U1509 were chosen t o constrain the magnitude and timing of subsidence in relation t o other events. In addition, the New Caledonia Trough contains a record of detrital products derived from ridges on either side and s o records the timing of deformation and emergence of those ridge s (Etienne et al., 2018; Bache et al., 2014a).  

The distal ridge, Lord Howe Rise, shows signs of minor Eocen e convergent deformation, volcanism, and significant erosion surfaces (Sutherland et al., 2010). Sites U1506 and U1510 were chose n to determine the timing and magnitude of vertical motions an d hence constrain the history of dynamic topography (upper mantl e flow), lithospheric buoyancy, and/or tractions related to shea r zones. Different geodynamic model classes make very different predictions of vertical motion.  

The distal basin, the Tasman Abyssal Plain, shows signs of loca l convergent deformation (Sutherland et al., 2017). The force transmitted through the tectonic plate must have been large enough t o stop seafloor spreading and cause failure of the lithosphere. Sit e U1511 was chosen to determine the timing of this change in stres s state and how it relates to other tectonic events. The timing an d magnitude of force transmitted through a plate is a powerful discriminator: an induced subduction model predicts a larger and earlier compressive force than a spontaneous subduction model (Gurnis et al., 2004).  

The Australia-Pacific convergence rate during the time of interest was much faster near New Caledonia than near New Zealan d (Figure F8). Geodynamic models predict that stresses in an initiating subduction system evolve in response to the total convergenc e experienced (Gurnis et al., 2004), so models predict along-strik e changes in timing that can be tested using biostratigraphy. The absolute timing of observables can also be compared with known plat e motions. This ability to track total convergence precisely throug h space and time is special to the Tonga-Kermadec system. Most subduction systems have imprecisely known kinematic histories because the rock record has been subducted.  

# Site summaries  

# Site U1506 (northern Lord Howe Rise) Background and objectives  

Site U1506 (proposed Site LHRN-3A) is located on the norther n Lord Howe Rise, ${\sim}290~\mathrm{km}$ south of DSDP Sites 208 and 588 an d where geophysical surveys image a regional unconformity (Sutherland et al., 2016). At Sites 208 and 588, the unconformity corresponds to a break between foraminiferal and nannofossil chalk o f early Oligocene age and siliceous microfossil–bearing chalk, radiolarite, and diatomite of middle Eocene age. The primary scientifi c objective at Site U1506 was to test the hypothesis that the norther n Lord Howe Rise uplifted to near sea level during the Paleogene an d has subsided since by ${\sim}1500\mathrm{~m~}$ . The drilling target, identified fro m seismic reflection data, is a buried flat-topped feature with ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ of relief above the regional unconformity surface. The feature has  a positive polarity seismic reflection at its top but also has internal reflections. We hypothesized that it could be a coral reef or wave-cu t surface formed during the Eocene. Rotary drilling was chosen because consideration of the seismic reflection amplitude and seismi c refraction velocity $(3.2{-}3.8\ \mathrm{km/s})$ ) suggested the buried structur e might be too hard for advanced piston corer (APC) or extende d core barrel (XCB) coring.  

# Operations  

Hole U1506A: 28°39.7180′S, $161^{\circ}44.4240^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$ ; water depth $=1495\,\mathrm{m}$  

Site U1506 was the first site occupied during Expedition 371. After an $1167~\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Townsville, Australia, the ship arrived at Site U1506 at $1912~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 August 2017 $(\mathrm{UTC}+10\;\mathrm{h})$ ). A t $1948\mathrm{~h~}$ , the drill floor was cleared for operations, beginning Hol e U1506A.  

The rotary core barrel (RCB) bottom-hole assembly (BHA) wa s assembled and deployed, and Hole U1506A was spudded at $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 August. Coring proceeded through Core 29R, where the expected hard formation was encountered at ${\sim}265\ \mathrm{m}$ drilling dept h below seafloor (DSF). We recovered cores in half intervals (4.5–5. 0 m length) below this depth to minimize the risk of core loss due t o jams in the bit or inner barrel.  

Coring stopped after Core 36R, which arrived on the rig floor a t $1345\mathrm{~h~}$ on 5 August. Total recovery for the $306.1\textrm{m}$ DSF cored i n Hole U1506A was $192.38\mathrm{~m~}(63\%)$ and included an average core recovery of $61\%$ from Cores 1R through 28R and $79\%$ from Cores 29 R through 36R, which were recovered in half intervals $(4.5{-}5.0\ \mathrm{m})$ . Hole U1506A operations ended at $1935\;\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{i}}$ and the total time spen t on Hole U1506A (and Site U1506) was $47.75\,\mathrm{h}$ or 2.0 days. At 200 0 $^{\mathrm{h,}}$ we departed for Site U1507.  

# Principal results  

Site U1506 consists of ${\sim}265\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of Pleistocene–middle Eocen e nannofossil ooze and chalk (lithostratigraphic Unit I) overlying ${\sim}40$ m of volcanic rocks (lithostratigraphic Unit II; Figures F10, F11). Unit I sediments are further divided into three subunits.  

Subunit Ia $\left(0{-}258.2\;\mathrm{~m}\right)$ consists of relatively homogeneou s Pleistocene to upper Miocene white nannofossil ooze and chal k with foraminifers, with carbonate content ranging from $88\%$ to $95\%$ . Faint decimeter-scale white and grayish white color banding an d rare blebs of pyrite (generally framboidal under the scanning electron microscope [SEM]) occur in this subunit. The ooze–chal k transition occurs across an interval that includes Cores 371- U1506A-24R through 26R $\left\langle{\sim}260\;\mathrm{m}\right\rangle$ . Fine structures and texture, including bioturbation with slightly darker Zoophycos, Planolites, Skolithos, and Chondrites burrows, are better preserved and visible i n the chalk than in the ooze.  

Subunit Ib $(258.2–264.3\;\mathrm{m})$ is a $\sim\!6\;\mathrm{m}$ thick interval of pale yellow to white upper Oligocene nannofossil chalk with foraminifers. The Subunit $\mathrm{Ia/Ib}$ boundary is marked by a color change from whit e gray to pale yellow and a slight increase in magnetic susceptibilit y (MS). It also represents a ${\sim}10$ My hiatus separating the late Oligocene from the late Miocene. Additionally, Subunit Ib is moderatel y bioturbated with common Zoophycos and Planolites trace fossils.  

Subunit Ic $(264.3–264.6\mathrm{~m})$ is a $34~\mathrm{cm}$ thick interval of middl e Eocene glauconitic nannofossil chalk with foraminifers. The Subunit $\scriptstyle\mathrm{Ib}/\mathrm{Ic}$ boundary, defined by the appearance of glauconite and  a coincident color change to light greenish gray, represents a $\mathord{\sim}20$ M y hiatus between the middle Eocene and late Oligocene. Subunit Ic i s intensely bioturbated, with burrows filled with pale yellow Oligocene nannofossil chalk from the overlying Subunit Ib.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit II $(264.6{-}305.3\ \mathrm{m})$ ) represents the uppermost ${\sim}41\mathrm{~m~}$ of a volcanic rock sequence. It consists of microcrystalline to fine-grained basalt with facies alternating in ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{~m~}$ couplets of (1) dark reddish brown microcrystalline, highly vesicular, and amygdaloidal basalt with common veins and (2) dark gra y fine-grained massive aphyric basalt with rare carbonate veins. Thi n sections and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements show the basal t is dominated by Ca-plagioclase and clinopyroxene alongside various alteration minerals such as Fe-Ti oxides and chlorite. The carbonate veins and vesicle fills display a variety of composition an d texture, including large $_{>1\,\,\mathrm{cm}}$ grain size) fibrous calcite crystal s and fine-grained bioclastic packstone.  

Nannofossil and planktic foraminifer biostratigraphy assign  a Pleistocene to late Oligocene age to lithostratigraphic Subunits I a and Ib. Higher resolution sampling identified a condensed interval between Samples 371-U1506A-28R-3, $75\ \mathrm{cm}_{}$ , and 28R-4, $75\ \mathrm{cm}$ $257.25{-}258.75\;\mathrm{m})$ , that represents ${\sim}10\,\,\mathrm{My}$ . Subunit Ic is of middl e Eocene age. A sample of a burrow fill in Subunit Ic (Sample 29R-2, $70\,\mathrm{cm}$ ; $264.36\;\mathrm{m})$ ) is late Oligocene in age, indicating erosion or nondeposition of middle Eocene to upper Oligocene sediment.  

Microfossil assemblages consist of well-preserved calcareou s nannofossils, planktic and benthic foraminifers, and ostracods, indicating a depositional depth well above the lysocline. The middl e Eocene benthic foraminifers are characteristic of an upper bathyal environment, about $500{-}1000\;\mathrm{m}$ shallower than the late Oligocen e and younger intervals. The ostracod assemblages indicate a deepwater setting throughout Subunits Ia and Ib (representing late Oligocene and younger age) but an upper bathyal setting for Subunit I c (middle Eocene).  

Rare, heavily recrystallized reworked radiolarians were found i n some core catcher samples from this site. No other siliceous microfossils were found in samples examined from this site.  

A palynological reconnaissance study carried out on five samples from Hole U1506A, including one sample from the middle Eocene  glauconite-rich  layer  in  Section  29R-2,  yielded  n o palynomorphs.  

Paleomagnetic measurements from ooze samples, representin g most of lithostratigraphic Subunit Ia, yielded unstable paleomagnetic directions, largely due to reworking of sediments (bioturbation) and drilling disturbance associated with the RCB corin g system. Integration with discrete sample–derived directions doe s not allow reliable correlation with the geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS). However, stable paleomagnetic directions with several polarity reversals were obtained in the chalk interval (belo w ${\sim}245\;\mathrm{m})$ ), and clarity was improved by alternating field (AF) demagnetization at $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ . Principal component analysis of paleomagneti c directions after stepwise AF demagnetization of discrete sample s reveals a stable remanent magnetization component above 10–2 0 mT, confirming observations from superconducting rock magnetometer measurements.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit II yields a stable paleomagnetic signa l after removing the overprint with AF demagnetization at $20\;\mathrm{mT}.$ .  A normal polarity was obtained from most volcanic rock samples. Some intervals not affected by AF demagnetization showed a reversed polarity after $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization. Further analyses (e.g., thermal demagnetization) are required to investigate the paleomagnetic signal of the volcanic materials.  

Gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density, MS, color, and natural gamma radiation (NGR) exhibit small amplitude variations i n lithostratigraphic Unit I and significantly greater amplitude variations in Unit II.

Figure F10. Lithostratigraphic comparison of sites cored during Expedition 371. Arrows $=$ approximate location of ooze–chalk transition.  

In Unit I, GRA bulk density varies between 1.6 and $1.8~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3};$ and porosity decreases from $\mathord{\sim}63\%$ to $52\%$ from the seafloor to th e base of Unit I, typical of calcareous ooze and chalk. $P$ -wave velocit y increases gradually with depth from $\mathord{\sim}1600$ to ${\sim}2000\ \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . Intermittently higher $P.$ -wave velocity values of ${\sim}2200~\mathrm{m/s}$ in Cores 371- U1506A-26R and 27R reflect the diagenetic transition of ooze t o chalk. MS is low throughout the sedimentary section, with a few local MS spikes as high as 100 instrument units (IU). NGR is also generally  low  (1–4  counts/s)  but  increases  to ${\sim}25$ counts/s  i n glauconitic Subunit Ic.  

Thermal conductivity shows a gradual and increasing trend wit h depth from 1.1 to $1.4\:\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K})$ over the uppermost ${\sim}250\;\mathrm{m}$ , consistent with expected values for calcareous ooze and chalk. Vane shea r strength increases from ${\sim}18\,\mathrm{kPa}$ near the seafloor to ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{kPa}$ at 19 0 m. Compressive strength from penetrometer measurements show s very low strength in the top ${\sim}72\,\mathrm{m}$ of Unit I and then increases an d becomes variable $\mathord{\sim}60$ to ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{kPa}_{.}$ ) to $186\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

The most significant change in physical properties spans th e lithostratigraphic Unit I/II boundary. This sediment/rock contact a t $265\;\mathrm{m}$ corresponds to major increases in bulk density (as high as 2. 8

$\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3})$ and $P$ -wave velocity $(4400{-}6500\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ . This impedance contrast can be correlated with the major reflection seen in the multichannel seismic (MCS) profiles used in the site surveys (2.29 s twoway traveltime [TWT]). MS (0–1500 IU), NGR (\~3–9 counts/s) , bulk density, and color reflectance show much higher amplitud e variations in Unit II than in Unit I. Porosity drops to $9\%{-}20\%$ i n Unit II.  

A total of 15 interstitial water (IW) samples were collected fro m Cores 371-U1506A-4R through 28R $:26{-}261\ \mathrm{m};$ lithostratigraphi c Unit I). Sulfate concentration decreases from ${\sim}29\;\mathrm{mM}$ at the “mudline” to ${\sim}20~\mathrm{mM}$ at depth. The ammonium profile somewhat mirrors that of sulfate, increasing from 0 to $150~\upmu\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , which suggest s sulfate reduction of particulate organic carbon in the sediments. The product of this reaction, $\mathrm{H}_{2}S,$ , once reacting with Fe, also explains the abundant iron sulfide mineral horizons observed in th e cores. From the top to the bottom of the sedimentary section, C a increases from 10.6 to $18.3\;\mathrm{mM}$ and $\mathrm{Mg}$ decreases from 52.9 to 36. 2 $\mathrm{mM}$ , which could reflect reactions between pore water and basement rock. Si and Mn increase from 160 to $200\;\mathrm{mM}$ and from 0.4 t o $3\,\mathrm{mM}_{\sun}$ , respectively, at the transition from ooze to chalk.  

Headspace gas samples were collected from each core. Hydrocarbon gas concentrations in all samples were below detection limits.  

Carbonate $\tt(C a C O_{3})$ content is high $(>\!88\ensuremath{~\mathrm{W}^{\mathrm{I}}\!\%})$ throughout Unit  I and increases with depth in the uppermost $70\,\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , with the highest values $(\sim\!95\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ between 85 and $143~\mathrm{m}$ and between 200 and $228~\mathrm{m}$ . Total organic carbon (TOC) percentages are low, with values rangin g between 0.2 and $0.4\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ in the top ${\sim}210\;\mathrm{m}$ and between 0.6 and 1. 0 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ from 219 to $247\,\mathrm{m}$ . Trace amounts of nitrogen are present in th e uppermost two samples (0.65 and $14.32\;\mathrm{m}\mathrm{}^{\mathrm{~\,~}}$ ). No samples were take n for bulk sediment geochemistry from Subunit Ic or Unit II.  

# Site U1507 (northern New Caledonia Trough) Background and objectives  

Site U1507 (proposed Site NCTN-8A) is located in the Ne w Caledonia Trough, ${\sim}460~\mathrm{km}$ south of New Caledonia, ${\sim}620\ \mathrm{km}$ north of DSDP Site 206, and ${\sim}530~\mathrm{km}$ east of Sites 208 and 588. Trending northwest–southeast and north–south, the New Caledonia Trough delineates a ${\sim}1700~\mathrm{km}$ long bathymetric low on northern Zealandia (Figure F2). The northern and central parts of th e feature were not drilled prior to Expedition 371. On the basis of evidence from Site 206 and the Taranaki Basin, it was inferred that th e New Caledonia Trough formed during Cretaceous rifting and subsequent subsidence. However, recent analysis of high-quality seismic reflection data led to an alternate hypothesis: the presen t physiography was created mainly during Eocene subduction zon e initiation. Site U1507 was chosen to determine the timing of deformation and uplift of Norfolk Ridge, constrain the age of trough formation and sedimentary fill, and obtain a record of regional volcanism (Sutherland et al., 2016). The intent was to core Sit e U1507 using the APC/XCB system to sample a downlapping sequence (at ${\sim}500{-}700$ meters below seafloor [mbsf]) that was inferred to represent an influx of sediment from the Norfolk Ridg e and hence date emergence of the ridge.  

# Operations  

Hole U1507A: 26°29.3158′S, $166^{\circ}31.7039^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; water depth $=3568\,\mathrm{m}$ Hole U1507B: 26°29.3158′S, 166°31.7155′E; water depth $=3568\;\mathrm{m}$  

Hole U1507A was cored with the APC and XCB systems. Th e first was used to retrieve Cores 1H through 26H with an average recovery of $106\%$ . Temperature measurements were taken at the bottom of Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, 13H, 16H, and 19H. Deployment o f orientation and temperature tools was discontinued after Core 20H, and APC coring was discontinued after Core 26H. Coring continued with the XCB system, retrieving Cores 27X through 46X wit h an average recovery of $55\%$ . Total recovery for Hole U1507A wa s $352.7\mathrm{~m~}(83\%)$ , and the total time spent on Hole U1507A was 3. 6 days.  

Hole U1507B was first drilled without coring from 0 to $376\textrm{m}$ DSF and then cored (Cores 2R through 53R) with a recovery o f $371.5\;\mathrm{m}\;(76\%)$ . The total time spent on Hole U1507B was 8.1 days.  

After dropping the coring bit at the bottom of the hole and replacing the hole with heavy mud, three logging passes were mad e with a modified triple combo tool string between 75.2 and $864~\mathrm{m}$ wireline log depth below seafloor (WSF): a downhole log, a $125\mathrm{~m~}$ uphole log for calibration, and a main log up the entire hole. Th e modified triple combo logging tool string included MS, electrical resistivity, sonic, bulk density, and NGR tools.  

# Principal results  

The sedimentary sequence at Site U1507 consists of ${\sim}685\mathrm{~m~}$ o f biogenic ooze and chalk interbedded with calcareous and volcaniclastic turbidites (lithostratigraphic Unit I) overlying ${\sim}170\,\mathrm{~m~}$ o f more homogeneous clayey nannofossil chalk (lithostratigraphi c Unit II; Figures F10, F11). Unit I sediments are further divided int o three subunits based on changes in lithology and sedimentological features as identified by macroscopic and microscopic (smear slide, thin section, and SEM) core description.  

Subunit Ia $(0{-}401.2\,\textrm{m})$ mostly consists of white nannofossi l ooze and chalk. This dominant lithology is accompanied by ligh t greenish gray nannofossil-rich clay with volcanic ash, white gra y normally graded foraminiferal ooze or limestone beds, and a restricted ${\sim}2\,\textrm{m}$ thick interval of very dark greenish gray volcani c breccia and tuffaceous sandstone. Soft-sediment deformation i s widespread but particularly common in the lowermost part of th e subunit.  

Subunit Ib $(401.2–542.9\mathrm{~m})$ ) is primarily composed of greenis h gray clayey nannofossil chalk with volcanic ash that shows significant soft-sediment deformation and is interbedded with dark gra y clayey tuffaceous sandstone and greenish gray clayey foraminifera l limestone with volcanic clasts. This subunit differs from Subunit I a because of an overall increase in clay and volcanic content.  

Subunit Ic $(542.9\mathrm{-}685.5\;\mathrm{~m)}$ consists of dark greenish gra y coarse- to fine-grained tuffaceous conglomerate, sandstone, an d tuff alternating with light greenish gray clayey nannofossil chal k with volcanic ash. The boundary with Subunit Ib is defined by th e first occurrence of a thick-bedded tuffaceous conglomerate. Volcaniclastic lithologies display a range of sedimentary facies that poin t to deposition from various gravity flow processes from debris flow s to turbidity currents. Thin sections and XRD measurements on th e volcaniclastics reveal that clast lithologies consist of variable percentages of basaltic minerals such as pyroxene, plagioclase, and olivine phenocrysts, as well as volcanic glass shards, vesicular pumice, and large benthic foraminifers.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit II $(685.5{-}855.7\;\mathrm{m})$ consists of homogeneous light greenish gray bioturbated clayey nannofossil chalk wit h common Zoophycos, Nereites, and Spirophyton burrows and rar e foraminiferal limestone beds. The lithology is consistent with hemipelagic-dominated sedimentation. Very rare foraminiferal limestone beds with few volcanic grains are still encountered in thi s subunit. Between 826 and $836\;\mathrm{m}$ , the lithology changes to a greenish gray nannofossil claystone, possibly reflecting increased carbonate dissolution.  

Nannofossils and foraminifers are present throughout Hole s U1507A and U1507B, providing a robust stratigraphy (Figure F11) : Pliocene–Pleistocene $(6.2{-}177.8\;\mathrm{m})$ ), Miocene $(187.0\mathrm{-}432.6\;\mathrm{m})$ , lat e Oligocene $(449.9\substack{-520.0~\mathrm{m}})$ , early Oligocene ( $523.1\mathrm{-}639.1\ \mathrm{m})$ , an d late to middle Eocene $(642.3{-}855.7\ \mathrm{m})$ . The Oligocene/Miocen e boundary was approximated using the top of Sphenolithus delphix $({\sim}442.5\,\mathrm{m})$ . The Eocene/Oligocene boundary was approximated using the top of planktic foraminifer Globigerina euapertura, the benthic foraminifer Nuttallides truempyi, the base acme of calcareou s nannofossil Clausicoccus subdistichus, and the top of rosette discoasters.  

The occurrence of Orbulinoides beckmanni in samples fro m 835.5 to $836.1\ \mathrm{m}$ constrains these depths to planktic foraminifera l Zone E12 $\!(40.03\!-\!40.43\,\mathrm{Ma})$ , which effectively marks the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO). For calcareous nannofossils, th e base of Dictyococcites bisectus at ${\sim}836.1\mathrm{~m~}$ and the top of Sphenolithus obtusus at ${\sim}825.6\:\mathrm{m}$ indicate the post-MECO interval was recovered in this interval. However, Core 371-U1507B-51R (835.7– $836.1\ \mathrm{m})$ only recovered $38\ \mathrm{cm}\ (4\%)$ , so most of the MECO wa s washed away or lost during coring.  

Radiolarians have a patchy record. Well-preserved Neogen e radiolarians are found in samples from 6.2 to $54.1~\mathrm{m}$ . The interva l from 63.4 to $380.6\mathrm{~m~}$ is barren of radiolarians. The interval fro m 380.6 to $523.2\;\mathrm{m}$ contains varying amounts of radiolarians, rangin g from trace to common, with some samples barren of radiolarians. Low-latitude index species are absent or rare.  

Benthic foraminifers indicate paleodepths that gradually rang e from abyssal in the most recent part of the sequence to lowe r bathyal in the Oligocene and Eocene. In some intervals (e.g., ${\sim}205.6$ m), their assemblages contain a mixture of deep-water and relativel y shallow-water taxa with different preservation states. A palynological reconnaissance study carried out on 10 core catcher samples throughout the sedimentary sequence showed that deposits a t Site U1507 are effectively barren of palynomorphs. Ostracods are rare to common between 6.2 and $279.7\;\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1507A and absent in Hole U1507B, except for one sample.  

The quality of paleomagnetic measurements on section halve s from Holes U1507A and U1507B varies for different lithostratigraphic units. In Hole U1507A, the natural remanent magnetizatio n (NRM) intensity is in the range of $10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ and increases from 23 4 m downhole by about one order of magnitude. NRM inclination i s mostly positive, likely the effect of a present-day geomagnetic overprint. After AF demagnetization cleaning at $20\,\mathrm{\mT}$ , the interval from 0 to $54.1\mathrm{~m~}$ is characterized by dominantly normal polarit y with some intervals of reversed polarity. Between 53.7 and $215.6\;\mathrm{m}$ , some swings between positive and negative inclination without  a clear bimodal clustering were observed, and from $216~\mathrm{m}$ downhol e inclinations are less stable. This instability may reflect some combination of drilling-related deformation, depositional processes, an d weak magnetization. The average inclination for Hole U1507A i s around $-20^{\circ}$ , and no reliable shipboard magnetostratigraphy could be obtained for this hole.  

High-quality paleomagnetic data were obtained on sediment s from Hole U1507B, including a well-defined series of normal an d reversed polarity intervals in lithostratigraphic Unit I. Inclinatio n values for Unit I after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization are clustered i n two clear peaks around $-40^{\circ}$ and $45^{\circ}$ . The overall high-qualit y paleomagnetic data from Hole U1507B can be attributed to the hig h NRM intensity and good recovery of lithified sediment cores. Integration with biostratigraphic results shows that the interval between 433.3 and $682.9\:\mathrm{m}$ contains most polarity chrons from Chro n C6Br in the early Miocene through Chron C16n in the late Eocene.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit II sediments generally show scattere d inclination values without recognizable bimodal distribution. Tw o inclination changes at 759.3 and $834.0\ \mathrm{m}$ are tentatively correlate d with the bases of Chrons $C17\mathrm{n}$ and $C18\mathfrak{n}_{\mathfrak{\tau}}$ , respectively.  

Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) was measured o n 123 discrete samples from Site U1507, which were collected in th e most undisturbed intervals and often on top of turbidite layers. Th e soft and magnetically weak sediments from Hole U1507A did no t yield well-defined orientations of the AMS tensor. Cube sample s from lithified sediment, however, show a clear oblate magnetic fabric in which the minimum axis of the AMS ellipsoid is statisticall y oriented perpendicular to the bedding.  

Cores recovered from Holes U1507A and U1507B were analyzed with the full suite of physical properties measurements. Downhole temperature measurements were made in Hole U1507A, and wireline logging was completed using a modified triple comb o tool string in Hole U1507B.  

Bulk density increases with depth from the seafloor $(1.5\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ to the bottom of the hole $(2.4\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ with local decreases to ${\sim}1.6$ $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ observed between ${\sim}420$ and ${\sim}500\;\mathrm{m}$ . Moisture and density– derived porosity values correspondingly decrease from $\sim\!70\%$ i n nannofossil ooze at the top of Hole U1507A to ${\sim}25\%$ in nannofossil chalk at the base of Hole U1507B. Grain density is ${\sim}2.71~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ t o ${\sim}300\mathrm{~m~}$ and then varies between 2.7 and $2.8~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to ${\sim}700~\mathrm{m},$ except for the interval from ${\sim}420$ to $500~\mathrm{m}$ , where grain density conspicuously drops to $2.6{-}2.7~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . In lithostratigraphic Unit II, grain density decreases again to ${\sim}2.5{-}2.7~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

$P$ -wave velocity measured on cores gradually increases downhole in Subunit Ia, with a more rapid increase around $290\;\mathrm{m}$ corresponding to the diagenesis of ooze to chalk. From ${\sim}400$ to $520\;\mathrm{m},P$ - wave velocity increases from 2000 to $2500~\mathrm{m/s}$ and then stays a t similar values to the base of the hole. $P$ -wave velocity from wirelin e logging increases from 2300 to $2700\ \mathrm{m/s}$ in Unit II, with a negativ e excursion to ${\sim}2400\ \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ associated with the MECO at ${\sim}835\mathrm{~m~}$ .  

Thermal conductivity increases gradually with depth from 1.1 t o 1.8 W/(m·K) in Subunit Ia and decreases in Subunits Ib and Ic. I n Hole U1507A, six temperature measurements were made with th e advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3), yielding a temperature gradient of $46.9^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ .  

MS is low $\mathrm{<}50\,\mathrm{IU)}$ in Subunits Ia and Ib and as high as 1000 I U in Subunit Ic. Below $680\;\mathrm{m}$ , values decrease to ${\sim}40$ IU and are constant in the lowermost part of the hole. NGR measured on cores an d by wireline logging show matching downhole variations. NGR i s low, except for positive excursions of ${\sim}20{-}40\$ counts/s between 40 0 and $520\;\mathrm{m}$ and between 520 and $680\,\mathrm{m}$ .  

Changes in color reflectance occur at the base of Subunit Ia, where all parameters decrease, reflecting the darker and greene r clay-rich sediments. A slight increase in lightness $\left(\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\right)$ was observe d at the top of Unit II.  

Headspace gas samples were routinely collected from each cor e from Holes U1507A and U1507B. Hydrocarbon gas concentration s in all samples were below detection limits.  

A total of 56 IW samples were collected from Cores 371- U1507A-1H  through  45X  (51  samples)  and  371-U1507B-6 R through 14R (5 samples). The results show a distinctive differenc e between above and below $250\,\mathrm{m}$ , corresponding to the change fro m APC to XCB or rotary coring. The IW constituent profiles ar e smooth in the upper $250\,\mathrm{m}$ and become scattered below $250\,\mathrm{m}$ . Despite this issue, Mg, K, and $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ generally decrease downhole, whereas Ca increases downhole. Dissolved Sr increases smoothly i n the upper $160\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and then remains approximately constant wit h depth. The negative correlation between dissolved Ca and Mg concentrations suggests reactions between volcanic material and por e water in the sediment column. The downhole decrease in $\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ suggests sulfate reduction of particulate organic carbon, which also explains the rise in dissolved $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ with depth.  

Samples for solid sediment analysis were taken at a samplin g resolution of at least one sample per core from Holes U1507A an d U1507B. Carbonate content is very high $(>\!90\,\mathrm{wt\%})$ ) throughout Subunit Ia. Decreasing carbonate content $(30{-}70\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ toward the middle of Subunit Ib and Ic correlates well with changes in othe r properties, such as decreasing reflectance $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ , increasing MS, an d increasing NGR. Interbedded darker colored layers are represente d by lower total carbon and carbonate contents $(\sim\!20\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ ). Carbonat e content in Unit II is high, varying between 50 and $80~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . TO C content is low (averaging $0.4\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) throughout the sediment colum n and does not differ significantly between units.  

Linear sedimentation rates (LSRs) and mass accumulation rate s (MARs) were calculated for Site U1507 using paleomagnetic an d calcareous nannofossil datums (Figure F11). The record recovere d at Site U1507 is remarkably continuous despite numerous turbidit e deposits and seismic reflectors, and it includes the entirety of th e Oligocene. LSRs in the mid- to late Eocene vary between ${\sim}30$ and 6 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{M}\mathbf{y}$ but decrease near the Eocene–Oligocene transition to $\mathord{\sim}15-$ $20\,\mathrm{m/My}$ . An extended duration of low LSRs $({\sim}12\;\mathrm{m/My})$ ) characterizes the Oligocene to middle Miocene, except for two short time intervals of enhanced LSRs (30–29 and $25{-}23\,\mathrm{\Ma})$ ). After $9.5\,\mathrm{\:Ma}$ , LSRs stepwise increase to $40~\mathrm{m/My}$ at $7.4\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and remain at thes e high values until $4.0\,M{\bf a}$ . This pulse in sedimentation, which is characterized by constant high carbonate contents, may correspond t o the late Miocene to early Pliocene biogenic bloom as documented a t other sites. The uppermost 4 My at Site U1507 are represented by  a relatively condensed section with LSRs ${<}4\;\mathrm{m}$ /My.  

Sediment MARs follow the trend observed in LSRs and vary between 2 and $12\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\mathrm{ky}$ .  

# Site U1508 (Reinga Basin)  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1508 (proposed Site REIS-2A) is located ${\sim}130\,\mathrm{km}$ west o f Cape Reinga, the northern tip of Northland, New Zealand. The location is on the northeast margin of Reinga Basin (Bache et al., 2012), which contains folded Eocene strata that have been dredge d but never drilled (Browne et al., 2016). The site was chosen to sample a record of deformation, uplift, subsidence, and early arc volcanism in a southern region proximal to Tonga-Kermadec subductio n initiation (Sutherland et al., 2016). The overall objective was to sample Miocene–Eocene strata that includes an onlap surface tha t marks the onset of deformation. A high-amplitude seismic reflecto r near the base of the borehole has regional significance for stratigraphic correlation and was hypothesized to represent a majo r change in sedimentation during the Eocene.

We completed the $546\,\mathrm{\nmi}$ transit from Site U1507 to Sit e U1508 and arrived at $2300~\mathrm{h}$ on 20 August 2017 $(\mathrm{UTC}+10\,\mathrm{h})$ ). A n APC/XCB BHA was made up, and APC coring in Hole U1508 A started at $0900~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 August. Temperature measurements wer e taken on Cores 7H, 9H, 10H, 12H, 14H, and 17H. Core 23H had t o be drilled over for $40\;\mathrm{min}$ to release it from the formation, and Hol e U1508A was ended at $1140~\mathrm{h}$ on 22 August. Total recovery for th e $210.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF cored was $201.1\mathrm{~m~}(96\%)$ . The time spent on Hol e U1508A was $36.0\,\mathrm{h}$ or 1.5 days.  

The ship was offset ${\sim}20\mathrm{~m~}$ to the southwest. An RCB BHA wa s made up, and drilling without coring in Hole U1508B started a t $1745\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 August, reaching the target $186.6\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{DSF})$ ) at $2245\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 22 August. Coring in Hole U1508B began with Core 2R. While retrieving Core 38R $\mathrm{^503.4\,\m}$ DSF) at $0700\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 24 August, w e stopped operations because of a medical emergency and began recovering the drill string. Cores 2R through 38R penetrated fro m 186.6 to $503.4\:\mathrm{m}$ DSF and recovered $133.32\,\mathrm{m}$ $(42\%)$ . The time spen t on Hole U1508B was $49.5\,\mathrm{h}$ or 2.1 days.  

The $302\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Auckland began at $1354\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 August . During the trip, the clock was advanced twice (to $\mathrm{UTC}\,+\,12\,\mathrm{\h};$ Auckland time). On the way back from the medical evacuation, th e clock was set back $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ to $\mathrm{UTC}+11\,\mathrm{h}$ and remained that way for th e rest of the Expedition 371 drilling operations. The trip back to Sit e U1508 was completed at $0600~\mathrm{h}$ on 27 August. An RCB BHA wa s deployed, and Hole U1508C was initiated ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{m}$ northwest of Hol e U1508B at $1150~\mathrm{h}$ . The uppermost $450\,\textrm{m}$ of Hole U1508C wa s drilled without coring, except for two spot-cored intervals at $278.0-$ $292.6\:\mathrm{m}$ DSF (Cores 2R through 4R) and $316.0–330.7\;\mathrm{m}\;.$ DSF (Core s 6R and 7R) to better recover key intervals. At $0730\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 August, we resumed RCB coring until penetration rates slowed to ${\sim}2~\mathrm{m/h}$ . Although short of the desired target depth, we decided to stop coring and conduct wireline logging at $0300~\mathrm{h}$ on 31 August. Collectively,  Cores  2R  through  38R  and  the  two  drilled  interval s penetrated from 278.0 to $704.5\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF and recovered $185.04\mathrm{~m~}$ o f sediment $65\%$ of cored intervals).  

The bit was dropped at the bottom of the hole at $0325\ \mathrm{h}$ on 3 1 August, the hole was displaced with 194 bbl of $11.0\;\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{gal}$ mud, an d the open end of the drill string was set at $86.7~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. At $0900\;\mathrm{h}_{!}$ , w e deployed the same modified triple combo logging tool string configuration as the one used in Hole U1507B, but no source was installe d in the density tool. Logging went well until ${\sim}1230\ \mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , when the too l string became stuck at ${\sim}270\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF. The logging line was cut at th e rig floor and terminated with connectors that would allow assembl y of drill pipe over the logging line to wash down and over the loggin g tools with the open-ended BHA. After the logging tools were free a t $2105~\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , the tool string arrived back on the rig floor at $0315~\mathrm{h}$ on  1 September. After the drill string was recovered, the ship began th e transit to Site U1509 at $0730\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 September.  

# Principal results  

The sedimentary sequence at Site U1508 consists of ${\sim}700\mathrm{~m~}$ o f heterogeneous strata divided into three lithostratigraphic units (I, II, and III).  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I $(0.0–90.1\;\mathrm{m})$ consists of ${\sim}90\,\mathrm{m}$ of foraminiferal ooze with varying amounts of nannofossils and coarsegrained bioclasts. An increase in the occurrence of millimeter-size d bioclasts composed mainly of bryozoans starts at ${\sim}49\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and extends to the bottom of the unit. The Unit I/II boundary at $90.1\;\mathrm{m}$ i s defined by an abrupt change from foraminiferal ooze with bioclast s to clayey nannofossil ooze with biosilica.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit II $(90.1{-}379.3\;\mathrm{m})$ consists of ${\sim}290~\mathrm{m}$ o f calcareous ooze and chalk with varying amounts of clay and is divided into two subunits. Subunit IIa $(90.1{-}200.6\;\mathrm{m})$ ) comprises ligh t greenish clayey nannofossil ooze with varying contents of foraminifers and sponge spicules. Subunit IIb $(200.6–379.3\mathrm{~m})$ is nannofossil-rich foraminiferal ooze and chalk with lithic and volcani c grains increasing to ${\sim}336\mathrm{~m~}$ and then decreasing downhole, resulting in a pure foraminiferal chalk in the lowermost $30\;\mathrm{m}$ of the subunit.  

The lithostratigraphic Unit II/III boundary at $379.3\;\mathrm{m}$ was identified by an abrupt downhole decrease in grain size to nannofossi l chalk with varying amounts of foraminifers. Unit III (379.3–701. 9 m) is composed of moderately bioturbated nannofossil chalk, whic h is further divided into two subunits. Subunit IIIa $(379.3–491.6\mathrm{~m})$ consists of moderately to heavily bioturbated clayey nannofossi l chalk and contains at least 50 sporadic centimeter-scale chert y limestone intervals. Subunit IIIb $(493.8{-}701.9\ \mathrm{m})$ is characterize d by a downhole decrease in clay content and color brightening, wit h cherty limestone last observed at ${\sim}503\mathrm{~m~}$ . Subunit IIIb comprise s nannofossil chalk, and from ${\sim}685\mathrm{~m~}$ downhole it is sufficiently lithified to be classified as nannofossil limestone.  

Calcareous nannofossils are abundant in most of the studie d samples. Planktic foraminifers dominate over benthic foraminifers, which are present in most samples. Radiolarians are few to rare i n most samples, barren in some samples from Holes U1508A an d U1508B, and few to abundant in the lower half of Hole U1508A. Ostracods are abundant to common in Unit I and Subunit IIb and rar e to barren in Subunits IIa, IIIa, and IIIb. Preservation of all fossi l groups decreases downhole, ranging from excellent to good in th e upper part of Hole U1508A and from moderate to poor in Hol e U1508C.  

Calcareous nannofossil and planktic foraminiferal datums, occasionally supplemented by radiolarian biostratigraphy, allow ag e assignments for all studied samples (Figure F11). Lithostratigraphi c Unit I is Pleistocene–Pliocene in age. The interval between 96 an d $210\;\mathrm{m}$ , nearly coincident with lithostratigraphic Subunit IIa, is Miocene in age. Samples between 187 and $373\;\mathrm{m}$ are Miocene to Oligocene in age. Nannofossil biostratigraphy points to an early Miocen e to late Oligocene hiatus (Zones NN4–NN1) of ${\sim}6$ My in both Hole s U1508B $(312{-}321\;\mathrm{m})$ ) and U1508C $(316\mathrm{-}321\;\mathrm{m})$ ). The interval fro m 379 to $497\textrm{m}$ in Hole U1508B is late to middle Eocene in age. I n Hole U1508C, the interval from 450 to $480\;\mathrm{m}$ is late Eocene in ag e and the interval from 484 to $686\;\mathrm{m}$ is middle Eocene in age. Nannofossils, planktic foraminifers, and radiolarians indicate an early Eocene age near the bottom of the sequence $(686\mathrm{-}702\,\mathrm{~m~})$ . Agediagnostic dinocyst species corroborate the age constraints determined by nannofossils and planktic foraminifers.  

Benthic microfossils (ostracods and foraminifers) indicate  a lower bathyal paleoenvironment throughout most of the sedimentary sequence and at slightly shallower paleodepths (deep middl e bathyal) during the Oligocene and late Eocene. Palynological assemblages contain moderately to well-preserved palynomorphs, which are predominantly inner neritic to pelagic dinocysts. Terrestrial palynomorph content is much higher in the Pliocene to lat e Oligocene than in the early Oligocene to Eocene, indicating a significant change in offshore transport. Reworked microfossils, particularly those of early Paleogene age, commonly occur downhole fro m the mid-Miocene in all fossil groups.  

Pass-through paleomagnetic measurements from Unit I (0–9 0 m) are affected by core disturbance and have extremely weak magnetization $({\sim}10^{-5}{-}10^{-3}\,\mathrm{~A/m})$ , resulting in random NRM inclinations. NRM inclinations in Subunit IIa $(\sim\!90{-}210\,\mathrm{m})$ show a series o f polarity swings but no clear polarity pattern. In contrast, high-quality paleomagnetic data were obtained from Subunit IIb from ${\sim}250$ to $380\;\mathrm{m}$ with well-defined geomagnetic reversals. From lithostratigraphic Subunit IIb to Unit III, the NRM intensity drops to ${\sim}10^{-4}-$ $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ , resulting in poor paleomagnetic behavior for many cores. Reliable paleomagnetic data were obtained from some intervals i n Hole U1508C, including 278–324 and $\sim\!650\mathrm{-}700\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Integratio n with biostratigraphy allows a series of paleomagnetic reversals i n Holes U1508B and U1508C (Subunit IIb and Unit III) to be correlated with the GPTS back to ${\sim}48\,M\mathbf{a}$ .  

Samples from Hole U1508A have a poorly defined orientation o f the AMS tensor, whereas most samples from Holes U1508B an d U1508C exhibit a well-defined oblate AMS fabric with the minimum axis of the AMS ellipsoids statistically oriented perpendicula r to the bedding plane.  

Variations in physical properties define three distinctive boundaries at ${\sim}90$ , $\mathord{\sim}200$ , and ${\sim}500~\mathrm{m}$ and are correlated with two stron g reflections in the MCS data and three lithostratigraphic boundaries. The upper interval, corresponding to lithostratigraphic Unit I, i s characterized by low density $({\sim}1.5~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , high porosity $(\sim\!65\%-$ $75\%$ ), and increasing velocity ( $\mathord{\sim}1500$ to ${\sim}1700\,\mathrm{m/s})$ ). All of these values show a baseline shift at the Unit I/II boundary $\left(\sim\!90\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ to highe r bulk density values $({\sim}1.65\mathrm{~g/cm^{3}})$ , lower porosity values $\sim\!60\%-$ $65\%$ ), and lower velocity values $\left.\sim\!1600\mathrm{~m/s}\right)$ that remain constan t throughout Subunit IIa to ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ . In the uppermost part of Subuni t IIb $(\sim\!200\!-\!250\,\textrm{m})$ , bulk density decreases from ${\sim}1.75$ to ${\sim}1.55$ $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , porosity increases from ${\sim}60\%$ to $\sim\!70\%$ , and shear strengt h decreases from ${\sim}100$ to ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{kPa}$ , whereas $P$ -wave velocity increase s from $\mathord{\sim}1600$ to $1900\ \mathrm{m/s}$ . Below the Subunit IIIa/IIIb boundary a t $500\ \mathrm{m},$ bulk density gradually increases from 2.0 to $2.3~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , porosity gradually decreases to $\sim\!25\%$ , and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity increase s from ${\sim}2200$ to $2600\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . At the very base of Subunit IIIb where th e transition from chalk to limestone occurs $(680{-}700\,\mathrm{m})$ ), velocity an d bulk density sharply increase to ${\sim}3600~\mathrm{m/s}$ and $2.45~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively.  

NGR and color reflectance data reveal complementary trends t o the density, porosity, and velocity measurements, including th e three distinctive boundaries at ${\sim}90$ , $\mathord{\sim}200$ , and ${\sim}500\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . NGR increases and the color changes at ${\sim}90\mathrm{~m~}$ . NGR decreases and the n increases around ${\sim}200\mathrm{~m~}$ . MS from wireline logging and core measurements are low throughout the entire section, except for the interval from $\mathord{\sim}240$ to ${\sim}380\,\mathrm{~m~}$ (Subunit IIb), which contains lithi c constituents. This interval also has higher amplitude (as high as $\mathord{\sim}20$ counts/s) NGR variations.  

Five in situ temperature measurements in Hole U1508A revealed a gradient of ${\sim}55^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ .  

Headspace gas samples were routinely collected from each Hol e U1508A core and from deeper Hole U1508C cores. Methane wa s above the detection limit from ${\sim}460\;\mathrm{m}$ downhole and progressivel y increased below ${\sim}500\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . At the base of Hole U1508C, methan e concentration was $\mathord{\sim}6000$ ppmv and ethane concentration was 3 6 ppmv.  

A total of 75 IW samples were collected from Site U1508 b y three different methods: whole-round squeezing, Rhizon sampling, and half-round squeezing. The latter were ${\sim}15~\mathrm{cm}$ intervals take n from core working halves 1–2 days after recovery and crushed i n plastic bags. These half-round samples yield reasonable results fo r some dissolved species, notably sulfate. Rhizon results generally li e close to those from squeezed samples at nearby depths. The manganese concentration profile does not show a peak in the uppermos t meter or so, which suggests the true mudline is missing. Adjacen t samples from the upper ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ of the section have large varianc e because the sediment is unconsolidated foraminiferal sand, whic h makes collection of uncontaminated pore water difficult. Nonetheless, most constituents do not vary much in concentration over th e uppermost $275\,\textrm{m}$ . Below $275\,\textrm{m}$ , sulfate concentrations decreas e downhole linearly and ammonium, barium, and strontium concentrations increase linearly or exponentially. The concomitant loss o f sulfate and rise in methane from ${\sim}500\;\mathrm{m}$ downhole suggests a dee p zone of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), which also may explain the abundant macroscopic pyrite at this depth interval.  

Bulk sediment carbonate content varies considerably wit h depth, with $100\;\mathrm{m}$ scale fluctuations between highs of ${\sim}95\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ an d lows of ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{\wt\%}$ that relate to the lithostratigraphic units. TO C content is $0.76\pm0.36\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ without any consistent downhole trend.  

All cores from Holes U1508A–U1508C were correlated with th e downhole logging data (on the wireline log matched depth belo w seafloor [WMSF] depth scale) using one tie per core. An offset tabl e allows users to approximate depths of core data on the core dept h below seafloor (CSF-A) depth scale to the WMSF depth scale of th e downhole logging data.  

LSRs were calculated for Site U1508 using calcareous nannofossil datums and polarity chron boundaries from 0 to $48\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Figure F11). LSRs in the Pliocene–Pleistocene vary between ${\sim}10$ an d $80\;\mathrm{m/My},$ , and they average ${\sim}20~\mathrm{m/My}$ during the early to late Miocene. The succession is condensed for most of the Oligocene despit e a short interval from 23 to $26~\mathrm{{Ma}}$ . LSRs for the late to middle Eocene are steady at ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{m/My}$ .  

# Site U1509 (southern New Caledonia Trough) Background and objectives  

Site U1509 (proposed Site NCTS-2A) is located ${\sim}640~\mathrm{km}$ wes t of the northern tip of New Zealand, ${\sim}300\,\mathrm{km}$ south of Site 206, an d ${\sim}200~\mathrm{km}$ north of DSDP Site 592. The location is on the wester n margin of the New Caledonia Trough at the base of the Lord How e Rise slope near the mouth of a canyon that drains around the northeast end of a small submerged spur (Sutherland et al., 2016). Thi s spur, inferred to have been created by deformation, is underlain b y the northeast-dipping limb of a west-verging fold that exposes strat a that can be traced beneath the axis of the New Caledonia Trough. Site U1509 was chosen to determine the timing of Cenozoic foldin g in the southern New Caledonia Trough and to obtain stratigraphi c constraints on the timing of vertical tectonic movements and volcanism.  

# Operations  

Hole U1509A: 34°39.1312′S, $165^{\circ}49.6599^{\prime}\mathrm{F}$ ; water depth $=2911\,\mathrm{m}$  

We arrived at Site U1509 at $1030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 September 2017 (UT C $+\,11\,\mathrm{h}$ ), completing the $273\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1508. RCB coring in Hole U1509A was initiated at $2145~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 September. Th e decision to use the RCB system was made after considering targe t depth, time constraints, and success at previous sites. Coring continued until $2345\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 September and reached $690.7\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF (Cor e 74R). Total recovery in Hole U1509A was $462.86\mathrm{~m~}(67\%)$ .  

Planned wireline logging in Hole U1509A was canceled becaus e of ship heave exceeding $_{3.0\textrm{m}}$ . Hole U1509A was ended at $1434~\mathrm{h}$ after a total of $127.5~\mathrm{h}$ or 5.3 days. At $1630~\mathrm{h}$ on 7 September, th e ship began a ${\sim}200\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit to the north to avoid severe weathe r forecast for 9–10 September; this weather also impacted operation s at the remaining drilling sites.  

# Principal results  

The sedimentary sequence at Site U1509 consists of ${\sim}415\mathrm{~m~}$ o f calcareous ooze, chalk, and limestone (Unit I) overlying ${\sim}275\mathrm{~m~}$ o f claystone (Unit II).  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I is divided into three subunits. Subuni t Ia $(0{-}99.6~\mathrm{m})$ consists of calcareous ooze and chalk with rare tuffaceous beds. RCB coring led to soupy and mousse-like drilling disturbance in the soft sediments of the upper ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m}$ of this subunit, followed by biscuiting, horizontal cracking, fracturing, and pulverization in the more indurated lower sediment of the unit. The ooze– chalk transition was observed at a remarkably shallow depth of ${\sim}55$ m. Subunit Ib $(99.6{-}139.28\;\mathrm{m})$ comprises calcareous chalk showin g significant soft-sediment deformation (i.e., slumps). Subunit I c $(139.28–414.57\ \mathrm{m})$ consists of calcareous chalk and limestone wit h biosilica and several silicified (chert) intervals. Subunit Ic is characterized distinctively by tilted bedding (apparent dip of ${\sim}20^{\circ}$ ). Fro m Subunit Ic downhole, preferential fracturing of cores was seen alon g primary deformation structures such as shear zones, microfaults, and tilted bedding. The chalk–limestone transition occurs in Subunit Ic at around $385\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Lithostratigraphic Unit II is divided into two subunits. Subuni t IIa $(414.57{-}614.2\ m)$ consists of claystone with nannofossils an d silt. Subunit IIb $(614.2{-}689.68\ \mathrm{m})$ ) consists of massive brown claystone with minor bioturbation and agglutinated benthic foraminifers. Similar to Subunit Ic, tilted bedding was observed throughou t Unit II.  

Nannofossil and planktic foraminifer preservation and abundance generally decrease downhole, with these groups absent belo w 617.6 and $536.0\ \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , respectively. Radiolarians are rare to abundan t and well preserved in the upper $393~\mathrm{m}$ but are rare and poorly preserved farther downhole. Benthic foraminifer abundance is low, an d preservation decreases downhole in the upper $249~\mathrm{m}$ and remain s poor below. Only agglutinated taxa are found in sediments belo w $617.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Ostracods are common to rare with moderate to poo r preservation in the upper $178\,\textrm{m}$ and are rare to barren below.  A palynological reconnaissance study focused on Unit II and recovered rich and well-preserved assemblages.  

Nannofossil and foraminifer datums yielded Miocene (22.41– $82.47\;\mathrm{m})$ , Oligocene $(90.13{-}248.63\ \mathrm{m})$ , Eocene $(259.98{-}407.07\ \mathrm{m})$ , and Paleocene $(418.53\mathrm{-}609.27\,\mathrm{~m})$ ages for the sequence in Hol e U1509A (Figure F11). The interval from 617.6 to $689.6~\mathrm{m}$ is barre n of age-diagnostic nannofossils and planktic foraminifer taxa bu t contains Late Cretaceous dinocysts and agglutinated benthic foraminifers.  Benthic  foraminifers  indicate  deposition  in  a  lowe r bathyal–abyssal environment during the Pleistocene to Eocene an d at middle bathyal depths during the Paleocene and Cretaceous.  

The NRM intensity of most sediment cores from Hole U1509 A is weak, mostly around $10^{-4}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ , which results in generally nois y paleomagnetic data from the pass-through magnetometer. However, step-wise AF demagnetization of some discrete samples give s reliable paleomagnetic data. Integrating these data with biostratigraphy, the observed magnetic polarity values at 110 to ${\sim}260\mathrm{~m~}$ ar e tentatively correlated with Chrons C9 through C13 of GPTS2012. The claystone interval of Subunit IIb produces higher quality passthrough data compared with intervals above. Subunit IIb cores hav e a normal magnetic polarity.  

Physical properties measurements on Hole U1509A cores exhibit gradual changes in bulk density and $P$ -wave velocity wit h depth, except across a layer of limestone between $\mathord{\sim}390$ and $415~\mathrm{m}$ . Through the ooze and chalk, above the limestone, $P.$ -wave velocit y and bulk density increase with depth from 1500 to $1900~\mathrm{m/s}$ an d from 1.55 to $1.90~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ , respectively. The transition from ooze t o chalk is shallow $\left(\sim\!55\mathrm{~m}\right)$ and correlates with a $P$ -wave velocity increase of ${\sim}100~\mathrm{m/s}$ . The limestone of Subunit Ic represents a discrete interval where $P$ -wave velocity and density increase by ${\sim}40\%$ and porosity decreases sharply. $P$ -wave velocity, bulk density, an d MS are approximately constant in the Unit II claystone below th e limestone. A gradual decrease in porosity with depth was also observed. NGR values show high variance in Unit II (from 8 to 3 0 counts/s), reflecting changes in clay composition and abundance.  

A total of $23\ \mathrm{IW}$ samples were collected from Hole U1509A. Profiles of some species show trends similar to those at Site U1508. For example, sulfate concentrations decrease and ammonium concentrations increase downhole, suggesting sulfate reduction of particulate organic matter and release of nitrogen to pore water. Furthermore, at ${\sim}370\;\mathrm{m},$ , sulfate concentrations drop below $1.0\:\mathrm{mM}$ and methane concentrations start to rise, suggesting further sulfat e consumption by AOM at a deep sulfate–methane transition (SMT). Sulfate reduction leads to the production of hydrogen sulfide, whic h reacts with iron to form pyrite (Snyder et al., 2007), which is presen t in many cores from this hole. Below the SMT, headspace methan e concentrations increase to 15,000 ppmv and dissolved Ba concentrations increase to $0.4\;\mathrm{mM}$ . Such values are common to slope environments of many continental margins.  

Bulk  sediment  chemistry  corresponds  to  lithostratigraphi c units. Unit I is characterized by carbonate content that decrease s downhole from ${\sim}94\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ at $20\;\mathrm{m}$ to ${\sim}65~\mathrm{wt\%}$ between 360 and 38 0 m. Carbonate content varies little in the uppermost $200\ \mathrm{m}$ but b y more than $10\%$ in the lower part of the unit. Carbonate conten t drops drastically across the Unit I–II transition $(415~\mathrm{m})$ to averag e values of 18 and $0.5\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ in Subunits IIa and IIb, respectively. TO C content is ${\sim}0.3\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ in Unit I and Subunit IIa and ${\sim}1.0\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ in Uppe r Cretaceous Subunit IIb.  

# Site U1510 (southern Lord Howe Rise)  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1510 (proposed Site LHRS-3A) is located on the souther n Lord Howe Rise, ${\sim}850\,\mathrm{km}$ west of northern New Zealand and ${\sim}495$ km south of Site 206. Site U1510 is ${\sim}80~\mathrm{km}$ west of Site 592 an d ${\sim}105\,\mathrm{km}$ northwest of Site 207. Seismic reflection data can be use d to tie stratigraphy at the three sites but with some uncertaint y caused by unconformities and deformation (Sutherland et al., 2016). Site U1510 was chosen to determine the timing of Cenozoic foldin g on the southern Lord Howe Rise and to constrain the timing of regional tectonic movements and volcanism. The primary drilling objectives at Site U1510 were to (1) constrain the depths and ages fo r the top and base of the syntectonic seismic unit, (2) determine th e nature of the lowest seismic unit and pretectonic state of the southern Lord Howe Rise, and (3) collect evidence for volcanism or vertical movements, especially including sediments representing nearb y shallow water of any age. A secondary objective was to collect a continuous late Neogene record for paleoceanographic studies.

Hole U1510A: 36°19.7385′S, $164^{\circ}33.5220^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; water depth $=1238\,\mathrm{m}$ Hole U1510B: 36°19.7392′S, $164^{\circ}33.5347^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$ ; water depth $=1238\;\mathrm{m}$  

After the $380\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit in heavy winds and seas from a waitin g on weather location, the ship arrived at Site U1510 at $0918\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 2 September 2017 $\mathrm{(UTC+11\,h)}$ ).  

An APC/XCB BHA was deployed, and coring in Hole U1510 A started at $1915~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 September. Cores 1H through 17H penetrated from 0 to $150.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF and recovered $147.9\mathrm{~m~}$ $(98\%)$ . W e stopped deploying the orientation tool after Core 15H. Temperatur e measurements were taken on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, 13H, and 17H. We continued with XCB coring until $1930\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 September. Core s 18X through 52X penetrated from 150.5 to $483.4\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF and recovered $108.1\textrm{m}$ $(32\%)$ . Recovery over portions of this depth interval was seriously compromised because of frequent chert layers. Corin g in Hole U1510A concluded on 14 September with a total penetration to $483.4~\mathrm{m}$ DSF and total recovery of $260.0\;\mathrm{m}$ $(53\%)$ . The tim e spent on Hole U1510A was $60\,\mathrm{{h}}$ or 2.5 days.  

The ship was offset $20\textrm{m}$ to the east, and APC coring in Hol e U1510B began at $2300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 September and ended at $0215~\mathrm{h}$ o n 15 September. Cores 1H through 7H penetrated from 0 to $66.3~\mathrm{m}$ DSF and recovered $64.7\mathrm{~m~}$ $(98\%)$ . An APCT-3 temperature measurement was taken on Core 7H. Operations in Hole U1510B and a t Site U1510 ended at $0815~\mathrm{h}$ on 15 September. The time spent o n Hole U1510B was $10.75\,\mathrm{h}$ or 0.4 days. At $0842\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , the ship began th e transit to Site U1511.  

# Principal results  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I $\left(0{-}138.0\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ is composed of calcareou s ooze and is divided into two subunits. Subunit Ia $(0{-}60.0\ \mathrm{m})$ consists of subtle color banding between light gray and white calcareous  ooze.  Subunit  Ib $\left(60.0{-}138.0\ \mathrm{~m}\right)$ is  white  homogeneou s calcareous ooze. The Unit I/II boundary is defined by the first occurrence of chert at $138\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Lithostratigraphic Unit II $(138.0{-}418.1\,\mathrm{m})$ ) consists of ${\sim}340\;\mathrm{m}$ o f calcareous ooze and chalk interbedded with cherty limestone an d chert. Unit II is divided into three subunits. Subunit IIa is a ${\sim}9.5\mathrm{~m~}$ thick white homogeneous nannofossil ooze with bioclasts. The upper ${\sim}30~\mathrm{cm}$ of Subunit IIa consists of centimeter-sized extraclast s composed of chert, cherty limestone, and lithic clasts. Although thi s interval could be affected by drilling disturbance (i.e., “fall-in” at th e top of the core), it also contains the first occurrence of chert; simila r material had not been found in the cores above. Subunit IIb (147.5– $349.4\;\mathrm{m})$ ) is a $201.9\;\mathrm{m}$ thick interval of light gray moderately bioturbated clayey calcareous chalk with scattered shallow-water bioclast s interbedded with cherty limestone. Subunit IIc $(349.4–478.1\,\mathrm{m})$ is  a $128.7\textrm{m}$ thick homogeneous white nannofossil chalk interbedde d with chert and sparse volcaniclastic beds in the lower portion of th e subunit.  

Core recovery in Unit I was near $100\%$ , with coring disturbanc e limited to up-arching and soupy sediments. Recovery dropped t o $\sim\!20\%$ in Subunits IIa and IIb because of the presence of chert an d cherty limestone and the use of the XCB coring system, and drillin g disturbance included severe fracturing of chert and cherty limestone intervals and moderate to severe biscuiting of calcareou s chalk intervals.  

Nannofossils are generally abundant with moderate preservation. Planktic foraminifer abundance and preservation decreas e downhole (from 215 and $\boldsymbol{187}\,\mathrm{\,m},$ , respectively), with a few barre n samples. Radiolarians are rare throughout, except for a short middl e Miocene interval (109.6 to $119.7\ \mathrm{m})$ ) where radiolarians are common. Radiolarian preservation is good in the upper $135\;\mathrm{m}$ and poo r farther downhole. Benthic foraminifers were recovered at generall y low abundance from all cores, with very good preservation for th e Neogene and generally poor preservation for the Paleogene. Ostracods are very abundant in most samples, with good preservatio n from 0 to $\mathord{\sim}150\;\mathrm{m}$ and poor preservation below. Because of weathe r constraints on processing, no samples from Site U1510 were analyzed for palynology. Paleodepth was lower bathyal from the Pleistocene through the Eocene. During the late and middle Eocene,  a significant component of the benthic fauna appears to be derive d from shallower (shelf, upper bathyal, and middle bathyal) sources.  

Based on nannofossil and foraminifer biostratigraphy, the following ages were determined for the sequence in Hole U1510A: Pleistocene $(5.0{-}33.5\mathrm{~m)}$ , Pliocene $(43.1{-}70.3\mathrm{~m})$ , Miocene (72.3– $135.4\;\mathrm{m})$ ), and late, middle, and early Eocene (138.8–147.7, 150.5– 438.9, and $448.9–478.2\;\mathrm{m}_{\cdot}$ , respectively).  

The low NRM intensity of most cores, low core recovery, an d significant core disturbance from XCB coring make it difficult to establish shipboard magnetostratigraphy at Site U1510.  

Physical properties measurements show a gradual increase i n bulk density and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity with depth in the nannofossil an d foraminiferal ooze of Unit I. In Subunits IIa and IIb, from 140 t o ${\sim}350\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , physical properties measurements are less reliable an d sparse because of drilling disturbance and low recovery, respectively. Bulk density $({\sim}1.75~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ and $P$ -wave velocity $({\sim}1750~\mathrm{m/s})$ increase downhole to $300\;\mathrm{m}$ and then decrease again to the base o f Subunit IIb, where fewer chert layers were observed. MS and NG R both increase downhole in these two subunits and then decrease toward the base of Subunit IIb. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity peaks and spikes i n NGR in Subunit IIc correlate with sandstone and claystone. Nea r the base of the hole $\left({\sim}470\mathrm{~m}\right)$ , where sediments become more lithified, density and velocity increase and porosity decreases.  

Headspace samples from Site U1510 yielded hydrocarbon ga s concentrations below detection limits.  

A total of 118 IW samples were taken from Site U1510 b y squeezing whole-round sediment and Rhizon sampling (Dickens e t al., 2007). Ca concentrations increase downhole and $\mathrm{Mg}$ and K concentrations decrease, similar to Sites U1506 and U1507. These profiles may result from the reaction of pore water with volcani c material in the sediment. Sulfate and ammonium concentratio n profiles mirror each other, suggesting sulfate reduction of organi c matter. Dissolved Sr, Si, Li, and B concentrations increase downhole, likely reflecting dissolution of biogenic carbonate and silica. Dissolved Mn and Fe concentrations decrease in the uppermost  1 m, suggesting the true mudline is missing. Dissolved Fe concentrations in Rhizon samples decrease rapidly over the upper 8 to $10\;\mathrm{m}$ , consistent with the odor of $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ at ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Carbonate content is ${>}90\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ in Unit I and in Subunits IIa an d IIc, corresponding to calcareous ooze and chalk lithologies. In Subunit IIb, carbonate content decreases downhole toward the middl e of the subunit, and $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ decreases and NGR increases. Interbedde d cherty and tuffaceous layers are distinguished by carbonate contents of ${<}50$ and ${<}20\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ , respectively. TOC content is mostly below the detection limit but is represented by somewhat highe r values $(0.35\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ below $400\:\mathrm{m}$ .  

Coring in Hole U1510B was monitored in near real tim e through out-of-sequence measurement of whole-round sections. Using primarily NGR data, Hole U1510A and U1510B cores wer e depth shifted to construct a composite depth scale. A spliced recor d was generated using the composite scale, which provides a continuous record of the top ${\sim}44\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment at Site U1510.  

# Site U1511 (Tasman Abyssal Plain)  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1511 (proposed Site TASS-2A) is located on the Tasma n Abyssal Plain, ${\sim}945\,\mathrm{km}$ east of Australia and ${\sim}990\,\mathrm{km}$ northwest o f New Zealand. Site U1511 lies west of Lord Howe Rise on oceani c crust of Late Cretaceous age that is thought to have formed durin g Chron C33 $(74-84\mathrm{~Ma})$ . Regional seismic reflection data reveal  a thick $^{\leftmoon}300\mathrm{~m})$ sequence of sediments deformed by reverse fault s and folds (Sutherland et al., 2016). Site U1511 was chosen to fin d the age of this deformation and provide the second comprehensiv e record of sedimentation on the Tasman Abyssal Plain. The primar y drilling objectives at Site U1511 were to sample (1) the top of th e middle seismic unit to constrain the age of folding and (2) the rest o f the sedimentary sequence to develop an understanding of this significant abyssal location. The only previous scientific borehole int o Tasman Abyssal Plain sediments was drilled in 1973 at DSDP Sit e 283, $870\,\mathrm{km}$ to the southwest and on conjugate crust of Late Cretaceous age east of southeast Australia.

The ship completed the transit from Site U1510 and arrived a t Site U1511 at $1248\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 September 2017 $\mathrm{(UTC+11h)}$ ). RCB coring in Hole U1511A began at $0425\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 September. After retrieving Core 3R, the drill string had to be pulled clear of the seafloo r because of excessive heave and wind. Cores 1R through 3R penetrated from 0 to $26.6~\mathrm{m}$ DSF and recovered $7.9~\mathrm{m}$ $30\%)$ . A total o f $19.25\,\mathrm{h}$ or 0.8 days were spent on Hole U1511A.  

After waiting $17~\mathrm{h}$ because of weather, Hole U1511B was initiated at $0145\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 September by washing down (i.e., drilling without coring and without a center bit installed) to $19.8\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Corin g resumed at $0215\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 September, and Cores 2R through 7R penetrated from 19.8 to $77.2\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{DSF}$ . A center bit was deployed, and th e interval from 77.2 to $192.2\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF was drilled without coring to ensure we could reach the target depth in the remaining time of th e expedition. Coring resumed at $1500\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 September, and Core s 9R through 41R penetrated from 192.2 to $508.8\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. At $1600\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 20 September, coring was suspended because of excessive heave, and the drill string was raised above the bottom of the hole. As th e swell began to subside at $1030~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 September, the drill strin g was lowered back to the bottom of the hole. After pumping a $25~\mathrm{bbl}$ mud sweep, coring resumed at $1600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 September and ende d with the recovery of the last core (47R) at $0450\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 September. The total cored interval in Hole U1511B was $431.4~\mathrm{m}$ DSF, and recovery was $279.3\;\mathrm{m}$ $(65\%)$ . Two intervals were drilled without coring for a total of $134.8\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

The rig floor was secured for transit to Hobart at $1630~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 2 September, ending Hole U1511B and Site U1511. A total of $110.75\,\mathrm{h}$ or 4.6 days were spent on Hole U1511B. The total time at Sit e U1511 was $130.0\ \mathrm{h}$ or 5.4 days, including $40.5~\mathrm{h}$ lost because o f weather.  

# Principal results  

The three lithostratigraphic units described are differentiated b y the presence or absence of microfossils. Unit I $(0{-}77.2\;\mathrm{m})$ is ${\sim}80\;\mathrm{m}$ of gray to brown clay with calcareous nannofossils restricted to th e lowermost $40~\mathrm{{cm}}$ of the unit. Unit II $(201.9\substack{-403.4\;\mathrm{m}})$ is separate d from Unit I by a ${\sim}120~\mathrm{m}$ drilled interval and consists of ${\sim}200\mathrm{~m~}$ o f greenish gray to yellowish brown diatomite with minor abundance s of clay and other siliceous microfossils (radiolarians, sponge spicules, ebridians, and silicoflagellates). Unit III $(403.4\substack{-560.7\,\mathrm{~m}})$ i s $\mathord{\sim}150\;\mathrm{m}$ of claystone. A ${\sim}30~\mathrm{m}$ reddish brown interval near the to p of Unit III contains minor abundances of radiolarians. A ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{~m~}$ grayish green interval near the bottom of the unit contains mino r abundances of calcareous nannofossils.  

A variety of secondary minerals are present throughout Sit e U1511, attesting to diagenesis and alteration. Manganese nodule s and black specks of sulfides occur in Unit I, whereas sporadic centimeter-scale nodules and specks of pink rhodochrosite occur in Uni t II. Several centimeter-scale intervals of greenish gray claystone i n Units II and III contain sand-sized grains of native copper surrounded by dark green halos. The lower part of Unit II also contain s cristobalite and an interval of red and pink fluorapatite. Furthermore, a color gradient across Unit III from red and reddish brown a t the top of the unit to greenish gray toward the base, with alternations of the two colors in the intervening interval, seems to be related to trace amounts of redox-sensitive metal oxides. Thes e minerals suggest a complex history of diagenesis and alteration, th e latter possibly mediated by past fluid flow.  

Calcareous nannofossils and planktic foraminifers are generall y absent throughout Site U1511. When present, their abundances an d preservation states are varied. Radiolarians are present from 192 t o $547\,\mathrm{m}$ and are abundant from 209 to $394\,\mathrm{m}$ , with good preservation. Below, radiolarians are less abundant and poorly preserved.  

Benthic foraminifers are sparse in the Pliocene to lower Eocen e interval, where a low-diversity agglutinated assemblage was recognized. The transition to a higher diversity Paleocene to lowermos t Eocene assemblage was observed at the contact between lithostratigraphic Units II and III. The Paleocene interval contains both agglutinated and calcareous taxa. Samples are barren of ostracods an d palynomorphs. Given the overall microfossil assemblages, the location of Site U1511 has probably been abyssal and beneath or nea r the calcite compensation depth (CCD) since the Paleocene.  

Rare nannofossils and planktic foraminifers found through th e Pliocene, Miocene, lower Oligocene, and Paleocene intervals wer e used to constrain age where possible (Figure F11). Based on planktic foraminifers, Pliocene $(7.5{-}7.6\;\mathrm{m})$ , lower Pliocene to upper Miocene $(7.5{-}47.6\;\mathrm{m})$ , and possible Miocene $(65.6{-}65.7\;\mathrm{m})$ strata wer e recognized. Based on calcareous nannofossils, the lower Oligocen e $(192.2{-}204.0\;\mathrm{m})$ ) was identified; however, sediments from this level may have come from the drilled interval and may not be in situ.  

Based on radiolarian biostratigraphy, upper Eocene (209–23 5 m), lower to middle Eocene $(235{-}389\ \mathrm{m})$ , and Paleocene (432–53 9 m) strata were recognized. The lower to middle Paleocene (538.8– $539.4\;\mathrm{m})$ ) was also identified based on nannofossil biostratigraphy.  

High-quality paleomagnetic data were obtained across interval s of Units II and III. In Cores 371-U1511B-14R through 30R $^{\sim240-}$ $400\ \mathrm{m})$ , all polarity reversals from the base of Chron $C17\mathrm{n}.3\mathrm{n}$ t o Chron C21n were identified, indicating that Unit II in Hole U1511 B spans from $\mathord{\sim}38$ to $47.5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Bartonian–Lutetian). Four magneti c polarity reversals in Core 38R can be successfully correlated wit h Chrons C24n.1n to $C24.2\mathfrak{n}$ $\left({\sim}53\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ ).  

The remanence intensity of sediments from Units II and III exhibits possible cycles. These variations appear related to lithologi c color changes, where brown intervals generally have a higher magnetization compared with the lower magnetization in the gray sediment intervals. Such changes may be related to magnetic mineral diagenesis. Many samples in Unit III show magnetically hard NR M behavior that is resistant to AF demagnetization. Such a hard remanence component is carried by hematite, which probably contributes to the reddish sediment color in Unit III.  

Cube samples from Units II and III show reliable AMS data an d distinct patterns for Units II and III. Samples from Unit II indicate  a random orientation of the AMS tensor, which probably reflects  a random deposition of minerals without sediment compaction. I n contrast, sediments from Unit III exhibit a well-defined oblate AM S fabric, which is typical for compacted sedimentary rocks.  

Porosity decreases downhole from $80\%$ to $65\%$ in Unit I along  a trend typical for pelagic clay. This trend continues in Unit III (fro m $60\%$ to $45\%$ ). In Unit II, however, porosity is offset to extremely hig h values $(70\%{-}83\%)$ . This general profile is mirrored in bulk densit y and is attributed to the diatomite with clay in Unit II. $P.$ -wave velocity increases linearly downhole, except for two peaks, one in th e lower part of Unit II $\mathrm{1750\;m/s})$ and the other in the middle part o f Unit III $(1850~\mathrm{m/s})$ . MS values vary between 5 and $50\;\mathrm{IU}$ in Unit  I and near the top of Unit III and are much lower in Unit II and in th e lower part of Unit III. NGR has a similar trend, and both MS an d NGR appear to correspond to clay content. All color reflectance parameters $(\mathbf{L}^{*},\,\mathbf{a}^{*})$ , and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ ) increase downhole from 200 to $300\;\mathrm{m}$ an d then decrease from 300 to $400\;\mathrm{m}$ , corresponding to the diatomite i n Unit II. A step increase in bulk density $(1.50\mathrm{-}1.75\:\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ , MS, NGR, and $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ and $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ , associated with a decrease in porosity (from $70\%$ t o $52\%$ ), is attributed to a red claystone interval in the top of Unit II I $(\sim\!410\;\mathrm{m})$ .  

Headspace samples from Site U1511 yielded no light hydrocarbon gas concentrations above detection limits.  

Low carbonate $(<\!15\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ ) and TOC $(<\!0.4\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ contents prevai l throughout the sedimentary column at Site U1511. Carbonate content only rises ${>}1\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ in samples from two intervals: at the botto m of Unit I $(71{-}77\;\mathrm{m})$ and in the lower half of Unit III $(490{-}539\;\mathrm{m})$ ).  

A total of 50 IW samples were collected at Site U1511 by tw o methods: squeezing and Rhizon sampling. At the precision require d to understand basic processes at Site U1511, squeeze and Rhizo n samples give similar profiles for most dissolved species. These profiles show some general trends and some unusual features, reflecting a combination of lithology and multiple processes.  

As also observed at other Expedition 371 sites, modest oxidation of particulate organic carbon leads to production of alkalinit y and $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ and removal of $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ . Limited dissolution of biogenic silica occurs, which increases dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{4}\mathrm{SiO}_{4}$ (particularly in Uni t  

II). Dissolved Ca increases downhole and dissolved $\mathrm{Mg}$ and K decrease, suggesting reactions with silicate minerals. However, th e change in Ca relative to $\mathrm{Mg}$ with respect to depth is much greater a t Site U1511 than at other Expedition 371 sites, which probably results from reactions with underlying basalt rather than sediment o r continental crust. Many species display an inflection in concentrations at ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ and a major drop in concentrations at ${\sim}400\;\mathrm{m}$ . Th e first change probably results from the major increase in porosity associated with diatomite; the latter change probably represents th e conversion of biosilica to cristobalite and the release of water. Dissolved Mn increases slightly in the upper $^{80\textrm{m}}$ but sharply belo w $200\ \mathrm{m}$ , reaching an extreme of $357~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at $421\;\mathrm{m}$ . Such high value s suggest dissolution of Mn oxides in the lower layer of the sedimen t column. Ammonium concentrations are below the detection limi t across the uppermost $20\ \mathrm{m}$ , which may indicate a deep horizon o f ammonia oxidation.  

Physical properties, paleomagnetic, and biostratigraphic dat a were compiled to locate middle Eocene climate events in Hol e U1511B. Interpretation of magnetic inclination and radiolarian assemblages indicates the MECO was recovered in Core 371-U1511B16R. The putative Chron C19r hyperthermal event (Edgar et al., 2007) may be present in Core 18R, based on natural magnetic remanence data.  

# Summary of scientific results Results compared with objectives  

Expedition 371 targeted Paleogene sediment sequences acros s an extensive area of northern Zealandia with multiple objectives. The main goal was to obtain stratigraphic records of subductio n zone initiation in the southwest Pacific and hence complement results from Expeditions 350, 351, and 352 in the northwest Pacific. We successfully completed this objective by coring at six sites tha t were optimally located on the basis of local and regional seismic reflection lines and from consideration of regional structure and plat e motion history. A summary of spatial and temporal relationship s discovered is shown in Figure F12.  

Secondary objectives were designed to address aspects of regional paleoceanography. Three previous scientific drilling expeditions to the Tasman Sea (Legs 21, 29, and 90) focused on Cenozoi c paleoceanography of the region and led to several key insights. However, this work, as nicely summarized by Kennett and von de r Borch (1986), also highlights biases in the paleoceanographic literature: (1) the proportion of text that discusses the Paleogene as compared  with  the  Neogene  is  approximately $26\%$ ,  whereas  th e Paleogene represents ${\sim}65\%$ of the combined geological time; (2) conclusions come from extrapolations across a vast and poorl y mapped area; and (3) the detailed records come without full consideration of diagenetic reactions. Expedition 371 was an opportunit y to address each of these issues: (1) our focus was on understandin g Paleogene stratigraphy; (2) our site selection was grounded by  a greatly expanded geophysical data set; and (3) our shipboard chemistry and physical properties measurements were far more extensiv e than possible when the previous drilling was conducted more tha n 30 years ago. Under very high atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ conditions or hig h climate sensitivity, global climate models (Huber and Caballero, 2011; Lunt et al., 2012) can reasonably simulate early Eocene warming in many regions (Douglas et al., 2014; Tripati et al., 2003) but no t the extreme warmth inferred for the southwest Pacific and Southern Ocean (Bijl et al., 2009; Hollis et al., 2009, 2012; Pross et al., 2012), making it important to gain better-resolved SST reconstruc

tions from this region. Furthermore, because this mismatch coul d be related to errors in paleogeographic reconstructions, the primar y tectonic science objective of Expedition 371 relates to secondar y objectives.  

Our results advance our understanding of compaction and diagenesis of bathyal sediment. We find that sediment accumulatio n and diagenesis across the Tasman Sea were variable in space an d time and can be related to differences in sedimentation type an d tectonic history. Our data sets of physical properties, chemistry, burial depth, and sediment composition provide a diverse view o f bathyal sediments deposited on oceanic rises distant from land. Empirical relationships may be derived from these data that can b e applied elsewhere and used to understand underlying processes o f compaction and diagenesis.  

Observations made at our six sites represent a substantial gai n in knowledge about northern Zealandia, a large underexplored region. The only previous boreholes that penetrated strata older tha n late Eocene were at Sites 206, 207, and 208 (Shipboard Scientifi c Party, 1973a, 1973b, 1973c), and these sites were drilled in 1971 (Le g 21), before regional seismic reflection data were available and th e context of sites was understood. It was widely accepted that th e stratigraphic development of the region was simple: Cretaceous rif t to drift processes created the first-order physiography and initial subsidence; additional subsidence during the Cenozoic only secondarily affected the region (Figure F13).  

Expedition 371 was founded on high-quality seismic reflectio n data that raised new ideas about how the region had evolved, specifically the recently discovered Tectonic Event of the Cenozoic in th e Tasman Area (TECTA) (Sutherland et al., 2010, 2017; Collot et al.,  

Figure F13. A widely held hypothesis for stratigraphic development of th e region studied during Expedition 371 is that Cretaceous rifting (bottom) wa s followed by transgression (middle) and development of deep water (top ) before the end of the Cretaceous. Further subsidence then led to the existing geography. This hypothesis is not consistent with our finding of Eocen e fossils indicative of shallow water on the crest of the Lord Howe Rise, extensive Paleogene erosion surfaces, and widespread reverse faulting of Eocen e age.  

2008, 2009; Bache et al., 2012, 2014a; Baur et al., 2014; Rouillard e t al., 2017; Etienne et al., 2018). We drilled six sites to test these idea s by focusing on the timing of deformation, the uplift and subsidenc e history, and the presence of past volcanism. The sites greatly increased the available material from Eocene and older strata on submerged portions of Zealandia (Figure F14). Only two continents o n Earth remain largely unexplored: Antarctica and Zealandia. Therefore, our new regional stratigraphic knowledge, which has significance for understanding regional paleogeographic, climatic, an d biotic evolution, is of global interest.

Figure F14. Site locations in relation to regional seismic stratigraphic relationships. Pink layers are interpreted to be those deposited during times of activ e uplift, erosion, volcanism, and reverse faulting. In the northern New Caledonia Trough (Site U1507), the basal layer was assumed to be Cretaceous to Eocene i n age, as indicated by drilling elsewhere, but our new results indicate it may be entirely Eocene in age.  

Observations at Sites U1508–U1511 place age constraints o n the timing of convergent plate failure at the southern end of the subduction system in the southwest Pacific. Results from Site U150 7 provide a unique new insight into subduction initiation adjacent t o New Caledonia. Conclusions presented here are based on highquality age models tied to seismic reflection images at each site.  

At Site U1507, we collected the first record of sedimentation i n the northern New Caledonia Trough. Almost all previous publications have assumed that this part of the sedimentary basin was created during Cretaceous rifting (e.g., Auzende et al., 2000; Lafoy e t al., 2005; Schellart et al., 2006; Cluzel et al., 2012; Matthews et al., 2015). In our predrilling analysis of seismic reflection data, we identified three seismic units: (1) an upper onlapping unit, (2) a downlapping middle unit that indicated a period of high sediment suppl y from Norfolk Ridge, and (3) a lower unit of continuous reflector s with subunits in its lower part and a normal-faulted base. The hypothesis we tested by drilling was that the lower unit was formed b y Cretaceous rifting and then postrift subsidence, the middle uni t corresponded to deformation of Norfolk Ridge during subductio n initiation, and the upper unit represented sediment accumulatio n under conditions similar to the present. We discovered that th e middle unit (lithostratigraphic Subunits Ib and Ic at Site U1507) wa s composed of clayey chalk with volcaniclastic deposits ranging in ag e from 36 to $20\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . Basement rock was not reached, but the $170\;\mathrm{m}$ o f clayey nannofossil chalk cored (lithostratigraphic Unit II) from th e lower seismic unit is Eocene age and much younger than expected. Additional chemical analyses are required to test whether the influ x of volcaniclastic sediments starting in the late Eocene is a signal o f early arc development.  

![](images/422a30b635728108d754997d5696e65ace4a4469d53423a0128373ccaa2ce706.jpg)  

At Site U1508, folding in Reinga Basin is interpreted from onla p relationships  in  seismic  reflection  data  (indicating  depositio n against tilted strata) to have started during the transition fro m deposition of lithostratigraphic Subunit IIIb (bioturbated nannofossil chalk and limestone) to Subunit IIIa (bioturbated claye y nannofossil chalk with centimeter-scale siliceous intervals). Th e lithostratigraphic transition is dated from radiolarians and calcareous nannofossils to have occurred at $39{-}38\,\mathrm{~Ma}$ (late middle Eocene). Evidence for reworking of middle Eocene to Paleocen e microfossils in the Subunit IIIa upper Eocene strata supports th e seismic stratigraphic interpretation. The age of folding cessation i s not clear from stratigraphic relationships at Site U1508, but undeformed limestone caps the eroded crest of a fold in Reinga Basi n (western basin margin, Wanganella Ridge) and constrains folding t o have stopped there by $36{-}30\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Sutherland et al., 2017). Thes e conclusions are consistent with 53–43 Ma ages of the youngest deformed rocks exposed at the seabed near fold crests elsewhere i n the Reinga Basin (Browne et al., 2016; Sutherland et al., 2017).  

Site U1509 is located on the flank of a reverse-faulted fold at th e western margin of southern New Caledonia Trough. Chalk fro m lithostratigraphic Subunit Ib is characterized by slumped interval s containing overturned folds and sharp-based, convoluted to parallel-laminated beds. A brecciated and severely faulted interval occurs at the base of Subunit Ib $({\sim}137{-}139\mathrm{~m})$ ). Strata of Subunit I c chalk and limestone with biosilica are tilted, with an average apparent dip of ${\sim}22^{\circ}$ . The age of transition is $29{-}26\ \mathrm{Ma}$ from lithostratigraphic Subunit Ic to Subunit Ib and 24–23 Ma from Subunit Ib t o Subunit Ia. Reworked late to middle Eocene nannofossils and foraminifers were identified in Subunit Ib and the basal part of Subuni t Ia $(61.68{-}135.22\mathrm{~m};$ lower Miocene to upper Oligocene). The reworking of sediment and structural relationships indicates that a local slope failure occurred during deposition of Subunit Ib (29–2 3 Ma). Seismic stratigraphic relationships show Unit II claystone i s parallel-bedded and affected by deep-seated deformation. Detachment surfaces imaged on seismic reflection data in Paleocene claystone (Subunit IIa) may represent basal surfaces of local slop e failure. Slope failure may have been synchronous with deep-seate d folding and faulting, or folding may have occurred and been drape d with some (or all) Subunit Ic strata before slope failure occurred. Therefore, the age of folding has a poorly constrained Eocene t o Oligocene age.  

Site U1510 is on the southern Lord Howe Rise, where revers e faults offset a sequence characterized by parallel continuous reflections. Lithostratigraphic Unit II was rapidly deposited $(\mathrm{LSR}=20{-}50$ $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{M}\mathbf{y})$ during 46–37 Ma, and rapid sedimentation may have starte d as early as $48\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . Seismic stratigraphic relationships and evidenc e in cores for volcanism and sediment reworking indicate that hig h sedimentation rate was linked with tectonic activity.  

Site U1511 is on the Tasman Abyssal Plain adjacent to a reversefaulted fold that deforms the sedimentary sequence. The unit we infer from seismic interpretation to be syntectonic in its upper part i s highly reflective, and the correlative lithostratigraphic Unit II i s composed of diatomite and clay. The age of the upper part of Unit I I indicates fault activity occurred during $46{-}38\ \mathrm{Ma}$ .  

# Uplift and subsidence of ridges  

Bathyal Late Cretaceous and Paleocene sediments were sample d at Sites 207 and 208 on Lord Howe Rise (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1973b, 1973c), and Late Cretaceous magnetic anomalies were identified on marginal ocean crust of the Tasman Sea (Hayes and Ringis, 1973). These observations, combined with interpretations of spars e seismic reflection data, have led almost all previous workers to conclude that Cretaceous rift (crustal thinning) and postrift (thermal diffusion) subsidence processes were primary controls on the physiographic evolution of Lord Howe Rise and New Caledonia Troug h (e.g., Auzende et al., 2000; Lafoy et al., 2005; Schellart et al., 2006; Cluzel et al., 2012; Matthews et al., 2015) (Figure F13).  

Paleogene stratigraphy from Legs 21, 29, and 90 was used to infer dramatic changes in oceanography during the Paleogene associated with thermal isolation of Antarctica by seafloor spreading an d hence development of the modern system of thermohaline circulation (Kennett, 1977). A prominent Eocene–Oligocene unconformity is recognized in the southwest Pacific and interpreted by man y authors to have formed in deep water during the onset of the AC C (Edwards, 1973; Kennett et al., 1975; Kennett and von der Borch, 1986). Sutherland et al. (2010) mapped this unconformity on Lor d Howe Rise and noted concordant (flat) erosional unconformitie s that were tentatively interpreted to be surfaces produced by se a level–modulated erosion. Such a model requires that Lord How e Rise was transiently uplifted to sea level during the Paleogene an d subsequently subsided by $>\!1\,\mathrm{km}$ .  

Results from Site U1506 confirm that at least at this locality th e northern Lord Howe Rise was near sea level during the Eocene. Sediment cored at Site U1506 is composed of nannofossil ooze an d chalk with foraminifers $\langle264.6\,\mathrm{m}$ thick). The thick $(258.2\,\mathrm{m})$ Pleistocene to middle Miocene $(0{-}14\;\mathrm{Ma})$ subunit contains lower bathyal benthic microfossil assemblages that indicate paleowater depth s similar to the present $(1495\;\mathrm{m})$ , with an unconformity at the base o f this subunit. A thin $\left(6.1\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ , upper Oligocene $(25{-}23\ \mathrm{Ma})$ chalk beneath this unconformity contains lower bathyal assemblages bu t transitions at its base into a highly condensed $_{(0.4\mathrm{~m})}$ , burrowe d glauconitic chalk containing an upper bathyal $200{-}600\ \mathrm{m}$ wate r depth) assemblage, with ostracod and benthic foraminifer specie s indicative of shelf depths also present but inferred to have bee n transported downslope. The glauconitic base of the sedimentary sequence is middle Eocene age $({\sim}45\,\mathrm{\Ma})$ . Underlying basalt flow s contain many calcite-filled amygdules and a Neptunian dike $\leftrightharpoons10\:\mathrm{m}$ below the top contact) with a diverse fossil assemblage. These assemblages indicate a neritic environment existed during or shortl y after the early Eocene (after ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{\:Ma})$ ), and the glauconitic laye r shows that rapid subsidence at the site occurred during the middl e Eocene.  

At Site U1510 on the southern Lord Howe Rise, Pleistocene t o lower Eocene ooze and chalk with cherty layers and volcanic detritus contain three unconformities. A hiatus occurs between the middle Pliocene and late Miocene ${\sim}4.4~\mathrm{My}$ duration), and a secon d hiatus occurs between the late Miocene and middle Miocene (5.2 5 My duration). A third hiatus separates the early Miocene from th e late Eocene with a duration of ${\sim}17.5~\mathrm{My}.$ . Benthic foraminifer an d ostracod assemblages indicate a lower or middle bathyal depositional environment at Site U1510 (present water depth is $1238\;\mathrm{m})$ since the early Eocene; however, the upper ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ of the Eocen e section $(41-37\,\mathrm{\OmegaMa})$ contains microfossils and large $\left({<}4\ \mathsf{c m}\right)$ bioclasts transported from much shallower water (neritic), and reworked fossils of early and middle Eocene age are present. In thi s anomalous interval, sighted ostracods are common, as well as shallow-water $\left(<50\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ benthic foraminifers, and nannofossils indicate  a nearby neritic environment. The base of the Miocene sequenc e $(\sim\!20\,\mathrm{{Ma})}$ does not contain evidence for nearby shallow water.  

Site U1510 is ${\sim}80~\mathrm{km}$ from Site 592, where the present wate r depth is $1088\,\mathrm{m}$ and an unconformity separates lower Miocene (23– $19\;\mathrm{Ma},$ ) chalk from lower Oligocene $(33{-}32\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) ooze. Microfossil s indicate a lower or middle bathyal environment since the Eocene a t Site 592, but the Oligocene contains several layers of coarse (1– 4 cm) mollusk (Ostrea) fragments consistent with findings at Sit e U1510 of material redeposited from shallow water in the unit jus t beneath the regional unconformity.  

The Eocene–Oligocene uplift history at Site U1510 has som e similarity with that of the western margin of Reinga Basin (Wanganella Ridge; West Norfolk Ridge), which is on the opposite side o f New Caledonia Trough (Figure F14). Bioclastic limestone dredge d from $\sim\!1750\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth (Reinga Basin Dredge TAN1312-d19; Wanganella Scarp; Bache et al., 2014b) contains neritic ( ${<}100\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth) benthic foraminifers with a depositional age of 36–3 0 Ma, and the same samples contain reworked Eocene $(43{-}38\ \mathrm{Ma})$ planktic species (Browne et al., 2016; Sutherland et al., 2017).  

At Site U1508 ( $1609\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth) on the northeast margin o f Reinga Basin, biostratigraphy reveals significant hiatuses in sedimentation at 33–26 and $23–18\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . The upper Oligocene unit between these unconformities contains volcaniclastic detritus and  a concentration of shallow-water ostracods and benthic foraminifers, as well as a palynoflora that indicates nearby land. Benthic foraminifers indicate a middle to lower bathyal $600{-}2000\ \mathrm{m}$ water depth ) environment of deposition for upper Oligocene strata, so the abundant neritic and terrestrial fossils were transported into deeper water.  Seismic  reflection  interpretation  reveals  an  extensive  fla t angular unconformity that truncates folded strata immediately eas t of Site U1508 (Figure F14) that may have been the source of neriti c and terrestrial fossils. Late Oligocene rocks containing terrestria l fossils are rare in New Zealand, so the find has biogeographic significance (Mildenhall, 2014).  

It is clear from these combined observations (Figure F12) tha t Lord Howe Rise, West Norfolk and Wanganella Ridges, and th e northeastern margin of Reinga Basin experienced Cenozoic uplift t o near or above sea level and then substantial $(>\!1\ensuremath{\mathrm{~km}})$ subsidence. However, the timing of uplift and subsidence varies between th e northern and southern sites. The northern Lord Howe Rise at Sit e U1506 was at sea level at (or after) $50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ and subsided to uppe r bathyal depths $(200{-}600\ \mathrm{m})$ by $45\ \mathrm{Ma}$ and then to lower bathya l depths $(1000{-}2000\ \mathrm{m})$ by $25\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . In contrast, the southern Lor d Howe Rise and West Norfolk and Wanganella Ridges rose to nea r sea level during 41–30 Ma and subsided back to lower bathya l depths by $23{-}19\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . The northeastern margin of Reinga Basin contains evidence for a similar late Eocene to Oligocene uplift event. Al l sites contain evidence for local volcanic activity of Eocene to Miocene age.  

# New Caledonia Trough  

New Caledonia Trough underwent substantial vertical motion s during the Paleogene. At Site U1507, the basal sediments drille d show that lower bathyal to abyssal depths were established by 4 1 Ma. Extrapolation of sedimentation rates using seismic reflectio n data to the base of the sedimentary fill suggests a Paleogene age fo r the basin (Figure F14). The apparent lack of Cretaceous sedimen t suggests an elevation near or above sea level when the basin starte d to form. Either the region was previously covered in Cretaceou s sediment that was eroded before basin formation, or older sedimen t was never deposited (e.g., it corresponded to a Late Cretaceous island or sediment-starved basin).  

At Site U1509 in the southern New Caledonia Trough (Figur e F14), Paleogene tectonic movements are overprinted on a Cretaceous sedimentary basin that can be traced with seismic reflectio n data into Fairway Basin to the north and Taranaki Basin to the sout h (Collot et al., 2009). Pleistocene to Oligocene ooze and chalk contain lower bathyal to abyssal $>\!1000\;\mathrm{m},$ , probably ${>}2000\ \mathrm{m})$ ) benthi c foraminifer assemblages consistent with water depths similar to th e present $(2911\,\textrm{m})$ . Lower bathyal $(1000{-}2000\ \mathrm{m})$ Eocene assemblages indicate slightly shallower conditions than the present bu t with some uncertainty. Paleocene and Cretaceous middle to lowe r bathyal $\left(600{-}2000\,\mathrm{m}\right)$ ) assemblages indicate a most likely paleowate r depth of ${\sim}1000\mathrm{~m~}$ . Cretaceous claystones contain abundant plan t fragments and fern spores that indicate a nearby shoreline. Th e combined data suggest ${\sim}2000\ \mathrm{m}$ of subsidence at Site U1509, wit h most of it being accomplished during $60{-}45\ \mathrm{Ma}$ .  

# Volcanic history  

At Site U1506 on the northern Lord Howe Rise, basalt flow s have a possible age of ${\sim}50$ Ma based on fossils found in a Neptunia n dike but could also be older (radiometric dating of basalt is in progress). Small basaltic cones are associated with the regional Eocen e unconformity elsewhere on the northern Lord Howe Rise (Dadd e t al., 2011). Preliminary X-ray fluorescence analysis shows volcani c rocks at Site U1506 to be tholeiitic, which is consistent with th e mildly alkaline tholeiitic trend of other analyses from the norther n Lord Howe Rise (Mortimer et al., 2017).  

At Site U1510 on the southern Lord Howe Rise, Eocene (48–3 5 Ma) strata contain volcaniclastic layers. Based on interpretation o f seismic reflection and bathymetric data, the strata have clear synvolcanic stratigraphic relationships with nearby volcanic cones. A t Site 592, ${\sim}80~\mathrm{km}$ from Site U1510 (Figure F4), green and brow n laminations in the upper Eocene to lower Oligocene $(37-32\,\mathrm{\ma})$ ooze and chalk are interpreted to be volcaniclastic (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1986a). At DSDP Site 593 on Challenger Plateau, uppe r Eocene $(37{-}34\ \mathrm{Ma})$ volcaniclastic turbidites contain coarser material than that found at Site 592 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1986b). Near Site U1509, which is east of Site U1510 on the margin of Lor d Howe Rise with New Caledonia Trough, samples of mildly alkalin e basalt dredged from the seabed yield ages of $30{-}28\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Mortime r et al., 2017).  

At Site U1507 in New Caledonia Trough, a thick $\left(285\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ unit o f Eocene–Miocene $(36{-}20\ \mathrm{Ma})$ clayey chalk contains volcaniclasti c turbidites. Site U1507 is adjacent to one of a series of large submerged volcanoes exposed just west of the crest of Norfolk Ridge. Seabed dredging from the southern end of this volcanic chain recovered a shoshonite that is interpreted to be subduction-relate d (but not typical) and has an age of $26\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Mortimer et al., 2007). A t the northern end of d’Entrecasteaux Ridge, which is the structural extension of Norfolk Ridge north of New Caledonia (i.e., alon g strike), Mortimer et al. (2014) reported ages of $38{-}32\;\mathrm{Ma}$ from volcanic rocks with a clear subduction signature. Our preliminary interpretation is that the volcaniclastic sequence at Site U150 7 records the onset of subduction-related volcanism at that location, but additional geochemical work is required.  

At Site U1508 in Reinga Basin, volcaniclastic material is found i n the upper Oligocene to middle Miocene $(26-15\,\mathrm{Ma})$ . Extensive geochemical  work  on  correlative  rocks  exposed  onshore  nearb y (Northland region of northern New Zealand) shows this volcani c phase was subduction-related (Booden et al., 2011). Ages of volcanic rocks in Northland range from 23 to 11 Ma with a general tren d of younger ages to the southeast (Hayward et al., 2001). Seismi c stratigraphic analysis of the offshore region west of Northland ha s identified many volcanic centers and ties to boreholes that confir m the arc was active there during the interval 23–16 Ma (Herzer, 1995). Results from Site U1508 are consistent with this previou s work, but our preliminary analysis suggests the onset of volcanis m may be slightly older $\left(26\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ ). This difference may be because Sit e U1508 is north of all previous sites, or it may be that the record w e sampled is more complete.  

# Tectonic synthesis  

The modern Pacific Ring of Fire was mostly created during th e Eocene when subduction initiated throughout the western Pacific. In the northwest Pacific, volcanic activity associated with the ne w subduction system started at ${\sim}52\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Arculus et al., 2015b), and th e associated change in Pacific plate motion was complete by ${\sim}44{-}43$ Ma (Sharp and Clague, 2006). Expedition 371 provides new an d precise age constraints on the deformation, uplift, and volcanic histories in the southwest Pacific (Figure F12) and hence broadens ou r understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of various type s of tectonic activity during a large-scale subduction initiation event.  

The first signs of tectonic change in the southwest Pacific occu r at about the same time as they do in the northwest Pacific. Seafloo r spreading ended in the Tasman Sea at ${\sim}52\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Gaina et al., 1998), and dolerite dikes and sills in oceanic crust now exposed in Ne w Caledonia (Poya terrane) have radiometric ages that cluster at $54\pm$ $5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Cluzel et al., 2017). Boninites with ages of $55{-}50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ intrud e ultramafic rocks now exposed in New Caledonia (Cluzel et al., 2016). In the Tonga fore arc, plagiogranites associated with ultramafic rocks have ages of $51{-}50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Meffre et al., 2012).  

Blueschist rocks in New Caledonia provide direct evidence fo r high-pressure, low-temperature metamorphism that is likely associated with convergence and subduction initiation. The onset o f blueschist metamorphism in New Caledonia is constrained by detrital zircons and prograde mica growth to be during $55{-}50\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Pirard and Spandler, 2017; Vitale Brovarone et al., 2018). Zirco n growth dates peak metamorphism at ${\sim}44\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Spandler et al., 2005), and thermochronology reveals a subsequent phase of rapid exhumation and cooling that mostly terminated by ${\sim}34$ Ma (Baldwin e t al., 2007). Exhumation was associated with emplacement of th e Poya and ultramafic nappes (Aitchison et al., 1995) and depositio n of a thick flysch sequence that is now exposed on the southwes t coast of New Caledonia (Maurizot, 2011; Cluzel et al., 2012; Dallanave et al., 2018).  

Our observations demonstrate that paleogeography of the earl y Eocene and older times cannot easily be inferred from looking a t the present physiography of northern Zealandia. Subduction initiation in the southwest Pacific changed the stress and thermal state, modified the crustal and lithospheric structure, and hence cause d major changes in water depth.  

Evidence from Site U1507 suggests the northern New Caledoni a Trough formed during the early stages of Paleogene tectonic chang e (before $44\mathrm{\Ma}$ ). Paleowater depth estimates from Site U1509 ar e consistent with evidence for a drowned shelf in Taranaki Basi n (Sutherland et al., 2010; Baur et al., 2014) and indicate that the Cretaceous Fairway-Aotea-Taranaki Basin (Collot et al., 2009) was dramatically deepened $\left(\sim\!2000\textrm{m}\right)$ at a similar time (i.e., early Eocene, but additional detailed stratigraphy is required in the southern region) to form southern New Caledonia Trough.  

The northern Lord Howe Rise at Site U1506 rose to sea level a t ${\sim}50$ Ma and subsided back to upper bathyal depths $(200{-}600\,\mathrm{m})$ b y $45\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . In contrast, the southern Lord Howe Rise near Site U151 0 experienced its transient uplift peak at ${\sim}40{-}30\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . A pulse of convergent plate failure, named the TECTA event by Sutherland et al. (2017), took place across the southern part of the region (Tasma n Abyssal Plain, Lord Howe Rise, New Caledonia Trough, and Reing a Basin) and is constrained by our observations to have occurre d during ${\sim}45{-}35\ \mathrm{Ma}$ .  

The volcanic history requires further analysis, but a preliminar y interpretation is that uplift of Lord Howe Rise was associated with  a prolonged phase of intraplate volcanism. A pulse of subduction-related volcanism appears to have migrated southward from d’Entrecasteaux Ridge to Norfolk Ridge to Northland at 38–32, 36–20, an d $26{-}15\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively. The oldest subduction-related rocks in th e Tonga fore arc are dated at $48\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Meffre et al., 2012).  

Induced subduction initiation models predict a phase of convergent plate failure as the new slab starts to form (Gurnis et al., 2004), whereas spontaneous subduction models predict tensile stresse s and back-arc opening early in the initiation process (Stern, 2004). I n the context of western Pacific subduction initiation and plate motion change, events initiated at ${\sim}53{-}50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , as evidenced by the ag e of the Emperor-Hawaii bend (Sharp and Clague, 2006) and the onset of volcanism in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction syste m (Ishizuka et al., 2011; Arculus et al., 2015b). Further, the nature o f faulting and volcanic products in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana system reveals tensile stress and seafloor spreading at a very early stage (53– $50\;\mathrm{Ma},$ ); hence, a spontaneous subduction initiation model is implicated (Arculus et al., 2015b), possibly caused by instability associated with juxtaposition of a buoyant relic arc against the old Pacifi c oceanic plate by a weak fault (Leng and Gurnis, 2015). Subductio n initiation in the northwest Pacific and Pacific plate motion chang e was completed by ${\sim}44{-}43\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Sharp and Clague, 2006).  

Magnetic anomalies show that Tasman Sea spreading ended a t ${\sim}52\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , and a new phase of rapid seafloor spreading started sout h of Australia and New Zealand at ${\sim}43$ Ma to create the south Tasma n Sea ocean crust (Sutherland, 1995; Gaina et al., 1998; Cande an d Stock, 2004). Therefore, regional changes in plate motion can b e linked to the observations of uplift, deformation, and volcanism described above. A clear temporal relationship exists between event s in the northwest Pacific, the change in direction of the Pacific plat e in a hotspot reference frame, and the sequence of events in th e southwest Pacific.  

Formation of the northern New Caledonia Trough was associated with the early phase of Cenozoic tectonic activity in the southwest Pacific and may be evidence for spontaneous subductio n initiation in the north. However, no published subduction initiatio n model involves large-scale removal of crust and long-term basi n formation. The onset of volcanism at $\mathord{\sim}38$ Ma at Site U1507 is muc h later than the earliest signs of tectonic activity $(\sim\!53\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ). Transien t vertical movements of Lord Howe Rise are not predicted by existin g models and require a physical explanation. Convergent deformatio n in the southern part of the Tasman Frontier suggests an induce d subduction initiation model (Sutherland et al., 2017), but deformation does not occur until $45{-}35\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . The spatial and temporal relationships we observed suggest it is not appropriate to simplify th e subduction initiation processes in 2-D. Future work will focus o n the development of a new class of subduction initiation geodynami c model that can fit all observations and will likely include 3-D considerations. For the first time, we have sufficient observations t o constrain such a model.  

# Paleoceanography and climate  

# Quaternary sediment cycles and bryozoan fossils  

Two sites provided Quaternary records amenable for paleoceanographic study. The upper section of Site U1510 on the southern Lord Howe Rise was recovered using APC coring in two hole s that can be spliced together to form a $44.5\mathrm{~m~}$ continuous sectio n spanning most of the late Pleistocene. The section contains calcareous ooze with obvious cycles in physical properties, such as colo r and grain size. Site U1508 northwest of northern New Zealand ha s a nearly $100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick Pleistocene section. Although rotary cored, layers with macroscopic fragments of bryozoans and other shallowwater organisms present an intriguing and unusual find. The site i s at a “temperate carbonate” margin (Nelson and Hancock, 1984) tha t provides an opportunity to study coupling between sedimentolog y and large-amplitude variations in sea level.  

# Late Miocene to early Pliocene biogenic bloom  

Four sites recovered carbonate-rich sediment in which to asses s the so-called late Miocene–early Pliocene biogenic bloom (Dicken s and Owen, 1999). This phenomenon, which is recognized from sediment sections at multiple ocean drilling sites, can be described a s follows: beneath zones of surface water divergence and upwelling i n the Indian and Pacific Oceans, accumulation rates of biogenic components to the seafloor increased significantly between about 8 an d $3\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , suggesting significantly increased primary productivity an d expansion of the oxygen minimum zone.  

Similar to previously drilled DSDP sites from the Tasman Sea, carbonate accumulation rates rose dramatically at northern Site s U1506 and U1507 from 8 to $3\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . These records provide an excellent opportunity to assess variations in global nutrient cycling an d look into a plausible explanation for this event. However, a condensed interval marks the stratigraphic records at southern Site s U1509 and U1510 and may indicate underlying changes in deep-water flow during the late Miocene and early Pliocene.  

# Biogenic silica in the Eocene to Oligocene interval  

Previous drilling in the Tasman Sea recovered very little sediment deposited between the middle Eocene and middle Oligocene, which led to an idea of a regional unconformity caused by intensification of deep-water currents (Kennett et al., 1975; Edwards, 1973, 1975).  

We recovered apparently complete Oligocene sections at Site s U1507 and U1509 in New Caledonia Trough, with all late Eocen e and Oligocene calcareous biozones and most polarity chrons identified at the first site. However, a hiatus of variable duration wa s found at shallow sites on Lord Howe Rise between the upper Eocen e and upper Oligocene at Site U1508 and between the upper Eocen e and middle Miocene at Site U1510. Notably, the middle Eocen e through lower Oligocene interval, where found, including at Sit e U1511 on the Tasman Abyssal Plain, contains biosilica or chert. Postexpedition effort might be placed on understanding whethe r these observations support unusual oceanography or a different paleogeography and how silica deposition here compares with othe r global locations.  

# Regional Paleogene climate records  

Several Paleogene sediment sections exposed in New Zealan d and New Caledonia have become the focus of paleoclimate researc h because, once placed onto accurate age models, lithologic variation s at key sites, such as Mead Stream in South Island, correspond to established changes in global climate (e.g., Dallanave et al., 2015). Several Expedition 371 sites contain lithostratigraphic records wher e changes in sediment composition appear to correlate with thos e now uplifted on land, particularly Site U1508 in Reinga Basin.  

# Early Paleogene greenhouse world and hyperthermals  

The late Paleocene through early Eocene greenhouse worl d started to warm in the late Paleocene, culminating in the warmes t part of the Cenozoic $(53{-}49\,\mathrm{\;Ma})$ , referred to as the EECO. Thi s long-term evolution was punctuated by short, extreme warmin g events called hyperthermals. The PETM $^{'}{\sim}55.5\ \mathrm{Ma})$ was the mos t extreme of these hyperthermals. Additional transient warmin g events include the MECO $\mathbf{\left<\sim40\Ma\right>}$ ).  

These events generally were not recovered at most sites durin g Expedition 371. At Sites U1507 and U1508, poorly recovered horizons (probably rich in chert) may mark the MECO. Sites U1508 an d U1510 terminated near the top of the lower Eocene because of operational time restraints. At Site U1509, almost the entire early Eocene  appears  to  have  slumped  on  a  surface  approximatel y coincident with the PETM. It is possible that lithologic changes associated with warm events, such as clay-rich horizons and surrounding chert, make them difficult to recover in deep holes. Despite the above difficulties, apparently complete MECO an d EECO intervals were recovered from the Tasman Abyssal Plain a t Site U1511. However, these intervals at Site U1511 lack carbonat e constituents  and  were  dated  using  radiolarians  and  paleomagnetism.  

# Paleocene and Maastrichtian claystones  

Paleogene calcareous green claystone was found at Sites U150 9 and U1511. At the former site, coring also recovered dark brow n Maastrichtian claystone. Considering exposed sections on land an d past drill sites in the region, Paleogene clays accumulated over  a widespread area of Zealandia (Andrews et al., 1975). At Site U150 9 and other locations, these clays contain modest organic carbon, whereas the Paleocene at Site U1511 yields slightly higher carbonat e content than in the rest of the succession.  

# Sediment diagenesis and pore fluids Sediment compaction and ooze–chalk transition  

Calcareous ooze, dominantly comprising microscopic calcit e shells, blankets a large area of the modern seafloor above the CCD. With time and burial, this ooze can become compacted and altere d to chalk and ultimately limestone. Reduction in porosity (Figur e F15) and lithification over the transition zone from ooze to chal k has long fascinated the marine geoscience community because it affects the velocity of seismic waves, the recovery of core, and the nature of calcareous components. Analysis of previous DSDP drillin g emphasized the complex nature of the ooze–chalk transition in th e Tasman Sea. Cores and data from Expedition 371 provide new empirical data to quantify relationships between sediment composition, burial history, compaction, and diagenesis and may help clarif y our understanding of the underlying processes. The ooze–chal k transition was found at approximately 235, 290, 200, 55, and $150\;\mathrm{m}$ at Sites U1506, U1507, U1508, U1509, and U1510, respectively. Th e very shallow transition in middle Miocene sediment at Site U150 9 probably reflects missing overburden that was lost by slumping. The range in depths at the other sites may reflect differences in age, compaction, and sediment composition.  

# Thermogenic gas  

Routine headspace gas sampling revealed significant concentrations of light hydrocarbon gases in deep sediments at two locations.  

![](images/62c7e9ab2b8536fdeb1eb6618557a598538c261bca357dbe272c3f73a1e5ca9d.jpg)  
Figure F15. Summary of porosity data collected during Expedition 371.  

Methane concentrations began to increase below ${\sim}500\,\mathrm{~m~}$ in th e middle Eocene nannofossil chalk at Site U1508 and below ${\sim}400\,\mathrm{m}$ i n the Eocene calcareous claystone at Site U1509. At both locations, ethane and propane were also detected, although the $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratio di d not drop below 100. The suites of hydrocarbons measured were no t classified as “anomalous” but do suggest burial of strata containin g organic carbon and thermogenic hydrocarbon production in Reing a Basin and the southern New Caledonia Trough.  

# Deep anaerobic oxidation of methane  

Upward-migrating gas at Sites U1508 and U1509 (above) impacts pore water chemistry significantly. At both sites, dissolve d sulfate concentrations steadily decrease almost linearly from nea r seawater values at some shallow depth to zero at the depth wher e methane concentrations begin to rise. These deep SMT depths, ${\sim}500\,\mathrm{m}$ at Site U1508 and ${\sim}400\,\mathrm{m}$ at Site U1509, probably represen t locations of AOM. Abundant pyrite is found in sediment near th e SMTs, and dissolved Ba concentrations rise steeply beneath th e SMTs. Interestingly, at Site U1508, sulfate concentrations begin decreasing at ${\sim}290~\mathrm{m}$ rather than at the seafloor, possibly because o f major changes in the porosity of sediment. In any case, these tw o Expedition 371 sites, along with a few other sites recently drille d elsewhere, significantly expand the subbottom depth range ove r which AOM can occur.  

# Iron oxide and copper mineralization  

Vivid red-orange (2.5YR 5/6) claystone and native copper surrounded by dark green halos were found in multiple intervals o f lower Eocene sediment at Site U1511. The striking color of the claystone comes from hematite, as determined from rock magneti c properties. Although the thickest and most striking horizon approximately coincides with the EECO (see above), both observations and theoretical arguments suggest the unusual mineralogy i s not primary but the product of alteration. Presumably, saline fluid s lacking dissolved oxygen and sulfur but carrying dissolved iron an d copper precipitated minerals as they passed through the sediment, perhaps along fractures. Notably, seismic profiles show that Eocen e and older strata at the site are folded and faulted. Native copper ha s been described at previous scientific drill sites (Dickens et al., 1995), and a commonality seems to be proximal folding and faulting.  

# An advance in pore water collection method  

Coring with the APC system in multiple holes and the construction of spliced records has become a common approach for drillin g expeditions with paleoceanography or biogeochemistry objectives. To achieve the Expedition 371 goals, which required deep drillin g (in a time window shortened by weather, technical problems, and  a medical emergency), the sedimentary records at most sites were recovered mostly in one hole, often using the RCB system. Althoug h not ideal, good first-order sedimentary records and pore water profiles were generated at most sites. Notably, at sites where interval s were cored using both the XCB and RCB methods, the latter generally gave better quality cores in a shorter time period. To obtain reasonably good and detailed pore water profiles with minimal impac t to the sedimentary record, Rhizon samples were taken at some site s and squeeze samples were taken from the bases of Sections 1, 6, o r both. Such sampling generally avoids splice intervals (i.e., the cor e gaps created by IW sampling fall into “off-splice” intervals).  

# Regional stratigraphy  

During Expedition 371, the sedimentary section was retrieved a t six sites (Table T1) in a vast remote region (Figure F2). At five sites , we sampled nannofossil and foraminiferal ooze and chalk that contained volcanic or volcaniclastic intervals with variable clay conten t (Figure F10). The Paleocene and Cretaceous sections are generall y clay rich or predominantly claystone. At the final site (U1511), a sequence of abyssal clay and diatomite was recovered with only mino r carbonate. The ages at the base of the deepest hole at each site varied from Eocene to Cretaceous, and sedimentation rates were moderate to high $(5{-}20~\mathrm{\m/My})$ for the lower bathyal and abyssa l environments in which most sediments accumulated (Figures F11, F16). Our new results provide the first substantial basis for definition of formal lithostratigraphic units that can be mapped across  a substantial part of northern Zealandia and related to onshore regions of New Caledonia and New Zealand, which will be the subjec t of future work. Rather than tectonic objectives, future Zealandi a drilling can target expanded sections, and so on. For example, Sit e U1510 is located where the Neogene section pinches out and  a much more expanded section could be drilled.
