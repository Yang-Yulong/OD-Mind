# Abstract  

Volcanic arcs are the surface expression of magmatic system s that result from subduction of mostly oceanic lithosphere at convergent plate boundaries. Arcs with a submarine component includ e intraoceanic arcs and island arcs that span almost $22,000~\mathrm{km}$ o n Earth’s surface, and the vast majority of them are located in the Pacific region. Hydrothermal systems hosted by submarine arc volcanoes commonly contain a large component of magmatic fluid. Thi s magmatic-hydrothermal signature, coupled with the shallow wate r depths of arc volcanoes and their high volatile contents, strongly influences the chemistry of the fluids and resulting mineralizatio n and likely has important consequences for the biota associated wit h these systems. The high metal content and very acidic fluids i n these hydrothermal systems are thought to be important analogs t o numerous porphyry copper and epithermal gold deposits mined today on land.  

During International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 376 (5 May–5 July 2018), a series of five sites was drilled o n Brothers volcano in the Kermadec arc. The expedition was designe d to provide the missing link (i.e., the third dimension) in our understanding of hydrothermal activity and mineral deposit formation a t submarine arc volcanoes and the relationship between the discharge of magmatic fluids and the deep biosphere. Brothers volcan o hosts two active and distinct hydrothermal systems: one is seawate r influenced and the other is affected by magmatic fluids (largel y gases). In total, $222.4\;\mathrm{m}$ of volcaniclastics and lavas were recovere d from the five sites drilled, which include Sites U1527 and U1530 i n the Northwest (NW) Caldera seawater-influenced hydrotherma l field; Sites U1528 and U1531 in the magmatic fluid-influenced hydrothermal fields of the Upper and Lower Cones, respectively; an d Site U1529, located within an area of low crustal magnetization tha t marks the West (W) Caldera upflow zone on the caldera floor. Downhole logging and borehole fluid sampling were completed a t two sites, and two tests of a prototype turbine-driven coring syste m (designed by the Center for Deep Earth Exploration [CDEX] a t Japan  Agency  for  Marine-Earth  Science  and  Technolog y [JAMSTEC]) for drilling and coring hard rocks were conducted.  

Core recovered from all five sites consists of dacitic volcaniclastics and lava flows with only limited chemical variability relative t o the overall range in composition of dacites in the Kermadec arc. Pervasive alteration with complex and variable mineral assemblage s attest to a highly dynamic hydrothermal system. The upper parts o f several drill holes at the NW Caldera hydrothermal field are characterized by secondary mineral assemblages of goethite $+\mathrm{\opal\,+\,zeo-}$ lites that result from low-temperature $(<\!150^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ reaction of roc k with seawater. At depth, NW Caldera Site U1527 exhibits a highe r temperature $({\sim}250^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ secondary mineral assemblage dominated b y chlorite $^+$ quartz $^+$ illite $^+$ pyrite. An older mineral assemblag e dominated by diaspore $^+$ quartz $^+$ pyrophyllite $^+$ rutile at the bottom of Hole U1530A is indicative of acidic fluids with temperature s of ${\sim}230^{\circ}{-}320^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . In contrast, the alteration assemblage at Sit e U1528 on the Upper Cone is dominated by illite $^+$ natroalunite $^+$ pyrophyllite $^+$ quartz $^+$ opal $^+$ pyrite, which attests to high-temperature reaction of rocks with acid-sulfate fluids derived from degassed magmatic volatiles and the disproportionation of magmati c $S O_{2}$ . These intensely altered rocks exhibit extreme depletion of major cation oxides, such as MgO, $\mathrm{K_{2}O},$ CaO, MnO, and $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}.$ . Furthermore, very acidic (as low as $\mathsf{p H}\,1.8)$ , relatively hot $(\le\!236^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ fluids collected at 160, 279, and 313 meters below seafloor in Hol e  

U1528D have chemical compositions indicative of magmatic gas input. In addition, preliminary fluid inclusion data provide evidenc e for involvement of two distinct fluids: phase-separated (modified ) seawater and a ${\sim}360^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ hypersaline brine, which alters the volcani c rock and potentially transports metals in the system.  

The material and data recovered during Expedition 376 provid e new stratigraphic, lithologic, and geochemical constraints on th e development and evolution of Brothers volcano and its hydrothermal systems. Insights into the consequences of the different types o f fluid–rock reactions for the microbiological ecosystem elucidate d by drilling at Brothers volcano await shore-based studies.  

# Introduction  

Magmatic systems that derive from subduction of mainly oceanic lithosphere at convergent plate boundaries become manifest i n volcanic arcs at the surface. Those arcs that contain a submarin e component include intraoceanic arcs and island arcs, which span almost $22,000~\mathrm{km}$ on Earth’s surface, the vast majority of which ar e located in the Pacific region (de Ronde et al., 2003). It is estimate d that all intraoceanic arcs combined may contribute hydrotherma l emissions equal to $\sim\!10\%$ of that from mid-ocean ridges (MORs ) (Baker et al., 2008).  

Hydrothermal activity associated with these submarine arc volcanoes is commonly dominated by discharge of magmatic volatile s

in contrast to MOR systems that are governed by seawater circulation through basaltic oceanic crust. Submarine arc magmatic-hydrothermal  systems  are  driven  by  crystallization  of  magma s produced by mantle melting fluxed by volatiles released from th e subducting slab. These magmas are enriched by an order of magnitude in volatiles compared with MOR basalts (e.g., Wallace, 2005; Plank et al., 2013). Degassing of these arc magmas gives rise to extraordinary phenomena, such as the discharge of liquid $C O_{2}$ (Lupton et al., 2006) and the formation of liquid “lakes” of sulfur on th e seafloor (de Ronde et al., 2015). Although intraoceanic arcs ar e some of the most hostile environments for life because of the exceptionally high concentrations of toxic metals and metalloids in ver y acidic, gas-rich, high-temperature fluids, diverse animal and microbial communities are commonly observed (e.g., Clark and O’Shea, 2001; Takai et al., 2009).  

The Kermadec segment of the Kermadec-Tonga intraoceani c arc (Figure F1) is host to ${\sim}32$ large volcanoes, $80\%$ of which are hydrothermally active, making it the most active arc in the world. Th e magmatic-hydrothermal signatures, including high concentration s of sulfur and carbon species gases and high iron contents, couple d with the shallow depths of venting ${\sim}1800{-}120$ meters below se a level [mbsl]) of these volcanoes, heavily influence the chemistry o f the discharging fluids and the minerals that precipitate from thes e fluids and have important consequences for the biota associate d with these systems. Given the high metal contents and very acidi c fluids, these hydrothermal systems are also considered to serve a s important submarine analogs to many of the porphyry copper an d epithermal gold deposits exploited on land today.  

Brothers volcano on the Kermadec arc is such a system and ha s been the focus of a continuing series of studies. An International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) workshop (Lisbon, Novembe r 2012; http://www.ecord.org/science/magellanplus) identifie d Brothers volcano as the top candidate worldwide for arc volcan o drilling. Hence, Expedition 376 was designed to provide the missin g link (i.e., the third dimension) in our understanding of mineral deposit formation along arcs, the subseafloor architecture of thes e volcanoes and their related permeability, and the relationship between the discharge of magmatic fluids and the deep biosphere.  

# Geological setting  

The Kermadec-Tonga arc northeast of New Zealand (Figure F1 ) is one of the longest contiguous intraoceanic arcs in the world. More than 60 volcanoes of varying sizes occur along the arc—th e vast majority of which are submarine—with more than half occurring in the Kermadec sector (de Ronde et al., 2003, 2007). Volcani c rocks along the Kermadec arc range in composition from basalt t o rhyodacite. Trace element and isotopic data indicate significan t magma source heterogeneity both along and across the arc as a result of variable subduction of continent-derived sediments, pelagi c sediments, and oceanic crust and/or interaction with continental crust (e.g., Gamble and Wright, 1995; Gamble et al., 1996; Haase e t al., 2002; Timm et al., 2012, 2013, 2014).  

Brothers volcano (Figure F2) is one of three caldera volcanoe s included in 13 major volcanic edifices that form the active Kermadec volcanic arc front between $37^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ and $34^{\circ}50^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ (Wright, 1997; Wright and Gamble, 1999). Brothers volcano is part of a ${\sim}35~\mathrm{km}$ long and $15\,\mathrm{km}$ wide predominantly silicic volcanic complex that i s dissected by basement fractures and associated dike-controlle d ridges that are $1{-}1.5~\mathrm{km}$ wide and rise $400{-}500\ \mathrm{m}$ above the seafloor. These structures strike predominantly $55^{\circ}$ to $65^{\circ}$ , although  a

conjugate set of faults is observed subparallel to the elongate d Brothers volcano edifice and caldera (Figure F2). These orientation s are consistent with Havre Trough rifting (e.g., Wright et al., 1996; Deltiel et al., 2002; Ruellen et al., 2003) and indicate first-order extensional tectonic control on Brothers volcano. The base of Brothers volcano rises from a water depth of ${\sim}2200\mathrm{~m~}$ to a continuou s caldera rim at $1540\ \mathrm{m},$ although locally the northwestern rim (o r Upper Caldera wall) shoals to $1320\;\mathrm{m}$ . The caldera floor has a basa l diameter of $3{-}3.5\;\mathrm{km}$ , reaches a water depth of $1850\;\mathrm{m},$ and is surrounded by $290{-}530\ \mathrm{m}$ high walls. An elongated northeast–southwest postcollapse cone $1.5{-}2~\mathrm{km}$ wide $\times~350~\mathrm{m}$ high), the Uppe r Cone, occurs within the caldera, and a satellite cone (Lower Cone ) appears on its northeastern flank (Figure F3A, F3B). The Uppe r Cone in part coalesces with the southern caldera wall and shoals t o $1220\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ (de Ronde et al., 2005).  

Brothers volcano represents a window into the complicated hydrothermal systems found at submarine arc volcanoes, which display a range of geological and structural settings and vent flui d chemistry, as well as animals and microbes as yet undiscovered a t any other site on the seafloor. Six hydrothermal fields have bee n identified in or on the walls of the caldera at Brothers volcano (Figures F2, F4). Five of these fields are presently active (the Upper Caldera, Northwest [NW] Caldera, West [W] Caldera, Upper Cone, and Lower Cone sites), whereas the Southeast (SE) Caldera site i s currently inactive, or at least it does not contribute to vent plume s measured above the seafloor (Baker et al., 2012). Extensive autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) mapping of the caldera (de Rond e et al., 2012; Embley et al., 2012) has shown that these hydrothermal fields, with the exception of the Lower Cone site, are closely correlated to areas of low crustal magnetization that are consisten t with zones of hydrothermal upflow (Figure F5) (Caratori Tontini e t al., 2012a, 2012b; Gruen et al., 2012).  

The five active fields exhibit two different types of hydrotherma l activity. Type I hydrothermal systems are characterized by hightemperature $(\le\!320^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ venting of relatively gas-poor, moderatel y acidic fluids at the W, NW, and Upper Caldera sites, where $\mathrm{Cu-Au-}$ rich sulfide chimneys are common. Type II hydrothermal fields ar e characterized by lower temperature $(\Omega120^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ venting of gassy, ver y low pH (to 1.9) fluids at the summits of the Upper and Lower Con e sites, where native sulfur chimneys and extensive Fe oxyhydroxid e crusts occur (de Ronde et al., 2005, 2011). Time-series studies of hydrothermal plumes above the four most active sites (i.e., Upper Caldera, NW Caldera, and the Upper and Lower Cone sites) show tha t the cone sites expelled fluids of widely differing compositions between 1999 and 2018, with large variations in dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ , particulate Cu, dissolved Fe, and Fe/Mn values (Humphris et al., 2018). B y contrast, the composition of chronic plumes above the NW Calder a site (the Upper Caldera site was discovered only in 2017), althoug h chemically distinct from the other hydrothermal vent sites, has no t changed over the same interval (de Ronde et al., 2005; Humphris e t al., 2018).  

In 2005, Neptune Minerals Inc. drilled a number of shallo w holes (to 14.8 meters below seafloor [mbsf]) at Brothers volcano. Sixteen holes were drilled on the slopes of the NW Caldera wall, and a single hole was drilled inside the crater atop the Upper Cone. The uppermost material of many of these holes consisted of dar k brown ooze locally containing glass sand and grit. This material wa s commonly underlain by an ${\sim}1\;\mathrm{m}$ thick zone that contained pieces o f sulfide chimney, glass grit, Fe-Si-Mn oxyhydroxides, and mixture s thereof. Typically underlying this zone were variably hydrothermally altered volcanic rocks ranging from volcanic silt and sand t o volcanic glass, gravel, breccia, and more massive volcanic rock (dacite). Alteration colors ranged from pale gray to pale green, an d stockwork veins locally cut the rocks. The one core drilled insid e the pit crater atop the Upper Cone intersected volcanic breccia, gravels, and rocks together with native sulfur to 10 mbsf.  

Microbial community development patterns associated with th e two types of hydrothermal activity at Brothers volcano have bee n explored using limited (four) samples collected from the seafloo r (Stott et al., 2008; Takai et al., 2009). Microbial community compositions obtained from chimneys at the NW Caldera site are characterized by an abundance of slightly thermophilic and hyperthermophilic chemolithoautotrophs (Takai et al., 2009), which ar e observed in typical high-temperature hydrothermal vent environments of MORs and back-arc basin systems (Nakamura and Takai, 2014). By contrast, microbial communities from the Lower Con e exhibit a diversity of bacterial lineages, with potential psychrophili c and  thermophilic  sulfur-  and  iron-oxidizing  chemolithotroph s (Stott et al., 2008) like those found in the magmatic volatile–rich hydrothermal environments of submarine arc volcanoes (Nakamur a and Takai, 2014). These intrafield differences in microbial community composition and function are thought to be associated

with the different hydrothermal fluid compositions in the two type s of hydrothermal systems. In particular, the highly variable volatil e species concentrations induced by phase separation, the variabl e mixing ratios of hydrothermal and seawater inputs, and the concomitant precipitation of mineral phases are considered crucial factors  in  the  control  of  chemosynthetic  microbial  communit y development (Takai and Nakamura, 2011; Nakamura and Takai, 2014). The common occurrence of two distinct hydrothermal microbial ecosystems within a single caldera, showing a clear nich e segregation in response to both physical and chemical differences i n the hydrothermal fluids, is currently globally unique (Flores et al., 2012; Nakamura and Takai, 2014).  

Modeling of the subseafloor hydrology at Brothers volcan o has suggested that subseafloor phase separation, inferred fro m measured temperatures and calculated end-member vent flui d chemical and isotopic compositions, can be achieved only by th e primary input of saline magmatic fluids at depth (de Ronde et al., 2011; Gruen et al., 2012, 2014). In addition, the vent systems appear to evolve over short time periods. Expulsion of magmati c heat and volatiles occurs within the first few hundred years o f magma emplacement in the form of low-salinity, vapor-rich fluid, and magmatically derived salt is temporarily trapped in the crust. This retained salt is then periodically expelled from the syste m by later convection of low- to high-temperature hydrotherma l fluid of seawater origin (Gruen et al., 2014). This model has important implications for the distribution of metals in the hydrothermal mineralization. Sulfide-complexed metals (e.g., Au) wil l preferentially ascend during the early vapor-dominated fluid discharge, whereas chloride-complexed metals (e.g., Cu, Pb, and Zn ) will be retained in the dense magmatic brine, thus potentiall y forming layers of metal sulfides with distinct zonation at dept h (Gruen et al., 2014).

The following four primary scientific objectives were outlined i n the Expedition 376 Scientific Prospectus (de Ronde et al., 2017):  

• Characterize the subvolcano, magma chamber–derived volatile phase to test model-based predictions that this is either a singlephase gas or two-phase brine-vapor;   
• Determine the subseafloor distribution of base and precious metals and metalloids and the reactions that have taken place along pathways to the seafloor;   
• Quantify the mechanisms and extent of fluid–rock interaction and consequences for mass transfer of metals and metalloids into the ocean and the role of magmatically derived carbon and sulfur species in mediating these fluxes; and   
• Assess the diversity, extent, and metabolic pathways of microbial life in an extreme, metal-toxic, acidic volcanic environment.  

The drill sites represent discharge zones of geochemically distinc t fluids that are variably affected by magmatic volatile input, allowin g us to directly address the consequences of magma degassing o n metal transport to the seafloor and its effect on the functioning o f microbial communities.  

To meet these objectives, a strategy involving two independen t drilling efforts was developed to recover cores from both shallo w $(<\!200\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ and deep $\mathrm{({\sim}200{-}800\ m b s f)}$ ) intervals. Cores with goo d recovery are required from the shallowest intervals (tens of meter s depth) to examine aspects of hydrogeology, permeability, fluid flow, and seawater entrainment and their effects on microbial community development and habitability. We will acquire these cores b y deploying the MeBo seafloor drill rig (Freudenthal and Wefer, 2007 ) from R/V Sonne at a time yet to be planned (Bach, Haase, Wefer, and de Ronde, co-Principal Investigators). This scheduled shallo w drilling allowed Expedition 376 to bypass coring in the shallowes t parts of the holes when necessary and strategically prepare the hole s for casing installations required for deep coring. The operational plan for Expedition 376 was to drill, core, and log three sites, one o n the northwest rim of the caldera, one on the western side of the caldera floor, and one atop the Upper Cone, to provide access to critical zones dominated by magma degassing and high-temperatur e hydrothermal circulation over depth ranges considered crucial i n the development of multiphase mineralizing systems.  

# Site summaries Site U1527  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1527 (proposed Site NWC-1A) is located on the rim of th e northwest caldera wall of Brothers volcano at a water depth of 146 4 m (Figure F6). Drilling targeted what was thought to be either th e margin of an older modified-seawater hydrothermal upflow zone o r a recharge zone to the currently active discharge areas several hundred meters away from either side of the drill site. A key objective o f Expedition 376 was to quantify the mechanisms and extent of fluid– rock interaction and the consequences for mass transfer of metal s into the ocean in both seawater-dominated and magmatic fluid– dominated hydrothermal systems within the caldera of Brother s volcano. Hence, the main objective of Site U1527 was to drill through the margin of the inferred upflow zone of a modified-seawater system.  

# Operations  

We conducted operations in three holes at Site U1527 (Tabl e T1). Hole U1527A is located at $34^{\circ}51.6528^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}3.2397^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $1464.2\;\mathrm{m}$ . We used the rotary core barrel (RCB) syste m in this hole to core from the seafloor to 101.4 mbsf. Recovery wa s poor $(1.27\;\mathrm{m};1.3\%)$ ). The downhole conditions encountered in Hol e U1527A determined the preparations for running a reentry system. In Hole U1527B, located at $34^{\circ}51.6519^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}3.2526\mathrm{\,E}$ at a wate r depth of $1464.2\,\mathrm{m}$ , $10\%$ inch $({\sim}27.3\,\mathrm{cm})$ casing was drilled in to 95. 5 mbsf, and final penetration of the drilling assembly was $105.5\;\mathrm{mbsf}.$ Upon release from the casing, the reentry system hung up on th e underreamer arms, which failed to retract, and the entire assembl y was recovered to the surface.  

Hole U1527C is located at $34^{\circ}51.6625^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}3.2534^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a wate r depth of $1464.1\mathrm{~m~}$ . After installing $95.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of casing, we continuously cored with the RCB system from 99.9 to 238.0 mbsf and recovered $25.9\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(19\%)$ of material. We had extremely poor to n o recovery in unconsolidated volcanic deposits until a formatio n change at 187 mbsf, where average recovery increased to $49\%$ fo r the rest of coring in cemented volcaniclastic rocks. Unstable hol e conditions forced abandonment of Hole U1527C and, once again, the reentry system was unintentionally retrieved because of clogging of the hydraulic release tool (HRT) and upper casing sub. I n total, $249.6\,\mathrm{h}$ , or 10.4 days, were spent at Site U1527.  

# Principal results  

Igneous rocks cored at Site U1527 were divided into two unit s (Figure F7). Igneous Unit 1 was recovered in Holes U1527A (29.10– $67.81~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) and U1527C (108.40–176.16 mbsf). This unit consist s of plagioclase-clinopyroxene-phyric and Fe-Ti oxide–bearing blac k dacite lava with glassy trachytic groundmass and spatially associated fresh scoria and pumice lapilli.  

Igneous Unit 2 was recovered in Hole U1527C (185.20–234.3 8 mbsf). The contact between Igneous Units 1 and 2 was not recovered. Igneous Unit 2 consists of progressively hydrothermally altered lapilli-tuffs, tuff-breccias, and lapillistone and is divided int o four subunits $\left(2\mathbf{a}-2\mathbf{d}\right)$ based on changes in modal composition o f clasts, matrix-to-clast ratio, and color. Subunit 2a (185.20–185.4 4 mbsf) is lapilli-tuffs consisting of fresh dacitic clasts surrounded b y a brown, fine-grained matrix that probably represents altered tuff. Subunit 2b (185.44–220.98 mbsf) is composed of matrix-supporte d monomict and polymict lapilli-tuffs, lapillistones, and tuff-breccias.

Subunit 2c (220.98–226.49 mbsf) is made up of clast-supporte d polymict lapillistones, and Subunit 2d (228.40–234.38 mbsf) i s composed of both altered matrix-supported and clast-supporte d tuff-breccias and lapilli-tuffs.  

Igneous Unit 2 rocks contain various clasts of volcanic origin:  

• Unaltered to slightly altered dacite in Subunit 2a,   
• Volumetrically significant greenish gray altered volcanic clasts in Subunits 2b–2d,   
• Fine-grained, dark green altered clasts in Subunit 2b, and   
• Various types of rare dark gray volcanic clasts in Subunits 2b– 2d.  

The matrix of the volcaniclastic rocks and the groundmass withi n volcanic clasts in Igneous Unit 2 appear very similar to the trachyti c groundmass of the dacite lava of Igneous Unit 1, but they are increasingly replaced by secondary chlorite, clays, and quartz wit h depth. All clasts contain varying amounts of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti oxides, strongly resembling the primary phenocryst assemblage of the dacite lava of Unit 1. Although the degree o f alteration increases downhole, as indicated by the increasing degre e of  silicification,  plagioclase  crystals  are  only  slightly  altered, whereas clinopyroxene is altered significantly or disappears, and FeTi oxides alter to sulfides.  

Three distinct types of alteration are observed in core materia l recovered from Site U1527 (Figure F8). Alteration Type I (0–185.4 4 mbsf) occurs in intervals of fresh to slightly altered volcanic rock s and is characterized by low-temperature alteration mineral assemblages (Figure F9). This alteration type is divided into two distinc t subtypes. Subtype Ia $\mathrm{\left(0{-}185.20\ m b s f\right)}$ occurs within unaltered t o slightly altered vesicular dacite lava and is characterized by the presence of zeolite in vesicles and the occurrence of palagonite, Fe oxyhydroxide, and trace pyrite partly replacing volcanic glass. Subtyp e Ib (185.20−185.44 mbsf) solely pertains to the volcaniclastic rock s of Igneous Subunit 2a, which are slightly to moderately altered. Th e clasts exhibit only trace alteration and retain primary plagioclas e

and clinopyroxene phenocrysts, but the degree of alteration in th e matrix is higher compared to Subtype Ia. The alteration material i n the matrix consists of Fe oxyhydroxide and illite with minor zeolite, smectite, magnetite, and pyrite.  

Alteration Type II (185.72–234.38 mbsf) is characterized by mor e extensive alteration of most primary minerals, with the clasts and matrix of the volcaniclastic rocks being replaced by clay minerals, silica, and pyrite (Figure F9). This alteration type is also divided into tw o subtypes. Subtype IIa (185.72−234.38 mbsf; intercalated with Subtyp e IIb and Type III) features a pervasive green-gray chlorite-smectit e mineral  assemblage  with  increasing  amounts  of  cryptocrystalline/amorphous silica infilling pore spaces and increasin g abundance of disseminated pyrite with depth. Moderate to intense alteration occurs in both clasts and matrix of the primary volcaniclasti c rocks  and  increases  in  intensity  downhole.  Subtype  II b (186.40−208.06 mbsf; intercalated with Subtype IIa) is characterize d by several centimeter- to meter-scale zones of yellow-brown alteration overprinting greenish Subtype IIa. The overprinting boundar y is sharp. Fe oxyhydroxide and occasionally oxidized pyrite give this alteration type its characteristic yellow-brown color. Throughout bot h

the green and yellow-brown altered intervals, clasts display a range o f degrees of alteration and resorption from slightly altered clasts wit h primary igneous textures and sharp boundaries to intensely altere d clasts with diffuse boundaries to the surrounding matrix.  

Alteration Type III (220.98−226.49 mbsf) represents a more heterogeneous alteration type that is intercalated with Subtype IIa. I n this type of alteration, both clasts and matrix are pervasively altere d (Figure F9). The matrix contains dark gray silica and chlorite, disseminated pyrite (as much as $3\,\mathrm{vol}\%$ ), and magnetite. Vugs are partially filled with clay minerals and silica.  

Site U1527 is characterized by moderately to steeply dipping alteration boundaries, fractures, and faults in addition to shallowl y dipping shears and relatively few veins. Alteration boundaries ar e sharp, dip between $0^{\circ}$ and $74^{\circ}$ (average and median $=48^{\circ}$ ), and demarcate the transition from Alteration Subtype IIa to Subtype IIb. Fractures also dip moderately to steeply, from $37^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$ (average $=$ 68°). The density of veins and fractures is low but increases slightl y downhole. Fractures almost always have a brown/orange alteratio n halo overprinting all other types of alteration, which indicates lat e formation of fractures. The presence of brown/orange alteratio n along fractures and defining Subtype IIb may indicate the ingress o f seawater through late-forming fractures. Faults are observed only i n Hole U1527C, dip steeply $(45^{\circ}{-}83^{\circ}$ ; average $=\,66^{\circ}$ ), and are mos t abundant in Igneous Subunit 2c. All faults are discrete centimeterscale zones with a normal sense of shear. Shallowly dipping shear s are defined by elongated ribbons of white clays that may represen t flattened and altered volcanic clasts. White ribbons wrappe d around larger volcanic clasts may indicate some crystal-plastic deformation. The shallowly dipping shears (average $=22^{\circ}$ ) are overprinted by higher angle brittle faults. The overall lack of veins an d indication of late fracturing suggest that alteration is not structurally controlled and may instead be due to pervasive flow.  

Figure F9. Representative intervals of alteration types, Hole U1527C. Type Ia: unaltered to slightly altered clast of dacite (376-U1527C-6R-1, $94{-}101~\mathrm{cm};$ ). Type Ib: dark unaltered clasts of dacite with well-defined boundaries surrounded by altered yellow-brown matrix (11R-1, $0{-}6~{\mathsf{c m}},$ ). Type IIa: pervasively altered clasts surrounded by chlorite-altered matrix (14R-2, 120– $138\,{\mathsf{c m}}^{\mathrm{,}}$ ). Type IIb: overprint of IIb onto IIa (14R-2, $4{-}20~\mathsf{c m},$ ). Type III: pervasively altered clasts with resorbed, gradational boundaries (18R-1, 30–3 9 cm).  

Unaltered volcanic rocks in Hole U1527A and the shallower sections of Hole U1527C (Igneous Unit 1) represent dacites that ar e compositionally similar to those previously reported from Brother s volcano (e.g., Haase et al., 2006; Wright and Gamble, 1999; Timm e t al., 2012). Most of the pervasively altered volcaniclastic rocks recovered from Hole U1527C (Igneous Unit 2) share the incompatible element composition (i.e., $\mathrm{Zr/Y}$ and $\mathrm{Zr/Ti}$ ) of overlying Igneous Uni t 1 from the same hole. This suggests a common parental magma despite petrographic differences.  

Geochemical analyses of the highly altered, variously colore d volcaniclastic rocks demonstrate the mobility of alkali metal s during high- and low-temperature hydrothermal alteration of th e rock (Figure F10). Analyses of $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O},$ , Rb, Ba, $\mathrm{MgO},$ and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ content s define a complex history of hydrothermal overprinting marked b y multiple alteration stages. Alteration Type III displays significan t enrichment in total sulfur content (as much as $1.9\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ). Geochemical changes recorded in Hole U1527C are consistent with petrographic  observations,  including  the  formation  of  pyrite  an d replacement of groundmass and matrix by clay in deeper, more altered volcaniclastic rocks.

Vertical lines $=$ average values of shallower unaltered Igneous Unit 1 in Hole U1527A. Dashed lines $=$ 1σ from average values. The two shallowest samples correspond to relativel y unaltered volcanic material recovered from the BHA in Hole U1527C.  

Organic carbon comprises the bulk of measured total carbo n (TC) concentrations. Detectable only from 185 to 205 mbsf in Hol e U1527C, this organic carbon may originate from seawater-derive d fluid circulation and/or microbial biomass. Headspace analysis o f pore space gases evolved from Hole U1527C hard rock samples indicates higher than ambient $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ contents that may have been produced by mechanochemical sampling artifacts such as generatio n during RCB drilling and/or crushing rock samples prior to headspace sampling.  

The two igneous units at Site U1527 have different natural remanent magnetization (NRM) intensities before demagnetization; samples from Igneous Unit 1 show more intense NRM $\mathrm{(>}0.5\;\mathrm{A/m)}$ than those from Igneous Unit 2. However, the direction of magnetization is consistent in both units, with an average inclination o f $-59^{\circ}$ , which is very close to the inclination of a geomagnetic axia l dipole (GAD) of $-55^{\circ}$ at the latitude of Brothers volcano. This consistent GAD inclination suggests a young age for these rocks, mos t certainly from the current normal polarity Brunhes geomagneti c epoch. Igneous Unit 1 also has significantly larger magnetic coercivities than Igneous Unit 2. Thermal demagnetization experiment s from Unit 2 show a more complex pattern compared to similar experiments from Igneous Unit 1 but indicate magnetite or titanomagnetite as the main magnetic mineral in both igneous units. I n addition, susceptibility measurements and isothermal remanenc e magnetization (IRM) experiments suggest comparable magnetit e content in both units, with a slight decrease in Subunits 2c and 2d.  

![](images/68aa060f9679668984a1aeb6b77e159442540fbb52c6a9f2ee4929c07476b5b4.jpg)  

The fresh dacitic volcanics of Igneous Unit 1 show an invers e correlation between porosity and bulk density, but no such correlation is observed between $P$ -wave velocity and bulk density or $P_{-}$ - wave velocity and porosity. Variably altered volcaniclastic rocks i n Igneous Unit 2 display an inverse correlation between porosity an d bulk density and between porosity and $P$ -wave velocity. Mean bul k density $(2.2\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , porosity $(30\%)$ , and $P$ -wave velocity $(3330~\mathrm{m/s})$ ) generally show small variations throughout Unit 2 and do not appear to be affected by transitions between alteration types. Alteration Subtypes IIa and IIb are clearly identifiable in reflectanc e colorimetry data. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity sharply increases at the boundar y between Subunits 2b and $2c$ $\left.\sim\!4000\right.$ and $4200\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ on section halve s and discrete samples, respectively) followed by a downhole decreas e in $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity to the bottom of Subunit 2c. In Subunit 2c, thi s variation in $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity is reflected in a similar trend in bul k density and matching inverse variation in porosity, which appears t o be associated with deformation and shear in this unit.  

Magnetic susceptibility measured on whole-round and section-half cores is consistent with discrete measurements. Magnetic susceptibility in Igneous Subunits 2a and 2b is overall highe r than that in Subunits 2c and 2d. Thermal conductivity ranges fro m 1.09 to $2.35\:\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ (average $=1.72\;\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K}]);$ ; Igneous Unit 2 ha s higher values than Igneous Unit 1. Thermal conductivity in Igneous Unit 2 varies over smaller scales, reflecting changes in type an d distribution of alteration minerals. Thermal conductivity is lowe r where alteration is dominated by the presence of water-rich cla y minerals (e.g., low of $1.53\,\mathrm{\:W/[m.K]}$ in Subunit 2b at ${\sim}203.40\$ mbsf), whereas the highest thermal conductivity is observed alon g with increases in pyrite, silica, and magnetite concentrations i n Subunit 2c. Hence, thermal conductivity data reflect the heterogeneity of mineral compositions and alteration assemblages throughout the core.  

Five whole-round samples (each $11-~20~\,\mathrm{cm}$ long) collecte d from hydrothermally altered, relatively hard materials in Hol e U1527C (Table T2) were processed and preserved as subsample s for shore-based biological investigations that will include quantification of microbial and viral biomass, molecular analysis of th e microbial communities from extracted DNA and RNA, estimatio n of microbial metabolic activity and viral production, and cultivation of subseafloor microbial components. Quantification of th e perfluoromethyldecalin (PFMD) contamination tracer was conducted for the drilling fluid and the exterior and interior parts o f whole-round samples. PFMD was routinely detected, althoug h barely above detection levels, suggesting that penetration of drilling fluids to the interior of whole-round samples was minimal.

# Site U1528  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1528 (proposed Site UC-1A) is located inside a small ( ${\sim}40$ m diameter at the top, ${\sim}25~\mathrm{m}$ diameter at the bottom) pit crater a t the summit of the Upper Cone of Brothers volcano at a water dept h of $1228\;\mathrm{m}$ (Figure F6). The primary objective at this site was to drill into the upflow zone of the Type II hydrothermal system that i s strongly influenced by magmatic degassing. In this area, discharg e of relatively gas rich, very acidic fluids has resulted in advanced argillic alteration. Site U1528 addresses important Expedition 376 objectives related to the role of magmatically influenced hydrothermal fluids in transporting metals to the seafloor and provides a comparison of fluid–rock reactions with the Type I seawater-dominated hydrothermal system drilled at Sites U1527 and U1530.  

# Operations  

We conducted operations in four holes at Site U1528 (Table T1) . Hole U1528A is located at $34^{\circ}52.9177^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}4.1070^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a wate r depth of $1228.4\;\mathrm{m}$ . We used the RCB system to core from the seafloor to 84.4 mbsf and recovered $17.1\;\mathrm{m}\;(20\%)$ . The downhole conditions encountered in Hole U1528A dictated the need to deploy  a reentry system to achieve our objectives.  

Hole U1528B is located $10~\mathrm{~m~}$ south of Hole U1528A a t $34^{\circ}52.9222^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}4.1077^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $1229.4\mathrm{~m~}$ . Here, w e drilled-in $10\%$ inch casing to 24.3 mbsf, with the drilling assembl y penetrating to 25.6 mbsf. We had trouble extracting the drilling assembly from the reentry system, which ultimately took several hours. Because of drilling-induced suspension of sediment in th e seawater, visibility was limited and we could see only the top of th e reentry funnel, observed to be at a water depth of $1224.8\ \mathrm{m}_{}$ , whic h was consistent with it being properly set on the seafloor. After tw o separate unsuccessful attempts to reenter Hole U1528B with bot h the RCB system and the CDEX turbine-driven coring syste m (TDCS), we suspended operations. Further visual observation s showed the reentry system was sitting at a slight angle that prevented the drill string from passing through the throat of the reentry funnel.  

Our next objective was to perform the first offshore test of th e TDCS. In Hole U1528C, located at $34^{\circ}52.9215^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}4.1128^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at  a water depth of $1229.1\;\mathrm{m},$ we drilled without coring using the TDC S to 22 mbsf and then cored to $53.5\ \mathrm{mbsf},$ , recovering $_{3.6\textrm{m}}$ $(12\%)$ . Further advancement was prevented by a broken core barrel that remained in the TDCS bottom-hole assembly (BHA), forcing abandonment of Hole U1528C.  

In Hole U1528D, located at $34^{\circ}52.9219^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}4.1164^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ in th e very limited flat central area of the pit crater and at a water depth o f $1228.1\ \mathrm{m}$ , we drilled in $13\%$ inch $({\sim}35.2~\mathrm{cm)}$ casing to 59.4 mbsf, with the drilling assembly penetrating to 61.3 mbsf. We then RC B cored to 359.3 mbsf and recovered $87.2\textrm{m}(29\%)$ under good hol e conditions. After the bit reached $40\,\mathrm{~h~}$ of rotation time, when i t would normally be changed before continuing to core, we instea d decided to take downhole temperature measurements and obtai n borehole fluid samples in the open hole through the existing bit.  

The Elevated Borehole Temperature Sensor (ETBS) memor y tool was deployed first and recorded a maximum temperature o f $35\mathrm{^\circC}$ at 357 mbsf, which was $2~\mathrm{m}$ above the drilled bottom of th e hole. The subsequent deployment of the $1000\,\mathrm{\mL}$ Kuster FlowThrough Sampler (FTS) tool ended with its failure under compression in the open hole. We then made an unsuccessful attempt to recover the tool with a fishing tool BHA equipped with boot-typ e junk baskets. Reentry into Hole U1528D was complicated by  a plume emanating from the reentry funnel. We next deployed a logging BHA, lowered the backup $600\;\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool on the cor e line, and successfully recovered a fluid sample from 279 mbsf.  A subsequent ETBS downhole temperature measurement at the sam e depth recorded a maximum temperature of $212^{\circ}C$ , confirming tha t the flasked wireline high-temperature triple combo (HTTC) logging tool string (natural gamma radiation [NGR], litho-density, an d temperature tools) could be deployed. We successfully performe d two upward logging passes from 323 mbsf. Another deployment o f the $600\;\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool then recovered a second borehole flui d sample from 313 mbsf; subsequent deployment of the ETBS memory tool recorded a maximum temperature of $165\mathrm{^\circC}$ (following col d seawater circulation). Next, we drilled down with a tricone bit BH A to clean out the hole to $356~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , which was the depth of the top o f the lost $1000\,\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool.  

A concave mill bit and two boot-type junk baskets were then deployed to attempt to remove the remaining parts of the lost 100 0 mL Kuster FTS tool. After reentering Hole U1528D for the sixt h time and despite very poor visibility around the reentry funnel, w e advanced the mill bit to the bottom of the hole at 359.3 mbsf. Upo n recovery, there was no evidence of the $1000~\mathrm{{mL}}$ Kuster FTS tool i n the boot baskets. The next fishing attempt used the reverse-circulation junk basket (RCJB) assembled in conjunction with the boottype junk baskets. After the seventh reentry of Hole U1528D, w e worked the RCJB BHA back to bottom $(359.3\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ , where we circulated 25 bbl of high-viscosity mud for ${\sim}15\,\mathrm{min}$ while working th e RCJB up and down. When the end of the drill string cleared the ri g floor, the discovery that the lowermost $172.8\;\mathrm{m}$ was missing ende d Hole U1528D drilling operations. The drill string failed in a piece o f 5 inch pipe above the BHA. The recovered broken piece showed significant damage directly attributable to the corrosive downhole environment.  

Upon completion of coring operations at Site U1531, we returned to Hole U1528D $\left[\sim\!3\right]$ weeks later) to conduct a series of alternating downhole temperature measurements using both the ETB S memory tool and Petrospec spool-in thermocouple memory too l (TCMT) and two $600~\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool deployments that resulted in recovering a borehole fluid sample from 160 mbsf. Tw o successful temperature measurement runs recorded maximu m temperatures of $198^{\circ}C$ (ETBS) at 195 mbsf and $156^{\circ}C$ (TCMT) a t 160 mbsf. Site U1528 operations concluded with successful recovery of the failed Hole U1528B reentry system at the end of Expedition 376. In total, $568.9\,\mathrm{h},$ or 23.7 days, were spent at Site U1528.  

# Principal results  

Rocks cored at Site U1528 are divided into three igneous unit s (Figure F11). Igneous Unit 1, recovered in Holes U1528A (0–6.0 3 mbsf) and U1528C (26.50–31.41 mbsf), consists of polymict lapill i tephra made up of subangular to subrounded volcanic clasts tha t have experienced varying degrees of alteration. Igneous Unit 2, recovered in Holes U1528A (16.30–83.57 mbsf), U1528C (35.50–46.0 0 mbsf), and U1528D (61.30–269.30 mbsf), is divided into three subunits based on internal rock fabric and the presence of primary min

erals. Subunits 2a and 2c are composed of sequences of altere d lapillistones and lapilli-tuffs with subordinate intervals of altere d tuffs and tuff-breccias. Clasts are volcanic in origin and altered t o differing degrees; the matrix consists of secondary mineral assemblages. Identification of original lithologies becomes increasingly difficult with depth (especially in Subunit 2c). More coherent, massiv e dacite lava, affected by a lesser degree of alteration, occur betwee n 152.90 and 160.17 mbsf and make up Subunit 2b. Igneous Unit 3, recovered exclusively in Hole U1528D (162.50–269.03 mbsf), consist s of altered dacite lava with some relatively unaltered intervals.  

The dacitic pyroclastic rocks and lavas at Site U1528 are pervasively altered yet still show distinct similarities in petrography an d whole-rock geochemistry to unaltered volcanic materials encountered in Igneous Unit 1 at Sites U1527, U1529, and U1531 and t o published descriptions and geochemical results for unaltered dacit e recovered elsewhere at Brothers volcano (e.g., Haase et al., 2006;  

Wright and Gamble, 1999; Timm et al., 2012). Even though interval s with (partially) unaltered phenocrysts are rare, primary igneou s textures such as vesicles and the crystal shapes of plagioclase an d (rarely) pyroxene phenocrysts and microlites, now infilled and replaced by secondary minerals, can be recognized in most samples. Petrography and the abundance of elements that are less affected b y alteration suggest that the Site U1528 protolith was dacitic tephr a and lava similar to that previously encountered at Brothers volcano.  

Four distinct alteration types are observed in core material recovered from Site U1528 (Figure F12). Alteration Type I (0– 35.9 mbsf), classified as slightly altered, occurs in unconsolidate d gravels. The dominant alteration mineral assemblage consists o f smectite with minor pyrite, opal, natroalunite, pyrophyllite, and native sulfur. Two distinct volcanic clast colors are observed: dark gra y clasts, which contain more smectite, and light gray clasts. Nativ e sulfur occurs in crystalline tabular (orthorhombic) and globula r grain morphologies.  

Alteration Type II (classified as highly altered) occurs in severa l intervals throughout Site U1528 (e.g., 148.1–154.4 mbsf) and i s characterized by an alteration mineral assemblage of illite, smectite, opal, quartz, pyrite, and anhydrite. Alteration is typically blue-gra y in color, manifests by brecciation, and exhibits relict perlitic textur e (Figure F13). Plagioclase phenocrysts are variably pseudomorphe d by natroalunite and anhydrite, whereas pyroxene is pseudomorphe d by anhydrite, smectite, and pyrite. The latter is abundant (average $=$ $1\!-\!5\;\mathrm{vol\%}$ and occurs not only in pyroxene pseudomorphs but als o as subhedral to euhedral disseminated grains and in discrete vein s associated with anhydrite. Primary titanomagnetite is rimmed an d shows progressive replacement by pyrite that exhibits skeletal texture and contains abundant anhydrite inclusions.  

Alteration Type III, classified as highly to intensely altered, is intercalated with Type II (e.g., 239.3–264. 5 mbsf), and the boundar y between these alteration types can be either gradational or sharp. Type III is represented by pervasively altered white-gray volcaniclastic rocks (Figure F13). A mineral assemblage of natroalunite, pyrophyllite, and rutile with lesser quartz, opal, smectite, pyrite, an d anhydrite, characterizes Type III. Natroalunite, pyrophyllite, and silica are more abundant in the matrix, whereas smectite is enriche d

in clast material. Plagioclase and pyroxene are completely pseudomorphed by natroalunite, anhydrite, and pyrite. Late-stage anhydrite-pyrite  veins  commonly  cut  pseudomorphed  plagioclas e crystals. Titanomagnetite is almost completely replaced with leucoxene and pyrite. Vugs are infilled with anhydrite and minor pyrite, native sulfur, natroalunite, and silica. In addition, fine-grained pyrite is finely disseminated throughout matrix and clasts.  

Alteration Type IV is defined by discrete to diffuse whit e veins that cut and postdate Types II and III. Type IV is first observed at 77.2 mbsf and occurs until the cored bottom of Hol e U1528D at 355.1 mbsf. It is characterized by an alteration assemblage of natroalunite, anhydrite, rutile, quartz, opal, native sulfur, and pyrophyllite (Figure F13). Mineralogically, Type IV is distinguished from Types II and III by higher abundances of native sulfur, silica, and rutile. This alteration type occurs as discrete whit e veins and distinct alteration halos typically $<\!1\ \mathrm{cm}$ but occasionally as wide as $4~\mathrm{{cm}}$ and commonly with a vuggy texture, overprinting  previous  alteration  and  often  preserving  earlie r alteration textures. Pyrite is generally absent or oxidized to F e oxyhydroxides within the halos, and native sulfur is the majo r mineral phase infilling vugs.  

Fluid inclusions in the most recent vug and vein crystals of anhydrite, quartz, natroalunite, and gypsum indicate that the hydrothermal system at Site U1528 is highly dynamic. Two dominan t fluid types are variably involved in fluid-rock interactions (Figur e F14): a buoyant, hot $(220^{\circ}{-}360^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ , sulfur-rich, acidic hypersalin e brine $(\mathrm{NaCl}>30\;\mathrm{wt\%})$ ) and hot modified seawater. A massive influ x of seawater $\mathrm{(NaCl}=3.5~\mathrm{wt\%)}$ ) locally overwhelmed the hypersalin e brine along fractures or pervasively diffused into the hot formation, where it is heated to temperatures of $55^{\circ}{-}360^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Fluid inclusion salinities plot into two separate regions: (1) at or near seawater compositions and (2) as a hypersaline brine at or along the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ saturation curve. Both regions are attributed to depressurization i n the formation caused by sudden fracturing events, resulting i n phase separation (Figure F14). This process gives rise to a more saline, higher density fluid for both hypersaline brine and seawate r and, at the same time, forms a low-density vapor phase that condenses through cooling to a low-salinity aqueous solution unde r subcritical conditions.  

Structures that occur across Holes U1528A, U1528C, an d U1528D include volcanic fabrics, alteration veins, and fractures. Volcanic fabrics are best observed in Holes U1528A and U1528 D and are defined by vesicles and plagioclase microlites (primary an d altered) and, to a lesser extent, phenocrysts. Volcanic fabrics hav e two forms, those in volcanic clasts and those in coherent lavas. Vol

canic fabrics within clasts can be weak to strong, but each clast ha s a distinct orientation, suggesting brecciation after fabric formation. Fabrics over continuous intervals (i.e., lavas) have a similar orientation and tend to dip ${>}45^{\circ}$ . Peaks in volcanic fabric intensity are observed in Igneous Subunit 2b and Igneous Unit 3 in Hole U1528D.  

Alteration veins occur throughout Holes U1528A and U1528 D across all igneous units and alteration types. Veins are most commonly filled by anhydrite, pyrite, silica, and native sulfur and ar e typically uniform but can be vuggy; some have halos. The presenc e of halos is the basis for Alteration Type IV. Vein density peaks between 100 and 190 mbsf, which is coincident with a peak in nativ e sulfur, vuggy veins, and a deviation in borehole temperature. Vei n dip varies from horizontal to vertical, with an average of ${\sim}60^{\circ}$ i n both holes. The distribution of dips downhole is variable: a fe w zones have a large range in dip (e.g., $0^{\circ}{-}90^{\circ})$ and other zones hav e dips ${>}45^{\circ}$ . Vein thickness ranges from 0.05 to $1~\mathrm{{cm}}$ and average s ${\sim}0.2~\mathrm{cm}$ . Vein thickness is variable downhole, but it appears to increase in intervals with a large range of vein dip, and thicker vein s tend to have steeper dips.  

Fractures are observed in all three holes, but their abundance i s limited. Fractures in Hole U1528C are irregular and lined with native S. Native S is more abundant where the fractures are irregular. In Hole U1528D, fractures are typically clustered in the uppermos t $175\;\mathrm{m}$ of the hole and have steeper dips (i.e., ${>}60^{\circ}$ ). Fracture densit y has three peaks; the one near 290 mbsf coincides with a deviation i n borehole temperature and a large range in vein dip.

troscopy (ICP-AES) for major, minor, and trace elements and via elemental analysis for TC, total nitrogen (TN), and total sulfur. Results of these analyses were used to define major geochemica l changes during hydrothermal fluid-seawater-rock interactions i n Hole U1528D. Variable extents of depletion in alkalis (K and Na), Mg, Fe, and Mn and strong enrichment in total sulfur (as much a s $15\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) occur throughout the hole. In Igneous Unit 1, $\mathrm{Zr/Ti}$ value s range from 30.0 to $31.3\,\mathrm{mg/g}$ and are indistinguishable from averag e $\mathrm{Zr/Ti}$ values for Unit 1 in Hole U1527A and at Site U1529 (i.e., $30.5-$ $32.3~\mathrm{mg/g})$ . This similarity suggests that the upper lava and tephr a units recovered at Sites U1527–U1529 may derive from similar parental magmas. Considering that Y is relatively mobile under hydrothermal conditions in contrast to $Z\mathbf{r},$ the $\mathrm{Y/Zr}$ value of altere d volcaniclastics is used as a tracer for the extent of alteration. Tw o main intervals are characterized by lower $\mathrm{Y/Zr}$ value (i.e., relative t o unaltered dacite from Brothers volcano): (1) 46–95.5 mbsf in Igneous Subunit 2a, dominated by Alteration Type III, and (2) 240–32 5 mbsf overlapping Subunit 2c and Igneous Unit 3 and associated alternating Types II and III. Variable extents of depletion in alkalis (K, Rb, and Na), $\mathrm{Mg}$ , Ca, and Fe and strong enrichment in total S (a s much as $15\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) occur throughout the hole (Figure F15). Based o n average compositions of discrete intervals throughout the entir e $360~\mathrm{m}$ section in Hole U1528D, we estimate that $>\!75\%$ of both M n and Mg have been lost because of hydrothermal alteration. Othe r significantly depleted elements include a ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ loss of Na, K, and R b and a ${>}30\%$ loss of Ca and P. Total S contents vary between 2.1 an d $15.1\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ because of the formation of S-dominated secondary minerals (e.g., natroalunite, native S, pyrite, and anhydrite); anhydrit e represents a significant component of the total S inventory $.{\sim}22\%$ on average). Fe appears to be strongly depleted in late-stage Type I V alteration, suggesting that $\mathrm{pH},{f\mathrm{O}_{2}},$ and $f\ensuremath{\mathrm{S}}_{2}$ conditions changed substantially from Types II and III, leading to extensive loss of Fe i n possibly $\Sigma{S O_{4}}$ -rich but $\Sigma\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ -poor hydrothermal fluids. Similar t o Site U1527, organic carbon comprises the bulk of measured T C content but remains very low, yielding an average of ${\sim}250~\upmu\mathrm{g/g}$ a t Site U1528.  

One sample of interstitial water (376-U1528C-7N-1, 140–15 0 cm) recovered from 45.9 mbsf has a low $\mathsf{p H}$ of 4.1, which is consistent with the presence of acidic magmatic fluids. Nearly equimola r enrichments in Ca and $\Sigma{\cal S}{\cal O}_{4}$ suggest that dissolution of anhydrite a t low temperatures may be occurring in the pore water.  

Three borehole fluid samples were collected from Hole U1528 D using the $600~\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool at ${\sim}279$ and ${\sim}313$ mbsf and the n 23 days later at 160 mbsf. Estimated temperatures of $212^{\circ}$ an d $>\!236^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for the first two samples and $140^{\circ}C$ for the later sample wer e determined by downhole logging. The fluids have nearly identical Cl, Br, and $\mathrm{Mg}$ concentrations, and Na concentrations are all lowe r than seawater. Highly elevated $\Sigma{\cal S O}_{4}$ and very acidic $\mathsf{p H}$ values (a s low as 1.8) are characteristic of acid-sulfate fluid. Results indicat e that the low-salinity borehole fluids are not derived from phase separation of circulating seawater but rather that they acquired thei r geochemical signatures through the direct input of magmatic fluid s to unaltered seawater at temperatures of at least $350^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . During flui d origin and upflow, $\mathrm{Mg}$ and K are removed from rock and added t o fluids during fluid-rock reaction, which is balanced by a net remova l of $\Sigma{S O}_{4},$ Ca, and Sr from the fluids into secondary minerals, primarily as natroalunite and/or anhydrite.  

Gas pore space components, including $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ $\Sigma C O_{2},$ and acid-volatile S, are elevated over ambient atmospheric levels. These anomalies may derive from subseafloor hydrothermal input of volatile-ric h fluids that share similar chemical properties with the seafloor hydrothermal fluids discharging at the Upper and Lower Cone sites.  

Eighty-three archive halves were measured for NRM and underwent alternating field (AF) demagnetization experiments using th e cryogenic magnetometer. The sections show generally low NRM intensities where the largest pieces have primary magnetization components (after AF steps of $20\;\mathrm{~mT~}$ ) with negative inclinations, suggesting normal polarities. AF and thermal demagnetization experiments on 82 discrete samples from Igneous Units 2 and 3 wer e also carried out. The drilling-induced overprint is generally remove d after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization on the discrete samples, leaving, i n most cases, a stable primary magnetization. The two igneous unit s have very low NRM intensities, which is in agreement with the observations from the cryogenic magnetometer. Both units show a consistent direction of magnetization with average inclination compatibl e with the inclination of a GAD of $-55^{\circ}$ at the present-day latitude o f Brothers volcano. This consistent GAD inclination suggests a coherent young age for these rocks, most certainly representing the curren t normal polarity Brunhes geomagnetic epoch. Thermal demagnetization experiments from these units show a complex pattern, suggesting irreversible transformation of magnetic minerals during heatin g to ${>}400^{\circ}\mathrm{C};$ this transformation is confirmed by changes in the magnetic susceptibilities measured with the AGICO Kappabridge susceptibility meter before and after heating. In addition, IRM experiment s suggest that these rocks contain minerals with large magnetic coercivities, such as titanohematite, in addition to titanomagnetite.  

Physical property measurements for Igneous Unit 1 (Alteratio n Type I) are consistent with the ranges expected for fresh unconsolidated dacitic volcaniclastics. In Igneous Units 2 and 3, more complex variations in physical properties associated with igneous uni t and/or alteration type are observed. For example, magnetic susceptibility is generally higher in intervals of Alteration Type II tha n Type III (Figure F12), which may be explained by the observed partial replacement of titanomagnetite by rutile and pyrite in the relatively more altered rocks of Type III. Downhole measurements als o indicate an association between Type II and increases in NGR attributed to $^{40}\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{i}}$ ; however, this association could not be confirmed b y NGR measurements in the laboratory because of the recovered cor e material was fragmented. The relatively high $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ NGR signal identified in a core from Type III alteration (Section 376-U1528D-48R-1 ) is consistent with this observation.  

The boundary between Igneous Units 2 and 3 is clearly define d by changes in grain density, bulk density, porosity, $P$ -wave velocity, and thermal conductivity and by an increase in magnetic susceptibility. By contrast, boundaries between igneous subunits within Igneous Unit 2 are less clearly defined by variations in physica l properties. An interval of relatively lower bulk density and $P$ -wav e velocity and higher porosity is observed between ${\sim}145$ and ${\sim}220$ mbsf but is not associated with a defined igneous subunit or alteration type boundary. Instead, this interval corresponds to the dept h at which $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ gas was smelled during core splitting, and its boundaries correspond to a borehole temperature anomaly and increase d fracture densities, vein thicknesses, and range of vein dip.  

A series of downhole measurements was conducted and borehole fluid was sampled at the end of Hole U1528D coring operations. Three runs of the ETBS memory tool were completed in Hol e U1258D. The first deployment, made prior to logging to help determine which logging tools could be deployed, measured an averag e temperature of $33^{\circ}C$ at 357 mbsf.  

A high-temperature flasked wireline logging string consisting o f litho-density, NGR, and logging head temperature tools was run t o 332 mbsf in Hole U1528D. Variations in the total NGR measurements are mostly related to peaks in K, generally correlated to Alteration Type II, which is rich in illite. Overall, the downhole densit y log correlates well with bulk density measured on the core sample s and shows trends that are generally correlated with igneous unit s and subunits:  

• From 65 to 145 mbsf (Igneous Subunit 2a), density gradually decreases downhole;   
• From 145 to 250 mbsf, density decreases sharply (between 140 and 155 mbsf; Subunit 2b) followed by a gradual increase with depth (Subunit 2c); and   
• From 250 to 330 mbsf, density is very variable (Igneous Unit 3).  

Downhole caliper measurements revealed three zones of washout s where the borehole diameter exceeded $33.0\,\ c\mathrm{m}$ (13 inches) an d reached up to $43.2\,\mathrm{cm}$ (17 inches): 149–162, 195–210, and 297–32 4 mbsf. The median diameter was determined to be $28.5~\mathrm{cm}$ (11. 2 inches), which only slightly exceeds the drill bit diameter of $25.1\,\mathrm{cm}$ $9\%$ inches). Two bridges were encountered on top $(292\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ an d at the bottom $(323\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ of the deepest washout interval while lowering the logging tool string.  

The three temperature profiles acquired during wireline logging suggest a convective temperature regime with small temperature increases at ${\sim}100$ and 150 mbsf and larger increases at ${\sim}275$ and 295 mbsf. A temperature reversal (i.e., a decrease in temperature with depth) is observed at ${\sim}250{-}260~\mathrm{mbsf}.$ . Over the $2.5~\mathrm{h}$ o f logging, the temperature increased by ${\sim}8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in the isotherma l zones and by $24.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ between 270 and 310 mbsf, reaching $247^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . This increase suggests that the downhole temperatures had no t yet reached equilibrium. The temperature anomalies at $\mathord{\sim}150$ an d ${\sim}295$ mbsf are accompanied by increases in borehole diameter, peaks in K, the first instance of $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ odor emanating from th e cores, native S observed in veins, high fracture density with varie d fracture dips, crosscutting fractures, and increased vein density. These zones are interpreted to be structurally controlled permeable intervals.  

In total, 3, 1, and 13 whole-round samples ( $3{-}16\;\mathrm{cm}$ long) wer e collected from Holes U1528A, U1528C, and U1528D, respectively, for microbiological analyses (Table T2). The sampled lithologie s represent the various igneous units recovered. Samples were processed for shore-based DNA and RNA analyses, cell and viral counting, and viral and microbial activity measurements. All samples were analyzed on board for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration; two samples gave positive values. The other sample s contained compounds that inhibited the enzyme, luciferase, use d for the ATP test. Nutrient addition bioassays with inorganic N an d P, or organic carbon, were initiated to determine the nutritional constraints on biomass in this environment. PFMD was used fo r contamination testing. PFMD was usually detected on the outsid e of uncleaned cores and, on rare occasions, was above detection levels on the cleaned outside of cores. However, it was usually belo w detection on the inside of cores, indicating that penetration of drilling fluid to the interior of whole-round drill cores (where we collected samples) is unlikely.  

# Site U1529  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1529 (proposed Site WC-1A) is located on the wester n side of the caldera floor of Brothers volcano at a water depth of 176 5 m (Figure F6). The primary objective for this site was to drill a second hole (the first was at Site U1527) into the margin of the upflo w zone of a hydrothermal system dominated by modified seawater-derived fluids. This site was planned to penetrate deeper into the hydrothermal system and obtain a record of the recent eruptiv e history in the caldera.  

# Operations  

We conducted operations in two holes at Site U1529 (Table T1). Hole U1529A is located at $34^{\circ}52.5161^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}3.5139^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a wate r depth of $1735.0\;\mathrm{m}$ . We used the RCB system to core from the seafloor to $12.0\ \mathrm{mbsf},$ , with poor recovery of $1.86~\mathrm{m}$ $(16\%)$ . The downhole conditions encountered in Hole U1529A were extremel y difficult because of the unconsolidated volcaniclastic material, which caused high torque and tight hole conditions that ended drilling this hole. In Hole U1529B, located at $34^{\circ}52.5217^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}3.5207^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $1733.0\ \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , RCB coring under similarly difficul t hole conditions penetrated to only $34.4\;\mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{}}$ , with very poor recovery of $0.6\mathrm{~m~}(1.7\%)$ . After observing a tight hole, we attempted t o work the drill string back to ${\sim}15$ mbsf but lost circulation becaus e the bit and jets were plugged with volcaniclastic material. This los s of circulation resulted in abandonment of Hole U1529B. An $8.2~\mathrm{m}$ long ghost core was recovered from the core barrel that was in plac e while working the drill string out of the hole. In total, $44.0\;\mathrm{h},$ or 1. 8 days, were spent at Site U1529.  

# Principal results  

A single igneous unit was recovered from Holes U1529A $\left(0-\right.$ $2.52\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ and U1529B (0–24.82 mbsf). Igneous Unit 1 consists o f decimeter-thick  alternating  intervals  of  unaltered,  black  plagioclase-pyroxene-phyric dacite lava and unconsolidated, blac k monomict lapilli tephra (Figure F16). The contacts between the lavas and the tephra were not recovered. The moderately vesicula r $(\sim\!10\,\mathrm{vol\%})$ lava was recovered as individual pieces that are $0.5{-}6\,\mathrm{cm}$ long. The lava has a hypohyaline texture with groundmass rich i n flow-aligned plagioclase microlites and shows fine fracture networks indicative of incipient breakup. The lapilli tephra consists o f fine ash– to medium lapilli–sized angular to subangular fragment s of dacite lava and fragments of plagioclase and pyroxene crystals. Dacite lavas at Site U1529 resemble the dacites recovered at Sit e U1527.  

The ghost core from Hole U1529B, which contains materia l from anywhere between 0 and $34.4~\mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{}}$ , similarly consists of unconsolidated, unaltered, black lapilli-ash ranging in size from ash t o medium lapilli. Ash- and lapilli-sized clasts are subangular and angular with a vesicularity and mineral assemblage (plagioclase-clinopyroxene phenocrysts and glomerocrysts) consistent with the lapill i tephra being a mixture of Igneous Unit 1 volcanic rocks.  

The volcanic rocks of Igneous Unit 1 appear unaltered t o slightly altered. Alteration Type I is the only alteration type recognized at this site and occurs within the lapilli tephra and coarse r fragments of dacite lava. The alteration type is defined by the presence of minor smectite and Fe oxyhydroxide replacing phenocryst s and groundmass and lining some vesicles. A few individual clasts i n Unit 1 are more strongly altered and contain microcrystalline silica, Fe oxyhydroxide, and a green clay mineral.

At Site U1529, no meaningful structural measurements could b e made because no pieces of oriented core were recovered. Som e pieces of dacite have a network of microfractures, but no faults o r alteration veins are present. In both Holes U1529A and U1529B, th e main structure observed is a shape-preferred orientation define d macroscopically by vesicles and microscopically by vesicles, phenocrysts, and microlites.  

Unaltered to slightly altered clasts and lapilli from Igneous Uni t 1 are typical dacites, with $\mathrm{SiO_{2}}$ content ranging from 62.3 to 65. 4 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ and $\mathrm{Na_{2}O+K_{2}O}$ content varying from 6.61 to $7.07\:\mathrm{wt}\%$ . Thes e dacites are similar in major element composition to unaltered dacites at Site U1527 and consistent with the small compositional rang e previously reported for dacites at Brothers volcano (e.g., Haase e t al., 2006; Wright and Gamble, 1999; Timm et al., 2012).  

The uppermost sample $(0.06\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ from Hole U1529A and tw o samples from the ghost core have lower values of TC $(<\!200\ \upmu\mathrm{g/g)}$ compared with the other five samples from this hole, for which T C ranges from 221 to $344\;\upmu\mathrm{g/g}$ . Total S contents are ${<}220\ \upmu\mathrm{g/g}.$ , whic h is consistent with total S abundances previously reported fro m Brothers volcano. Total N and total inorganic carbon are below th e limit of detection in all Site U1529 samples.  

No paleomagnetic measurements were performed on the samples from Site U1529 because of the absence of any oriented cor e pieces. Moreover, the low recovery and fragmented nature of th e clasts and volcaniclastic sediments made the cores mostly unsuitable for continuous physical property measurements on wholeround cores and section halves. However, NGR measurements fo r Hole U1529A recorded values of ${\sim}13$ counts/s (1.9 mbsf), and Section-Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL) point data indicate magnetic susceptibilities as high as ${\sim}2250\times10^{-5}$ IU $^{15.14}\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ .  

Five discrete samples from Hole U1529A and three sample s from Hole U1529B, including cut clasts and volcaniclastics, wer e analyzed for moisture and density. Bulk density ranges from 1.92 t o $2.37~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3};$ , whereas grain density ranges from 2.43 to $2.50~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ . Porosity varies from 6 to $38~\mathrm{vol\%}$ and is inversely correlated wit h bulk density. Three measurements of $P$ -wave velocity made in the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ - direction on coherent clasts in section halves of Hole U1529A var y from ${\sim}3500$ to $4500~\mathrm{m/s}$ . No thermal conductivity measurement s were made because of the limited recovery and fragmented natur e of the material.  

No samples were collected from Site U1529 for microbiologica l analyses because of the nature of the recovered material.

# Site U1530  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1530 (proposed Site NWC-3A) is located on a narro w bench on the NW Caldera site of Brothers volcano at a water dept h of $1595\;\mathrm{m}$ (Figure F6). The primary objective at this site was to dril l through the lower part of the Alteration Type I hydrothermal system. Site U1530 is located ${\sim}400\mathrm{~m~}$ east of Site U1527 on a ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ long by ${\sim}10\mathrm{~m~}$ wide bench toward the upper part of the NW Caldera wall and is structurally above a known prominent metal-ric h stockwork zone. The operations plan at Site U1530 was to penetrat e ${\sim}450\;\mathrm{m}$ through the upper stockwork and then into deeper portion s of the inferred hydrothermal upflow zone and continue through  a thicker stratigraphic section of lavas in the caldera, hoping to intersect the footwall of the original caldera. Intersection of the stockwork was expected to provide the best opportunity to investigat e the transport of metals through the Brothers volcano hydrotherma l system.  

# Operations  

Operations were conducted in one hole at Site U1530 (Tabl e T1). Hole U1530A is located at $34^{\circ}51.6588^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}3.4572^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $1594.9\mathrm{~m~}$ . We used the RCB system to core from th e seafloor to 453.1 mbsf and recovered $76.8\;\mathrm{m}\;(17\%)$ . We encountere d optimum downhole conditions throughout coring. After successfully penetrating to target depth, we decided to terminate coring i n Hole U1530A to take advantage of the good hole conditions fo r downhole measurements and fluid sampling. Therefore, we released the bit in the bottom of the hole by deploying the rotary shifting tool.  

Our downhole measurement plan for Hole U1530A consisted o f running the following tools/tool strings:  

• ETBS memory tool,   
• $600\;\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool,   
• triple combo tool string (NGR, porosity, and density sondes, including magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, caliper, and logging head temperature),   
• Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic tool string, and   
• Petrospec spool-in TCMT.  

After recording a temperature of $40^{\circ}C$ at the bottom of the hole (stationary measurement time of $15\;\mathrm{min}$ ) with the ETBS memory tool, we lowered the $600~\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool on the core line to a dept h of ${\sim}433$ mbsf but did not recover a fluid sample because the valve s failed to close completely. We then raised the end of drill string to  a logging depth of 67.1 mbsf, lowered the triple combo tool strin g into the hole, and performed a calibration pass and full logging ru n from a debris fill at 442 mbsf to the seafloor. This run was followe d by two logging passes with the FMS-sonic tool string from 442 mbs f to just below the end of the pipe at 51.8 mbsf. We then lowered th e end of the drill string to 416.2 mbsf and obtained a borehole flui d sample with the $600~\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool. Finally, the third-part y TCMT was deployed on the wireline and, with the temperaturesensitive TCMT data logger kept inside the drill string, the tw o thermocouple joints were lowered $8\;\mathrm{m}$ past the end of the drill pip e and held at 447 mbsf for $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ . This first test of the newly designe d high-temperature TCMT recorded a temperature of $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . This tes t completed our operations at Site U1530. In total, $184.1\ h,$ or 7. 7 days, were spent at Site U1530.  

# Principal results  

Five igneous units were identified at Site U1530 (Figure F17). Igneous Unit 1 (0–26.62 mbsf) consists of clast-supported polymic t lapillistone with occasional blocks and bombs. Clasts are volcanic i n origin and reside in a matrix of altered, smaller volcanic fragment s and secondary minerals. Igneous Unit 2 $\left(30.70{-}59.62\ \mathrm{mbsf}\right)$ consists of a sequence of altered tuffaceous mudstone, siltstone, an d sandstone, with one subordinate horizon of polymict lapillistone, and is divided into five subunits (2a–2e) based on color, grain size, and internal structures. Unit 2 displays various sedimentary textures including normal and reverse grading as well as horizontal, wavy, lenticular, and inclined bedding, indicating transport, depositional, and soft-sediment deformation events. Igneous Unit  3 (59.62–64.40 mbsf) consists of altered plagioclase-phyric lava wit h pseudomorphs after glomerocrystic plagioclase. Igneous Unit  4 (64.40–218.21 mbsf) is a sequence of highly altered volcaniclasti c rocks with discernible monomict and polymict lapillistone an d monomict lapilli-tuff in the upper half that consists of altered volcanic clasts in a fine-grained, completely altered matrix. Significantl y pronounced alteration hinders detailed classification in the lowe r half of Unit 4. Igneous Unit 5 (222.70–448.68 mbsf) consists o f highly altered volcanic rocks with five discrete horizons of less altered plagioclase-phyric lava containing pseudomorphs after glomerocrystic plagioclase.

Figure F18. Distribution of alteration types and abundance of key minerals, Hole U1530A. Abundance is based on the mineral assemblages determined by XR D and thin section observations.  

Despite the pervasive alteration, the volcanic and volcaniclasti c rocks retain residual volcanic textures and original compositions o f alteration-resistant elements and ratios (Ti, Zr, and $\mathrm{Ti}/\mathrm{Zr})$ ), suggesting that the protolith was a typical Brothers volcano dacite. Simila r to the volcaniclastic rocks of Igneous Unit 2 in Hole U1527C, Hol e U1530A rocks appear to have the same systematically lower $\mathrm{Ti}/\mathrm{Zr}$ ratio compared to volcanic rocks at Sites U1528 and U1529. Although this disparity is small compared to the overall range observed in Kermadec arc lavas, it points toward slight geneti c variability among the Brothers volcano dacitic magma series.  

Five distinct alteration types were identified based on alteratio n mineral assemblage in core material recovered from Hole U1530 A (Figure F18). All alteration types occur at various intervals downhole, overprinting each other, and therefore do not correlate wit h certain depth intervals.  

Figure F19. Representative alteration types in hand specimens, Hole U1530A. A. Type I: blue-gray illite-rich clasts crosscut by a network of pyrite-anhydritesilica veins with a mesh texture. B. Type II: sediment with fine-grained, subhorizontal laminations that are subsequently cut by a vuggy anhydrite vein. C. Subtype IIIa: subrounded to subangular light gray clasts in a gray silicified matrix. D. Subtype IIIb: variably silicified blue-gray clasts exhibiting extensiv e resorption in a matrix of pyrite intergrown with quartz, with the occasional vug infilled with anhydrite. E. Type IV: homogeneous gray matrix with poorly distinguishable clasts containing patchy pyrophyllite and abundant vugs infilled with quartz and anhydrite. F. Type V: mottled equigranular rock with a clear distinction between light gray quartz-dominated and dark gray diaspore-pyrophyllite–rich areas.

Alteration Type I, classified as highly to intensely altered, has a n alteration mineral assemblage of opal, smectite, pyrite, anhydrite, sphalerite, and barite with minor quartz, chlorite, and illite (Figur e F19A). A network of anhydrite-barite veins with fine- to mediumgrained sphalerite cuts blue-gray lapillistone. The clasts are variabl y altered/silicified, and the contacts between clasts and matrix ar e distinct. Anhydrite is most abundant in veins and only rarely infill s vugs within clasts. In one sample, an acicular mineral, most likel y natroalunite, is observed microscopically cutting anhydrite-pyritesilica veins but was not detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.  

Alteration Type II, classified as intensely altered, has a characteristic green-gray color and an alteration mineral assemblage o f quartz, illite, and chlorite with variable amounts of anhydrite, pyrite, and smectite (Figure F19B). Type II is associated with thre e distinct lithologies throughout the hole: tuffaceous fine-graine d sediments, coherent lavas, and pyroclastic rocks. The abundance o f individual alteration minerals varies with lithology. For example, pyrite is more abundant in fine-grained sediments compared to pyroclastic  rocks.  The  fine-grained  tuffaceous  sediment  interva l (Igneous Unit 2) is frequently cut by coarse-grained vuggy anhydrit e veins. The altered lava unit exhibits a vuggy texture, and the vug s are filled with quartz, anhydrite, and minor pyrite. Chlorite and illite are intergrown with microcrystalline quartz, forming a homogeneous matrix. The upper volcaniclastic interval (Igneous Unit 1) i s characterized by subangular clasts that are visually distinguishabl e from matrix material. Clasts are rich in chlorite and illite relative t o the silica- and pyrite-rich matrix. Plagioclase is completely pseudomorphed by chlorite, quartz, and occasionally smectite.  

Alteration Type III, classified as intensely altered, is characterized by an alteration mineral assemblage of quartz and illite wit h minor smectite, anhydrite, and chlorite. This alteration type is divided into two subtypes (IIIa and IIIb) based on relative abundance s of anhydrite (enriched in Subtype IIIa) and chlorite (enriched i n Subtype IIIb). Subtype IIIa is white-gray and consists of well-defined pyroclastic texture with soft illite-rich clasts within a silica - and pyrite-rich matrix (Figure F19C). Subtype IIIb is blue-gray, an d both matrix and clasts are intensely silicified (Figure F19D). Pyrit e occurs as a minor phase disseminated throughout. Fe oxyhydroxid e is likely derived from pyrite oxidization. Magnetite is an accessor y phase and is frequently partially resorbed and overprinted by pyrite.  

Alteration Type IV, classified as intensely altered, is light gra y and has a mineral assemblage of pyrophyllite, quartz, illite, an d smectite with minor pyrite and rutile (Figure F19E). Clasts ar e poorly defined and strongly resorbed. Pyrophyllite is patchy and intergrown with illite and disseminated fine-grained anhydrite an d likely represents the core of relict clasts. Quartz is intergrown wit h illite and forms discrete veins associated with subhedral pyrite. Common leucoxene and minor rutile form ${<}0.1\ \mathrm{mm}$ grains and ar e variably overprinted by pyrite.  

Alteration Type V is buff colored and occurs as two distinct textures: fine-grained homogeneous material and coarse-grained equigranular material with a mottled texture (Figure F19F). Bot h textures exhibit the same alteration mineral assemblage of diaspore,

Salinities measured near the seawater line may be due to condensation from  a supercritical NaCl vapor. Hypersaline brine salinities above the NaCl saturation curve may be caused by boiling (bc1) or a NaCl brine with additiona l major cations such as K (line NK).

quartz, pyrophyllite, smectite, and rutile with minor illite, pyrite, and anhydrite. Fe oxyhydroxide staining is well developed throughout this alteration type, and pyrite is absent in some samples. Vug s are abundant and commonly infilled with chalcedony and anhydrite; the latter fills the core of the vugs. Anhydrite occurs in tw o distinct generations: coarse euhedral grains that infill vugs an d veins and a fine-grained subhedral to euhedral form intergrow n within the matrix. Rutile occurs in traces, mantled or overprinte d by pyrite.  

Unlike veins in Hole U1528D, most veins in Hole U1530A ar e sealed with anhydrite $^+$ sulfides $^+$ quartz, and only a few vugs ar e partly filled by drusy quartz or anhydrite that may record the lates t fluid compositions and temperatures. All fluid inclusions are twophase and homogenize to the liquid phase at $209^{\circ}$ to $390^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{:}$ , excep t for one $(406~\mathrm{mbsf})$ that exhibits critical-point behavior at $345\mathrm{^\circC}$ . The highest homogenization temperatures are measured in Alteration Types V (key minerals are pyrophyllite $^+$ diaspore) and II (ke y minerals are illite $^+$ chlorite). By contrast, the lowest median temperature of $255^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ was determined at 291 mbsf. The salinities o f fluid inclusions plot into two separate regions: at or near seawate r compositions and as a hypersaline brine at or along the $\mathtt{N a C l}$ saturation curve (Figure F20). Only Alteration Types II and V can be associated  with  hypersaline  brines.  The  fluid  inclusion  data  ar e consistent with two different fluids being responsible for the alteration assemblages: a pervasive fluid of modified seawater composition that has been heated to about $390^{\circ}C$ and a hypersaline brin e heated to $288^{\circ}{-}390^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Figure F20).  

Structures in Hole U1530A consist of volcanic fabrics, alteratio n veins, fractures, and sedimentary boundaries. Sedimentary boundaries, defined by changes in grain size and/or texture, are all subhorizontal $(<\!10^{\circ})$ . Volcanic fabrics are in two forms: within volcani c clasts or within coherent lava. In both forms, the fabric is defined b y vesicles and plagioclase microlites. Volcanic fabrics within clast s can be weak to strong but do not share a common orientation acros s clasts. This type of fabric is observed in the uppermost half of Hol e U1530A in lapilli-tuffs defining Igneous Units 1 and 4. Moderate t o strong volcanic fabrics that occur over decimeters define Igneou s Units 3 and 5, which consist of lavas. Volcanic fabrics within the lavas tend to be moderate to steep, with dips ${\tt>}45^{\circ}$ .  

Alteration veins occur throughout the hole and are typicall y filled with anhydrite, silica, and/or pyrite. Vein density is variabl e downhole, and the highest density relates to the presence of network veins, typically filled with pyrite or silica. The largest abundance in network veins is at the very top of the hole, from 0 to 2 5 mbsf. Discrete veins are most abundant at ${\sim}70$ and ${\sim}270$ mbsf. These depths also correspond to a large range in vein dip $(0^{\circ}-90^{\circ})_{\mathrm{:}}$ , an increase in vein thickness, and at ${\sim}270$ mbsf a deviation in borehole temperature. These depth intervals are also related to change s in igneous rock type between sediments and lavas above lapilli-tuf f at ${\sim}70$ mbsf and a change from lapilli-tuff to lava at ${\sim}270$ mbsf. Th e presence of sedimentary and volcanic rocks, the large range in vei n dip and thickness, and a deviation in borehole temperature may indicate the presence of lateral flow zones related to permeability contrasts. Fractures are less abundant compared with veins but ar e more common than at any other site. Fractures have a large range i n dip and are more frequent at ${\sim}55$ and ${\sim}255~\mathrm{mbsf},$ which is coincident with zones of more abundant veins. Slickenlines were identified from $\mathord{\sim}190$ to 290 mbsf and typically have steep rakes and  a normal sense of shear.  

All hard rock samples from Site U1530 show various degrees o f hydrothermal alteration, as confirmed by petrographic description s and analysis via XRD and ICP-AES/portable X-ray fluorescenc e (pXRF). Despite pervasive alteration, the volcanic and volcaniclasti c rocks have retained original chemical compositions of alteration-resistant elements and ratios (Ti, Zr, and $\mathrm{Ti}/\mathrm{Zr})$ ) that suggest th e protolith was a typical Brothers volcano dacite. Relative to Sit e U1528 and U1529 rocks that have a $\mathrm{Ti/Zr}$ value of ${\sim}36.$ , Hol e U1530A and U1527C volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks appear t o share the slightly but systematically lower $\mathrm{Ti}/\mathrm{Zr}$ value of ${\sim}27$ . Although this disparity is smaller than the overall range observed i n Kermadec arc lava $(\mathrm{Ti}/\mathrm{Zr}\leq220)$ , it points to slight genetic variability among the Brothers volcano dacitic magma series. For a larg e range of alteration-sensitive elements, the recovered rocks displa y strong geochemical changes and major loss of Mn, Ca, and Na (Figure F21). The observed downhole variations of major oxides an d trace elements are much more pronounced at Site U1530 than at Sit e U1527, including the extensive loss of $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ relative to unaltere d dacites recovered at Sites U1527 and U1529. Other alkali elements, such as potassium $\left(\mathrm{K_{2}O}\right)$ and the alkaline-earth metals (Mg, Ca, Sr , and Ba), show both depletions and enrichments relative to fres h dacites. The strongest geochemical shifts in Hole U1530A occur a t 189–191 mbsf, where a decrease in $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O},$ , Ba, Y, and Cu concentrations corresponds to the transition from Alteration Type III to I V and the disappearance of illite and first appearance of pyrophyllite. Alteration Types IV and V in Igneous Unit 5 form two importan t end-members and display the strongest depletions in Mg, Ba, Sr, Fe, Cu, and $Z\mathfrak{n}$ . The reverse pattern is seen in Alteration Type I in Igneous Unit 1, suggesting that some of the loss of elements observed a t the bottom of the hole may partially be balanced by a gain of thes e elements in the upper part of the hole. Depletions in $C\mathsf{a O}$ are associated with higher $\operatorname{Sr}$ concentrations and the identification of anhydrite by XRD, suggesting that the abundance of $C a O$ is mainl y controlled by the occurrence of anhydrite. Principally hosted in barite, Ba at Site U1530 ranges from trace levels of about $20~\upmu\mathrm{g/g}$ i n Alteration Types IV and V to very high abundances of about $3~\mathrm{wt\%}$ in Alteration Type I. A pronounced correlation was observed between total S and Fe concentrations throughout Hole U1530A, suggesting that pyrite represents the primary form of S in the roc k (predominantly in Igneous Units 1, 2, and 4). Significant enrichments in $Z\mathrm{n}\left(\le5.2\;\mathrm{wt\%}\right)$ , $\mathrm{Cu}\left({\tt s}1760\;\mathrm{ppm}\right)$ , As $(\le\!660\;\mathrm{ppm})$ , Pb $(\le\!100$ ppm), and Mo $\langle{\le}560\ \mathrm{ppm}\rangle$ were also recorded in pyrite-rich intervals, consistent with high-temperature hydrothermal fluid contributions.

Figure F21. Variations in major element oxides in altered volcaniclastic rocks and lavas, Hole U1530A. Average values for fresh dacites recovered from Hol e U1527A and at Site U1529 are shown with dashed vertical lines representing 2σ from average values.  

TC content in the majority of Hole U1530A samples ar e ${<}200\,\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{g}$ and are lower overall than TC content at Sites U1527– U1529. An average total sulfur content at Site U1530 of $5.1~\mathrm{wt\%}$ i s similar to the $5.9\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ average at Site U1528. In contrast to Sit e U1528, total sulfur content decreases with depth from ${\sim}11$ to ${\sim}3.5$ $\mathrm{wt\%}$ , on average.  

Pore space dissolved gases, including $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ , CO, $\mathrm{{CH}_{4}}$ , $\mathrm{C_{2}H_{6}},$ $\Sigma C\mathrm{O}_{2},$ and acid-volatile S, were analyzed from several intervals of the recovered cores in Hole U1530A. As reported at Sites U1527–U1529, pore space dissolved $\mathrm{C_{2}H_{6}}$ concentrations were below detectio n limit $(<\!0.03\ \upmu\mathrm{mol/L})$ for all depths in Hole U1530A. Five interval s with elevated $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ $\mathrm{\Deltal_{2},\ C H_{4},\Sigma C O_{2}},$ and acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) concentrations were detected. Maximum pore fluid AVS and $\Sigma{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ concentrations of 1.6 and $37\;\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , respectively, are similar to thos e previously determined by de Ronde et al. (2011) for actively ventin g chimneys of the NW Caldera vent field and may originate from fluids rich in magmatic volatiles.  

A fluid sample was collected with the $600~\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool a t 435 mbsf. The in situ fluid temperature was estimated to be ${\sqrt{38^{\circ}C}}$ based on downhole temperature logging. The borehole fluid sampl e is slightly acidic relative to seawater $\left(\mathrm{pH}\,6.8\right)$ and is characterized b y the same major and minor species composition (i.e., dissolved Na, K, Ca, Sr, Mg, Cl, Br, and $\Sigma{\mathrm{SO}}_{4}$ ) as drilling fluid (surface seawater) withi n analytical error. Dissolved $\Sigma\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ concentration is below detectio n limit. The concentrations of several metal species are highly elevate d above seawater values and are likely derived from contamination b y the steel bit and drill string or the $600\,\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool itself.  

The NRM of 81 archive halves from Hole U1530A was measured using the cryogenic superconducting rock magnetomete r (SRM). The overprint magnetization from drilling and coring wa s reduced by using the in-line AF demagnetizer. Detailed measurements of anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), AF and thermal demagnetization, and IRM experiments on 65 discrete oriente d samples were also conducted (four from Igneous Unit 1, five fro m Igneous Unit 2, two from Igneous Unit 3, twenty-four from Igneou s Unit 4, and thirty from Igneous Unit 5). Magnetic directions for discrete samples show relatively shallow inclinations compared wit h  

Sites U1527 and U1528. In particular, three samples from Igneou s Unit 2 (Core 376-U1530A-10R to Core 11R; 50–55 mbsf) show consistent positive inclinations, confirmed by corresponding piece s measured in the cryogenic magnetometer. The NRM intensities an d magnetic susceptibilities also highlight relative differences betwee n the various igneous units. For example, Igneous Unit 1 is characterized by low NRM intensities, low coercivities, and erratic therma l demagnetization curves. Igneous Units 2 and 4 are characterized b y very low NRM intensities with complex AF and thermal demagnetization curves but larger coercivities. Igneous Units 3 and 5 have lo w NRM intensities, low-to-medium magnetic coercivities, and relatively simple AF and thermal demagnetization curves with a mino r overprint from drilling. Igneous Units 1, 2, and 4 also show increases of NRM intensity after heating to temperatures $>\!400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , suggesting irreversible transformation of the original magnetic minerals during heating.  

Variations of physical properties at Site U1530 show good correlations with defined igneous units and subunits but correlate les s well with transitions in alteration types. Igneous Unit 1, which corresponds to Alteration Type I, contains the peak values for magneti c susceptibility and NGR at the site. NGR peaks are also recorded b y downhole measurements with the Hostile Environment Natura l Gamma Ray Sonde (HNGS) and are an order of magnitude highe r than those recorded at the other Brothers volcano drill sites, whic h is attributed to radioactive U-series isotopes in the sulfide and barite veins observed at this depth.  

Transitions between and within igneous units and subunits ar e clearly defined by variations in bulk density, porosity, and $P$ -wav e velocity. These data do not show strong correlation with structura l features such as fractures or alteration veins. Observed variations i n magnetic susceptibility and thermal conductivity do not correspon d clearly to the observed abundance or distribution of particular minerals, but a large increase in magnetic susceptibility from Igneou s Unit 4 to 5 is evident.  

Overall, physical property data define two intervals of markedl y different characteristics: $\mathord{\sim}30$ to ${\sim}35\$ mbsf in Igneous Unit 2 and ${\sim}75$ to ${\sim}85$ mbsf in Igneous Unit 4. These intervals are characterized b y high grain density, low bulk density, and high porosity. They als o correspond to increased concentrations of $\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}}$ S, trace metals, and metalloids and are located directly beneath intervals characterized by increased fracture density and wide ranges in alteration vei n dip angles. These intervals may therefore be important for understanding the past fluid–rock interactions and flow pathways of th e hydrothermal system at Site U1530.  

Multiple borehole temperature measurements obtained ove r the downhole logging period indicated that the hole had warme d from ${\sim}35^{\circ}$ to $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at ${\sim}430$ mbsf during the first $^{5\mathrm{~h~}}$ after stoppin g circulation and then had cooled to $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ during the subsequent $^{10\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ . The temperature profile shows a gradual increase in temperatur e with depth, indicative of a largely conductive-dominated regime i n the borehole, and also displays a concave-upward shape suggestiv e of recharge into the formation. Thermal anomalies in the temperature profiles observed between 255 and 295 mbsf may indicate  a permeable flow zone. This interval is also characterized by the highest number of veins with a large range in vein dip and a higher abundance of fractures, suggesting structural control for this permeabl e zone. Downhole caliper measurements showed an overall comparatively large borehole diameter partially exceeding the measurabl e $43.2\;\mathrm{cm}$ (17 inches), with a minimum of $24.0~\mathrm{{cm}}$ (9.5 inches) and  a median of $41.1\,\mathrm{cm}$ (16.2 inches). Downhole NGR measurements reveal high U-series isotopes between 23 and 35 mbsf, correlating wel l with high values measured on the recovered core and most likel y related to barite identified by XRD analysis. High potassium concentration corresponds to Alteration Types II and III, both of whic h contain abundant illite. Downhole density and porosity measurements are in good agreement with discrete core measurements. Th e depth interval between 70 and 85 mbsf in Igneous Unit 4 and Subtype IIIa alteration has low bulk density and resistivity and high porosity from both discrete and downhole measurements.  

In total, 18 whole-round samples $_{5-11\,\mathrm{cm}}$ long) were collecte d from Hole U1530A for microbiological analysis (Table T2). Sample s were processed for shore-based DNA and RNA analyses, cell and viral counting, and viral and microbial activity measurements. PFM D was used for contamination testing and was usually detected on th e outside of uncleaned cores and, on rare occasions, was above detection limit on the cleaned outside of cores. However, concentration s of PFMD in drilling fluid samples were much lower than the expected 500 ppb values. Based on the results, the decision was mad e to increase the PFMD tracer pumping rate by a factor of 10 at th e next drill site (U1531) and to collect drilling fluid from every core.  

# Site U1531  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1531 (proposed alternate Site LC-1A) is located on th e saddle between the Lower and Upper Cones of Brothers volcan o (Figure F6). This site likely sits between the margins of the upflo w zones of both the Upper and Lower Cones because there is no detectable low crustal magnetization in this area. The Lower Cone hydrothermal vent field includes vents that discharge the most Fe- an d Mg-rich fluids sampled at Brothers volcano to date, although ther e is no evidence for venting at the saddle. The main objective of Sit e U1531 was to drill and core to $\mathord{\sim}300$ mbsf to sample the various volcanic cycles that compose the Lower Cone as well as to intersect th e upflow zone of metal-rich fluids.  

# Operations  

We implemented operations in five holes at Site U1531 (Tabl e T1). Holes U1531A, U1531B, and U1531E were drilled on the saddle stretching between the Lower and Upper Cone of Brothers volcano. Holes U1531C and U1531D were established on the summi t of the Lower Cone. Hole U1531A is located at $34^{\circ}52.7767^{\prime}\mathrm{S},$ $179^{\circ}4.2241^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $1354.9\mathrm{~m~}$ . In this hole, we conducted RCB coring from the seafloor to 15 mbsf, with poor recover y of $1.0\textrm{m}(7\%)$ . Further advancement was impossible because of extremely poor hole conditions that led to a stuck drill string several times. In Hole U1531B, located at $34^{\circ}52.7721\,^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}4.2111^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at  a water depth of $1351.9\;\mathrm{m}$ , RCB coring penetrated from the seafloo r to 26 mbsf and recovered $4.0\;\mathrm{m}$ $(15\%)$ . However, poor hole conditions in blocky/fragmented lava deposits prevented us from furthe r deepening the hole. We offset the vessel ${\sim}110\ \mathrm{m}$ northeastward t o the summit of the Lower Cone to Hole U1531C at $34^{\circ}52.7239^{\prime}\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $179^{\circ}4.2586^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $1306.9\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Here, we RCB core d from the seafloor to 28.4 mbsf and recovered $2.3\textrm{m}(8\%)$ , with tigh t hole conditions throughout coring. We thus abandoned Hol e U1531C at 28.4 mbsf.  

We then decided to deploy a reentry system with a short $16~\mathrm{m}$ long casing string to establish a stable hole for reaching deeper coring and logging objectives. We drilled in casing in Hole U1531D a t $34^{\circ}52.7228^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}4.2606^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $1306.9\;\mathrm{m}$ at the summit of the Lower Cone. After the pilot bit drilled to the target dept h of 19 mbsf, we released the reentry system from the drilling assembly (mud motor, underreamer, and drill bit), but we were unable t o pull the drilling assembly clear of the casing string because th e underreamer arms did not completely retract. After several hours o f attempting to free the reentry system, we started pulling the dril l string and attached reentry system out of the hole and back to th e vessel. While we were retrieving the casing reentry system assembly, it unfortunately dropped off in sight of the moonpool, with ou r position above the bottom part of Lower Cone slope in its transitio n to the surrounding southeastern caldera floor.  

We then moved back to the saddle between the Lower and Upper Cone and made up another drilling assembly to drill-in $16\;\mathrm{m}$ o f casing in Hole U1531E located at $34^{\circ}52.7591\,^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}4.2344^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at  a water depth of $1350.4\;\mathrm{m}$ . We drilled-in the casing to 17.9 mbsf. W e then conducted another test of the CDEX TDCS and washed dow n (drilled without coring) to 17.9 mbsf to start coring in Hole U1531E. We could not advance any deeper because the TDCS core barrel go t stuck in the BHA and could not be retrieved. After the TDCS test, we cored with the RCB system from 17.9 to 39.6 mbsf and recovere d only $0.8\mathrm{~m~}(4\%)$ . At this point, the blower motor in the top driv e failed. We decided not to repair it at this time because of our remaining scientific priorities and the approaching end of the expedition. Our final operation at Site U1531 consisted of a downhol e temperature measurement with the ETBS memory tool. It recorde d a maximum temperature of ${\sim}5^{\circ}C$ at 20 mbsf. In total, $264.3~\mathrm{h},$ o r 11.0 days, were spent at Site U1531.  

# Principal results  

At Site U1531, one igneous unit is observed in Holes U1531 A $(0{-}1.14~\mathrm{mbsf})$ , U1531B (0–21.97 mbsf), U1531C (0–23.75 mbsf), and U1531E (17.90–34.95 mbsf) and in several ghost cores fro m Hole U1531E. Igneous Unit 1 consists of unaltered to slightly altered plagioclase-pyroxene-phyric dacite lava intercalated with unconsolidated ash, ash with lapilli, and lapilli tephra with ash. Th e moderately to highly vesicular dacite lava contain glomerocryst s and phenocrysts of plagioclase, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti oxides in cryptocrystalline and hypocrystalline groundmass. Volcaniclastic material is mainly composed of unaltered dacite  clasts,  crystals,  and  subordinate  lithic  components.  Th e composition of the dacite lava and pyroclastic rocks at Site U1531 i s typical for those of the youngest dacitic magmas erupted at Brothers volcano.  

Based on the alteration mineral assemblage, one alteration typ e was identified at Site U1531. Alteration Type I, classified as slightl y altered, has an alteration mineral assemblage of smectite, Fe oxyhydroxide, zeolite, pyrite, and rarely native S. Alteration occurs a s infilling and lining of vesicles as well as smectite replacing the glass y matrix.  

The main structures at Site U1531 include volcanic fabrics an d fractures. Volcanic fabrics ranging from weak to strong were observed in all holes. Only three depth intervals across Site U1531 ar e structurally isotropic. Fabrics are defined by elongated vesicles, plagioclase microlites, and subordinate plagioclase phenocrysts an d glomerocrysts. Vesicles have aspect ratios between 5 and 15. Hol e U1531C is the only hole where fabric orientation was measured. Fabric dips range from moderate to steep. A few pieces in Hol e U1531C have lineations defined by vesicles; all plunges are subparallel to the dip. Several core pieces from all holes have microfractures delineated by the growth of halite and gypsum after piece s were cut and dried. Discrete fractures are best preserved in Hol e U1531C. Fractures range from shallow to steep and are typicall y marked by secondary minerals such as native sulfur or Fe oxyhydroxide.  

Unaltered to slightly altered lavas and tephra from Igneous Uni t 1 represent typical dacites, with $62.3–65.0\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ \mathrm{Si}$ $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Na_{2}O\ +}$ $\mathrm{K_{2}O}$ content ranging from 6.5 to $6.9\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ . The dacites are essentiall y similar in major and trace element composition to fresh dacites a t Site U1529 and Hole U1527A (Igneous Unit 1) and confirm the lo w compositional range previously reported for dacites at Brothers volcano. TC and total sulfur contents are generally low ( $<\!250$ and $<\!300$ $\mathsf{\Sigma}\mathsf{\Sigma}\mathsf{\Sigma}\mathsf{\Sigma}\mathsf{\Sigma}\mathsf{\Sigma}\mathsf{\Sigma}\mathsf{\Sigma}\,,$ respectively) except in one sample with $\mathrm{T}\mathrm{C}\approx1900\;\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{g}.$ . Lo w total sulfur is consistent with previously reported data for daciti c glass at Brothers volcano, suggesting minimal influence of magmati c volatile input in the selected samples. However, the detection of relatively high concentrations of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and AVS in some intervals is consistent with discharging magmatic gases through the volcanic pile.  

Only three core sections recovered from Site U1531 (i.e., Hol e U1531C) had oriented pieces that could be measured in the cryogenic SRM. In addition, we selected five discrete samples from th e working halves for detailed measurements of AMS, AF and thermal demagnetization, and IRM experiments. As expected from fres h dacites, NRM intensities are large. Magnetic directions from thes e samples have inclinations of approximately $-60^{\circ}$ , suggesting a ver y young age for the primary magnetization component. The shape o f the thermal demagnetization curve indicates that these sample s contain pure magnetite and titanomagnetite with variable Ti content.  

Physical property measurements made on limited fragmente d core samples recovered from Holes U1531A–U1531C and U1531 E are consistent with the range of expected values for fresh dacite lav a and tephra and are similar to those for fresh volcaniclastic material from Igneous Unit 1 at corresponding Sites U1527–U1529. No clea r difference in physical properties is evident between material recovered from the summit of the Lower Cone and material recovere d from the saddle, although interpretation is significantly limited b y the low recovery, fragmented nature of the core, and limited number of oriented pieces.  

The ETBS memory tool was deployed in Hole U1531E afte r ${\sim}24\,\mathrm{h}$ without circulation. It recorded a maximum temperature o f $5.2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at 20 mbsf, which is similar to the bottom seawater temperature.  

One whole-round sample of moderately vesicular dacite lav a was collected from Hole U1531C for microbiological analysis (Tabl e T2). Sample aliquots were taken and preserved for shore-base d DNA and RNA analyses, as well as prokaryotic and viral countin g and activity measurements.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 376 was designed to provide the missing link (i.e., th e third dimension) in our understanding of hydrothermal activity an d mineral deposit formation at submarine arc volcanoes and the relationship between the discharge of magmatic fluids and the deep biosphere. The drill sites targeted areas considered to be hydrotherma l upflow zones of geochemically distinct fluids that are variably affected by magmatic volatile input, thus allowing us to directly addres s the consequences of magma degassing for metal transport to the seafloor and its effect on the functioning of microbial communities.  

Expedition 376 completed five sites: two (Sites U1527 an d U1530) within the NW Caldera seawater-dominated hydrothermal field, two (Sites U1528 and U1531) within the Upper and Lowe r Cone magmatic fluid–influenced hydrothermal fields, and one (Sit e U1529) in an area of low crustal magnetization that delineates th e W Caldera upflow zone. Although three of these sites were original primary sites and one (Site U1531) an original alternate site, Sit e U1530 was added during the expedition. This addition was neede d because we encountered much thicker than expected loose, unconsolidated volcanic gravels, sands, and ash-like material that cause d significant drilling difficulties early in the expedition, particularl y for Site U1529 on the caldera floor; Hole U1529B collapsed afte r only ${\sim}34\,\mathrm{m}$ of penetration. Hence, we sought and obtained approva l to move an alternate caldera floor site to a new location on a benc h on the NW Caldera wall (Site U1530) to minimize the likelihood o f an overburden of unconsolidated volcaniclastic material.  

Expedition 376 used rotary coring for most sites, but it als o tested a prototype TDCS developed by Japan Agency for MarineEarth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) in Holes U1528C an d U1531E. Drilling was extremely successful, coring $1244\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovering $222.4\mathrm{~m~}$ of core. This is almost four times the recover y achieved during ODP Leg 158 (TAG hydrothermal field, Mid-Atlantic Ridge; Herzig, Humphris, Miller, and Zierenberg, 1998) an d almost three times that of Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 19 3 (PACMANUS hydrothermal field, Eastern Manus Basin; Barriga, Binns, Miller, and Herzig, 2007), which represent the two previou s endeavors with volcanic rock–hosted hydrothermal systems a s drilling targets. Important to the success of Expedition 376 was th e use of drill-in casing, which provided stability in the volcaniclasti c deposits encountered in the upper part of some holes. Overall, recovery averaged $18\%$ for Expedition 376 (cf. $13\%$ for Leg 158 an d $11\%$ for Leg 193) and varied between $1\%$ (Hole U1527A) and $29\%$ (Hole U1528D), depending on the hole conditions and lithologie s encountered. Downhole measurements and borehole fluid sampling were conducted in Holes U1528D, U1530A, and U1531E. Given the low and variable recovery, the downhole logs from Site s U1528 and U1530 will be extremely helpful postexpedition in th e interpretation of the rock record.  

We expect that integration of the shipboard data with postexpedition shore-based analyses will result in significant progres s toward addressing all four of the primary scientific objectives outlined in the Expedition 376 Scientific Prospectus (de Ronde et al., 2017):  

1. Characterize the subvolcano, magma chamber–derived volatile phase to test model-based predictions that this is either a singlephase gas or two-phase brine-vapor.  

Hole U1528D penetrated $359.3\;\mathrm{m}$ through the center of the Upper Cone, beginning at the floor of a pit crater at its summit. Muc h of the core recovered from this hole smelled strongly of $\mathrm{H}_{2}S_{:}$ , and  a mineral assemblage of illite $^+$ natroalunite $^+$ pyrophyllite $^+$ quartz $^+$ opal $^+$ pyrite attests to acid-sulfate fluids derived from the disproportionation of magmatic gases, such as $S\mathrm{O}_{2}$ . Headspace gas analyses confirm relatively high levels of AVS (as much as $20\,\mathrm{mmol/L}$ nea r the bottom of the hole) and $\Sigma{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (as much as $182\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$ ). Th e effects of strong acid on the host rock are also reflected in the geochemical data, which indicate extreme depletion of major elements, such as $\mathrm{MgO_{\mathrm{{.}}}}$ , $\mathrm{K_{2}O},$ and $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ . Furthermore, very acid $\mathrm{pH}$ as low a s 1.8), relatively hot $(\leq\!247^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ fluids collected by the $600~\mathrm{mL}$ Kuste r FTS tool at 160, 279, and 313 mbsf have compositions that are indicative of significant magmatic gas input. In addition, preliminar y fluid inclusion results provide evidence for two dominant fluids having transgressed the Upper Cone: a hot $({\leq}340^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ hydrothermal flui d of modified-seawater origin that appears to have undergone phas e separation and a hot $(\le\!360^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ hypersaline brine that may be transporting metals, given the observation of sulfide daughter crystal s (together with halite) in some of the inclusions. The highest fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures are coincident with a hightemperature acidic alteration mineral assemblage of natroalunite $^+$ pyrophyllite $^+$ opal, indicating temperatures of ${\geq}230^{\circ}C$ (e.g., Reyes, 1990). These results clearly show brine-vapor conditions occurrin g within the Upper Cone site at Brothers volcano.  

Hole U1531E penetrated $39.6~\mathrm{m}$ into the southwest flank of th e Lower Cone immediately east of the saddle between the lowe r flanks of the Upper and Lower Cones. Cores recovered from thi s hole are largely fresh lavas with only incipient low-temperature alteration, although native S coating the walls of small fractures indicates  limited  interaction  with  magmatic  volatiles  and/o r hydrothermal fluids. However, the observation of extensive diffus e venting of gassy, very acidic fluids emanating from and surroundin g the summit of the Lower Cone (de Ronde et al., 2011) implies tha t magmatic degassing must be restricted to narrow upflow zones.  

Further shore-based studies, including additional analyses of th e borehole fluids and more extensive fluid inclusion studies, will hel p constrain the characteristics of the fluids within the Upper Cone hydrothermal system and allow us to test models of the subsurfac e hydrologic regimes at Brothers volcano.  

2. Explore the subseafloor distribution of base and precious metals and metalloids and the reactions that have taken place along pathways to the seafloor.  

Holes U1527C and U1530A are located in different parts of th e NW Caldera hydrothermal vent field. The former is on the wester n margin of the field atop the caldera rim, and the latter is on the caldera wall. Hole U1527C was drilled to 238 mbsf and penetrate d variably altered volcaniclastic rocks and coherent lavas of daciti c composition. The upper $185~\mathrm{m}$ of Hole U1527C are dominated by  a mineral assemblage of goethite $^+$ opal $^+$ mordenite, which is indicative of relatively low temperature $(<\!150^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ alteration. This assemblage is replaced downhole by chlorite $^+$ quartz $^+$ illite $\pm$ smectite, and the lower parts of the hole are characterized by an assemblag e dominated by quartz $^+$ chlorite $^+$ pyrite $\pm$ illite. These assemblage s indicate alteration temperatures $>\!230^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Pyrite is the predominan t sulfide phase in Hole U1527C and is disseminated mainly in th e deeper chlorite $^+$ illite–rich part of the core.  

Hole U1530A was established proximal to a fault that exposes  a stockwork zone, where several centimeter-thick, metal-rich vein s form an anastomosing network within the altered host rock. Hol e U1530A was drilled to 453 mbsf through a sequence of altered volcaniclastics with intercalated coherent lavas and an interval of altered tuffaceous sediments. The upper ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{m}$ of core have a mineral assemblage of opal $^+$ smectite $^+$ chlorite $^+$ pyrite $^+$ barite $^+$ sphalerite, which is indicative of alteration temperatures of $100^{\circ}{-}250^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The occurrence of sphalerite and pyrite in close proximity to th e sulfate minerals along with the presence of a dense network of vein s averaging $0.2\;\mathrm{cm}$ in thickness and enrichment in metals and metalloids (Zn, As, Cu, Mo, Se, and Pb) is consistent with the proximity o f the hole to the exposed stockwork zone.  

This assemblage is replaced downhole by quartz $^+$ illite $^+$ chlorite $^+$ anhydrite, which points to alteration temperatures ${<}275^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ More acid $\mathrm{(pH<4)}$ and hotter $(250^{\circ}{-}300^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ fluids are implied eve n further downhole with the appearance of pyrophyllite deeper tha n $\mathord{\sim}190$ mbsf followed by a final assemblage of diaspore $^+$ quartz $^+$ pyrophyllite $^+$ rutile $\pm$ zunyite deeper than ${\sim}225$ mbsf. Two-phas e fluid inclusions (with and without daughter halite crystals) associated with the pyrophyllite- and diaspore-rich alteration assemblage s have homogenization temperatures of ${\sim}350^{\circ}{-}390^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Other inclusions are complex and contain various daughter minerals, includin g halite, sulfates, and other anisotropic minerals, with homogenization temperatures $>\!320^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Combined, the fluid inclusions are indicative of hypersaline brines like those seen in fluid inclusions a t Upper Cone Site U1528. Pyrite is the main proxy for metals in th e borehole and is distributed throughout the hole, although mor e abundant in the chlorite $^+$ illite–rich zones. The loss of K, Ba, Y, an d Cu deeper than $\mathord{\sim}190$ mbsf and an increase in the magnitude of depletion deeper than ${\sim}225$ mbsf, corresponding to the appearance o f pyrophyllite and diaspore, are also consistent with a downhole decrease in $\mathsf{p H}$ and increase in temperature (above ${\sim}250^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ ) of fluid– rock reaction. Later incursion and mixing of seawater and hydrothermal fluid that overprints earlier mineral assemblages resultin g from reaction with more acidic fluids is reflected in the increase d abundances of smectite, chlorite, and anhydrite in a later alteratio n event.  

The large variations observed in the alteration mineral assemblages encountered at Sites U1527, U1528, and U1530 clearly attes t to complex but distinct paragenetic sequences at both the NW Caldera and the Upper Cone hydrothermal fields. Interestingly, it appears  that  the  currently  seawater-dominated  NW  Calder a hydrothermal field may have undergone an earlier phase of reactions with acid-sulfate fluids, resulting in alteration assemblages resembling those observed in the Upper Cone. Further mineralogical, geochemical, and fluid inclusion shore-based studies will elucidat e the reactions that take place along pathways to the seafloor and th e distribution, transport, and fate of metals and metalloids within th e hydrothermal systems of Brothers volcano.  

3. Quantify the mechanisms and extent of fluid-rock interaction, the consequences for mass transfer of metals and metalloids into the ocean, and the role of magmatically derived carbon and sulfur species in mediating these fluxes.  

Fluid-rock reactions at Sites U1527, U1528, and U1530 have occurred under a range of conditions (i.e., temperature, pH, Eh, etc.), and hence quantifying mass transfer of elements into the ocean i s difficult, particularly given the heterogeneous lithologies encountered at all sites. The mineral assemblage of quartz $^+$ illite $^+$ chlorit e $^+$ anhydrite $\pm$ smectite in Holes U1527C and U1530A in the N W Caldera hydrothermal vent field clearly points to a complex exchange between a hydrothermal fluid of modified-seawater composition and the dacitic protolith. This is indicated by $\mathrm{Mg}$ and  S enrichment as well as both depletion and enrichment in K and Rb, respectively, in addition to relatively subtle changes in other majo r elements (normalized to the composition of unaltered dacitic lav a from Site U1527). These element exchanges are distinct from thos e observed in the mineral assemblage that is indicative of interactio n with hot acidic fluids (i.e., denoted by the assemblage of pyrophyllit e $^+$ diaspore $^+$ quartz $^+$ illite $\pm$ rutile) seen deeper in Hole U1530A, which shows strong depletions in K, Mg, Ca, Na, and Fe contents.  

In contrast, at the Upper Cone site, alteration and elemental exchange are affected by magmatic volatile–driven reactions. Magmatic gases (high concentrations of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ , $\Sigma C O_{2},$ and AVS wer e measured in headspace gas analyses) cool, condense, undergo disproportionation reactions involving $S O_{2},$ $\Sigma\mathrm{H}_{2}S.$ , and $\mathrm{{\Sigma}S O_{4},}$ and mi x with seawater as they ascend toward the seafloor. The resultin g acidic hydrothermal fluids strongly leach the rocks of the Uppe r Cone. The leaching leads to depletion of many major elements, including Mg, K, Na, Fe, Ca, and Mn, and enrichment in S (note tha t the loss of Fe may be related to interaction with a later-stage, sulfate-rich fluid). Fluid inclusion data from Hole U1528D suggest tha t most metals are likely still at depth, given the highly saline $33\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ equiv. NaCl) brines, with noticeable sulfide daughter minerals included. Active venting at the Upper and Lower Cone sites is testament to the flux of $\Sigma{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ , S, and Fe, in particular, into the overlyin g water column (de Ronde et al., 2011).  

Shore-based analyses will focus on more detailed geochemical , isotopic, and fluid inclusion studies to decipher the conditions of alteration, the sources of elements, and the elemental exchanges tha t accompany fluid–rock reactions.  

4. Assess the diversity, extent, and metabolic pathways of microbial life in an extreme, metal-toxic, and acidic volcanic environment  

The overarching objectives for microbiological studies for Expedition 376 focus on determining the biomass, activity, and community structure of subsurface microbial and viral communities usin g an array of microbiological applications. Whole-round samples collected for microbiological studies were subsampled for shore-base d analyses to explore the limits of microbial life and characterize th e microbial diversity (including Bacteria, Archaea, and viruses) usin g cultivation-based and cultivation-independent molecular biological approaches.  

Relatively few shipboard analyses were performed because mos t measurements require post-expedition studies in shore-based laboratories. First, detection of ATP was attempted on board to identif y signs of bacterial life in the rock samples. However, detection wa s not successful in most cases because of denaturation of the luciferase enzyme by compounds found within the retrieved material. Second, tracers were pumped into the drill string prior and during cor e recovery. Systematic sampling of the cored material and drilling fluids indicated that the interiors of the whole-round samples for microbiology are suitable for shore-based analyses.  

Postexpedition analyses will include an array of techniques:   
• Total cell counts to quantify microbial biomass,   
• DNA analysis of small-subunit ribosomal gene amplicon sequencing to address community structure,   
• Metagenomics analysis to reconstruct the metabolic potential and identify entire genomes from microbial populations in the samples,   
• Metatranscriptomics of total RNA to establish potential community activity (i.e., the genes that are most expressed in a given microbial environment),   
• Characterization of viral diversity using polymerase chain reaction and metagenomic approaches to identify the role of viruses in the ecosystem,   
• Metabolic activity measurements of microbial communities using stable isotope–labeled or radioactive isotope–labeled tracers to identify what kinds of major energy and carbon metabolisms are present, and   
• Enrichment of specific groups of organisms to identify the unique physiological properties of the organisms.
