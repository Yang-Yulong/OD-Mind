# Introduction  

This chapter documents the procedures and methods used fo r shipboard and shore-based measurements and analyses during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 370. During Expedition 370, we conducted riserless drilling to $1180.0\;\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth below seafloor (DSF) and collected 112 core sample s in IODP Hole C0023A. In order to meet the expedition goals, microbial cells and activities needed to be detected down to the detection limits of existing methods. Therefore, contamination contro l and quality assurance (QA) were of crucial importance. An extensive set of measurements was carried out on board the D/V Chikyu, and selected samples were transported to the Kochi Core Cente r (KCC) by helicopter for further analysis. All shipboard and shorebased scientists contributed to the completion of this volume.  

the top of the cored interval and curated length of the recovere d core. Core depths are converted to core depth below seafloor, Method B (CSF-B), in which overlapping sections are compresse d when recovery is ${>}100\%$ (see IODP Depth Scales Terminology a t http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines).  

The depths reported in DRF are converted to depths below seafloor (DSF or CSF-B) by subtracting water depth and the height o f the rig floor from the sea surface, with corrections relative to DR F where appropriate (Figure F1). DSF and CSF-B are therefore equivalent. In this report, core depth described in meters below seafloo r (mbsf) is equivalent to CSF-B. Seismic depths are reported in eithe r time (s) or depth $(\mathrm{m})$ . For time sections, a two-way traveltime (s ) scale is used below sea level. For depth sections, seismic depth below seafloor (SSF) or seismic depth below sea level (SSL) are expressed in meters.  

# Reference depths  

Depths of each measurement or sample are reported relative t o both the drilling vessel rig floor (rotary table) and the seafloor. These depths are determined by drill pipe length and are correlate d with each other by the use of distinct reference points. Drillin g engineers on the Chikyu refer to pipe length when reporting dept h and report this as drilling depth below rig floor (DRF) in meters. Core depths are based on the drilling depth below the rig floor t o  

# Site, hole, core, section, and sample numbering  

Sites drilled by the Chikyu are numbered consecutively from th e first site with a prefix $^\ast C$ ,” which indicates that the hole was drille d by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technolog y (JAMSTEC)/Center for Deep Earth Exploration (CDEX) platform. A site refers to one or more holes drilled while the ship is positione d within $300\;\mathrm{m}$ of the first hole. The first hole drilled at a given site i s assigned the site number modified by the suffix “A,” the second hol e

takes the site number and the suffix ${}^{\omega}\mathrm{B},{}^{\prime\prime}$ and so forth. These suffixe s are assigned regardless of recovery, as long as penetration take s place. During Expedition 370, we drilled at Site C0023 and occupie d Hole C0023A.  

Cored intervals were calculated based on an initial $1.2–10.0\textrm{m}$ length (i.e., the standard core barrel lengths of the various corin g systems employed during Expedition 370). In addition, we specifie d the collection of different coring intervals in areas of poor recover y or slow rate of penetration. Expansion of cores and gaps related t o unrecovered material resulted in recovery percentages greater o r less than $100\%_{:}$ respectively. Depth intervals were assigned startin g from the depth below seafloor at which coring started (IODP corin g depth scale calculated using Method A [CSF-A]). Short cores (incomplete recovery) were all assumed to start from that initial dept h by convention. Core expansion was corrected during final processing of core measurements by subtracting void spaces, subtractin g exotic material, and accounting for expansion (CSF-B).  

A recovered core is typically divided into $1.4~\mathrm{m}$ long section s that are numbered sequentially from 1 beginning at the top. Material recovered from the core catcher is assigned to a separate section, labeled core catcher (CC), and placed at the bottom of th e lowermost section of the recovered core.  

A full identification number for a sample from a core sectio n consists of the following information: expedition, site, hole, cor e number, core type, section number, and top to bottom interval i n centimeters measured from the top of the section. For example,  a sample identification of “370-C0023A-20R-1, $80{-}85\,\mathrm{cm},^{\prime\prime}$ represent s a sample removed from the interval between 80 and $85~\mathrm{cm}$ belo w the top of Section 1 of the twentieth core taken by rotary core barre l (RCB) from Hole C0023A, during Expedition 370 (Figure F1).  

# Core handling  

The following sections describe the flow of core from the dril l floor through the laboratory. Core handling during Expedition 37 0 followed the general core flow procedure implemented during recent IODP expeditions on the Chikyu but was optimized to proces s and store the samples properly for the scientific objectives of the expedition. The specific core flow for this expedition is illustrated i n Figure F2.

# Core cutting area  

As soon as the core was retrieved on deck, the core catcher wa s delivered to the core cutting area. A small volume $(5{-}10\;\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ sample of material taken from the core catcher was preserved for postcruise micropaleontological analysis, and the rest of the cor e catcher material was packed into a core liner and entered into th e general core flow. The recovered core length and the total length o f void space were then measured and entered into the J-CORES database, along with core identification information, drilling advance, and depth information.  

Upon recovery of gas-rich hydraulic piston coring syste m (HPCS) cores, infrared images were taken in order to identify temperature anomalies indicative for the decomposition of gas hydrates. Samples were taken from gas voids for various gas analyses.  

Prior to cutting the core into sections up to $1.4~\mathrm{m}$ long, a visua l inspection was made to identify structurally important features an d to avoid cutting directly through lithologic contacts or structures. When the core was cut into sequentially numbered sections, drilling fluid left in the core liner was sampled. About $50\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ of sampl e was taken at freshly cut section ends and split into subsamples t o monitor the composition of drilling fluid for contamination contro l in geochemical and microbiological investigations of the core. I n addition, the outer rim of sediment cores that had been in contac t with drilling fluid was sampled for contamination control purposes.  

# Core processing deck  

Each core section was imaged using the X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner. X-ray CT scans were performed on all sections, and data were reviewed by a Co-Chief Scientist and an X-ray C T watchdog for lithostratigraphy and structural geology in order to select the most suitable locations for a complex set of whole-roun d core (WRC) samples for shipboard, shore-based, and postcruise investigations.  

WRC samples were then cut out and stored under appropriat e conditions, used for shipboard analyses of interstitial water (IW), o r transferred by helicopter to KCC for further processing in the super-clean room facility. The cutting was performed with steril e tools, and all end caps of WRCs were cleaned with ethanol, dried i n a clean bench, and radiated with UV light for at least $20\,\mathrm{{min}}$ prior t o use. Samples were packed in gas-tight bags and stored under nitrogen atmosphere.  

The remaining parts of the core sections were examined b y whole-round multisensor core logger (MSCL-W) for gamma ray attenuation (GRA) density, magnetic susceptibility (MS), and natura l gamma radiation (NGR). MSCL-W analysis was conducted at $4\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals for GRA and MS and at $16\;\mathrm{cm}$ intervals for NGR. Subsequently, thermal conductivity was determined if the consolidatio n state of the sediment allowed for the measurement.  

After the MSCL-W scan and thermal conductivity measurement, the core section was split lengthwise along the lines delimiting the archive and working halves. Archive-half sections wer e processed in the following way: digital images were taken with th e photo image logger (MSCL-I) and color spectroscopy logge r (MSCL-C) prior to visual core description by shipboard scientists. Although core description focused primarily on lithology, feature s of possible structural interest were noted so that their complemen t could be identified in the working half for additional description, measurement, and sampling, if warranted. Minuscule samples (approximately the amount that could easily be picked up on the end o f a toothpick) were taken from the archive half in areas of lithologi c interest for smear slide analysis. After the visual core descriptio n was completed, paleomagnetic measurements were conducted using the superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) before the archive halves were prepared for storage.  

For working-half sections of consolidated sediments, therma l conductivity measurement on the split surface of working-half sections started immediately after core splitting. Then, discrete samples were taken from the homogeneous portion, which is free fro m fractures or structures (e.g., faults, foliations, etc.), in the workin g halves for shipboard analysis of physical properties (see Moistur e and density measurements). Subsequently, working halves wer e investigated with respect to structural geology and relevant feature s were described as outlined in Structural description. Finally, th e working halves were sampled for paleomagnetic investigation o f discrete samples (see Discrete samples and sample coordinates )  

and for postcruise research according to the approved sample requests for Expedition 370.  

All half-round core sections were vacuum-sealed in ESCA L bags (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, Japan) following $3\times\,\mathrm{N}_{2}$ flush an d transferred to cold storage. After the expedition, all cores wer e transported under cool temperature $(4^{\circ}C)$ for archiving at KCC i n Kochi, Japan.  

# Transport of samples to shore  

Selected samples were transported to KCC at a frequency of si x flights on average per week for further analysis by the shore-base d team of the science party. Samples were packed with ice packs in a n icebox to maintain either chilled or frozen conditions. Samples fo r cell counts were kept chilled, whereas samples for DNA analysi s were frozen on board the ship. Transport took roughly $3{-}4\,\mathrm{h}$ fro m sample packing in the shipboard laboratory to unpacking at KCC. Preliminary test measurements showed that the temperature wa s below $-50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for mock frozen samples after such a period. Sample s were immediately transferred to appropriate storage space at KC C upon delivery and kept until further processing.  

# Contamination control  

Driven by goals of finding microbial cells and activities down t o the detection limits of existing methods, rigorous QA and qualit y control (QC) was implemented for all core recovery steps, core processing, and in particular microbiological and geochemical analyse s of samples. Procedures were used to identify and account for the introduction of microbial cells, viruses, and chemical species into th e pristine sediment and rock samples from the following potential sources of contamination:  

• Intrusion of seawater and drilling mud during core cutting and recovery, potentially paired with cross contamination resulting from loose borehole fills accumulating on the bottom of the hole;   
• Formation of molecular hydrogen due to corrosion of the drill bit and release of organic compounds due to heating of the core liner at high in situ temperatures;   
• Introduction of microbial cells and chemical compounds from equipment and chemicals used during sample processing; and   
• Contamination of sediment samples during laboratory work from airborne particles.  

In order to minimize the risk of drilling-induced contamination , samples for microbiological and geochemical investigations wer e taken as WRCs from the most undisturbed parts of the recovere d cores, which were identified based on visual inspection and X-ra y CT imaging of the individual core sections. Moreover, concerte d sampling for microbiological and geochemical analyses provides  a means for the confirmation of sample integrity (e.g., elevated sulfat e concentrations in IW samples would be an indicator for the intrusion of seawater during drilling). Furthermore, in general the firs t section was not sampled for microbiological investigations in orde r to avoid cross contamination with borehole fills.  

To sensitively track intrusion of drilling fluid into the sedimen t cores, a perfluorocarbon (PFC) compound was added as a chemical tracer to the drilling fluid, and its presence was monitored in th e exterior, midway, and interior portion of WRCs taken for microbiological investigations. In order to determine the PFC concentratio n of the drilling fluid, we sampled drilling fluid caught inside the cor e liner (hereafter called “core liner fluid”) when cores were cut int o sections in the core cutting area. Moreover, PFC concentration s were determined in bulk samples taken from the top of Section 1 i n order to have a means of comparison between all cores in case n o drilling fluid was caught in the core liner. In addition, referenc e samples were taken from the active mud tanks containing seawate r gel once per day. For details, see QC: assessing potential contamination of sediment samples from drilling fluid during coring.  

In order to monitor the contamination of sediment cores wit h molecular hydrogen and organic compounds, which are potentiall y released from the drill bit and core liner, respectively, samples o f core liner fluid, exposed sediment, and drilling fluid from activ e mud tanks were taken for both inorganic geochemistry (see Dissolved hydrogen and carbon monoxide) and organic geochemistry (see Contamination tests).  

Numerous measures were taken to minimize the introduction o f microbial cells during sample processing (for details, see Qualit y assurance and quality control for sample processing). WRC s were packed with end caps that had been sterilized by ethanol an d UV exposure. Surfaces of workbenches were routinely decontaminated by wiping with RNase AWAY (Molecular Bioproducts Inc., USA) or by exposure to UV light. In addition, the working surfac e was covered with a fresh sheet of aluminum foil each time a ne w WRC was processed. All microbiological samples were collected using sterilized tools, and the nitrogen gas used to flush samples to b e stored under anaerobic conditions was filtered through a $0.22~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ filter to remove potential contamination.  

Contamination of sediment samples with airborne particles i n the laboratory is a major concern. For this reason, shipboard processing of microbiological samples focused on sample storage, an d further sample processing and analyses were conducted at KCC. O n the Chikyu, microbiological sampling was done in clean air environments created by a mobile tabletop air filtration unit that produce s filtered laminar airflow that match International Organization fo r Standardization (ISO) Class 1 clean room standards (KOACH  T 500-F, Koken Ltd., Japan) and an ionizer (Koken Ltd., Japan) that reduces static attraction of potentially contaminating airborne particles. At KCC, further sample processing, including crushing int o powder, cell separation and filtration for counting, and DNA extraction, was conducted in a super-clean room equipped with  a Floor KOACH Ez (KOACH F 1050-F, Koken Ltd., Japan) that produces horizontal ISO Class 1 quality of laminar airflow from the en d wall of the clean space and an ionizer to neutralize static charg e throughout the workspace of the workbench. During both shipboard and shore-based work, airborne particles in the anaerobi c chamber, clean bench, and surrounding laboratory air were periodically monitored by a particle counter throughout the expedition, and the concentration of airborne microbial cells that may potentially contaminate cores during core handling were determined i n representative air samples from various workspaces. For details, se e Quality assurance and quality control for sample processing.  

# Operations  

This chapter describes a newly developed short advance modified HPCS (short HPCS) and the temporary temperature observatory (TTO) that was deployed in Hole C0023A during Expeditio n 370.  

# Short HPCS  

The HPCS is able to obtain high-quality (less disturbed and les s invaded) core samples of soft to semiconsolidated sediment. However, penetration of the core shoe is refused at greater depths onc e the sediment becomes firm and/or lithified. To extend the applicability of the HPCS to deeper and harder sedimentary formations, the conventional HPCS has been modified to a shorter advanc e length of either a 1.5, 3.0, or $4.5\,\mathrm{m}$ core shoe (Figure F3). In addition , the configuration of the piston and the extension rods can be modified for the short advance length (i.e., the shorter advance create s stronger penetration power with the increased shooting speed, an d consequently extends the applicable depth deeper than the standar d $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ HPCS). The diameter of the core sample $\left(61\;\mathrm{mm}\right)$ ) is the sam e as the standard HPCS. The bottom-hole assembly and the applicability of the advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) o n the core shoe are compatible for both the standard HPCS and shor t HPCS.  

# Temperature observatory  

The TTO was installed to monitor the formation temperatur e profile in the cased borehole. The TTO was equipped with 3 9 stand-alone temperature sensor loggers (miniature temperatur e loggers [MTLs]) on a rope and 13 thermistor sensors on 3 flatpac k tubes. The former were designed to be recoverable from the TT O by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), and the latter were designe d for permanent installation in the borehole and equipped with dat a recording units at the CORK head. The ROV operational platfor m and the CORK head were set onto the wellhead of Hole C0023A, allowing future ROV operations to retrieve the rope with the temperature sensor loggers and/or thermistor data.  

Originally, the TTO was designed to cover the full depth to th e hole bottom, but the hole condition below the casing (at 858 mbsf ) did not allow installation of the tubing. Therefore, the design wa s changed on site and the tubing was shortened to $863~\mathrm{m},$ which extends $5\,\mathrm{m}$ below the casing shoe. Table T1 shows the final position s of the sensors.

# Thermistor string  

The thermistor string consists of 13 thermistor sensors $30\;\mathrm{k}\Omega$ at $0^{\circ}C$ ) installed along 3 flatpack strong cables at depths targetin g the décollement zone (Figure F4; Tables T1, T2). The flatpack cabl e is a product of Gulf Coast Downhole Technologies, registered a s Stainless Electric Cable with Safety-Strip. It is $11~\mathrm{mm}$ in diamete r and made of stainless steel pipe $6.35\,\mathrm{mm}$ in diameter) encapsulate d with Santoprene material. Inside the pipe are seven electrical conductors for the thermistor connection. For future pressure monitoring, we deployed one flatpack line with no conductor inside.  

In order to protect the cables and sensors during deployment , cable protectors are attached at every tubing joint and at every sensor module (Figure F5). The thermistor sensor module and conductor connection parts are protected with a stainless steel pipe fille d with epoxy (Figure F6).  

# Miniature temperature loggers  

A total of 39 stand-alone, self-recording loggers were attache d to a $1~\mathrm{{cm}}$ thick Vectran rope (Figures F4, F7; Table T2). They included 6 MTL1854 loggers, 7 MTL1882 loggers, and 27 HOBO U1 2 loggers. The bottom of the rope was connected to a sinker bar t o assist free-fall lowering in the tubing. MTL sensors were deploye d at $50\textrm{m}$ intervals, but depth resolution was increased in interval s with prominent peaks in geochemical profiles (Table T1).  

# MTL1854  

MTL Model 1854 is a product of Antares Datensysteme GmbH . It is a small autonomous system with a very high temperature precision $\langle{\sim}\mathbf{m}\mathbf{K})$ at a water depth of $6000\;\mathrm{m}$ for long-term observation i n the water column or in deep-sea sediments. Temperature data ar e stored in its internal memory and are retrieved through the galvani c coupling (i.e., the data logger is placed in spring-loaded clamps fo r communication and data transfer through a USB or RS-232C interface). The maximum operating temperature is $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

# MTL1882  

MTL Model 1882 is another Antares data logger newly developed for operations up to $120^{\circ}C$ for $1\,\mathrm{y}$ .  

# HOBO U12  

The HOBO U12 deep ocean temperature logger is a singlechannel temperature logger with 12-bit resolution that can recor d up to 43,000 measurements. It is designed to withstand water pressure to $11{,}000\;\mathrm{m}$ and temperatures ranging from $-40^{\circ}$ to $125^{\circ}C$ .  

Temperature data are stored in memory and can be downloade d via USB connection to a PC. The battery will last ${\sim}3\ \mathrm{y}$ for loggin g intervals $>\!1\,\mathrm{\min}$ and with no more than $60\,\mathrm{\min}$ of operation a t $125^{\circ}C$ per day.  

# Calibration and high-temperature test  

All thermistor sensor elements and HOBO U12 loggers wer e calibrated in a water bath for a temperature range between $2^{\circ}$ an d $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and in an autoclave between $60^{\circ}$ and $120^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . All Antare s MTL1882 loggers were tested for $48\,\mathrm{{h}}$ in $60^{\circ}{-}120^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ environments. All HOBO U12 loggers were tested for 6 days in a $120^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ environment. Two of the HOBO U12 sensors were tested for ${\sim}2$ months a t $120^{\circ}C$ .  

Gel mud  

The annulus of the casing and the tubing is filled with a gel mud , which has a shear strength of $2{\sim}3\ \mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ , in order to prevent wate r circulation due to the geothermal gradient in the formation.  

Figure F4. Left: Overall configuration of TTO and CORK system in Hole C0023A. Thermistor string consists of 3 flatpack lines outside a $4\%$ inch tubing designe d to stay permanently in the borehole. Independent sensors are attached to $1\;{\mathsf{c m}}$ Vectran rope designed to hang beneath the MTL hanger.

# Lithostratigraphy  

During Expedition 370, a large fraction of the retrieved core sections was taken as WRCs for crucial geochemical and microbial analyses. Samples were taken immediately after imaging by X-ra y CT. Nevertheless, a detailed lithostratigraphic description was still needed to provide a correlation of Site C0023 to nearby Ocea n Drilling Program (ODP) Sites 1174 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2001b) and 808 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1991) and to provid e standard sample and site descriptions. Lithostratigraphic correlation of Site C0023 with the legacy sites was an important aim o f shipboard work. Lithostratigraphic description of cores during Expedition 370 aimed to provide fundamental geological characterization and was based on  

• Macroscopic observations during visual core description,   
• Petrography targeted to support visual core description and expedition science aims, and   
• X-ray CT image observation.  

# Visual core description  

Split sections were described by shipboard sedimentologists an d structural geologists. Visual core description (VCD) was carried ou t on the archive (lithostratigraphy) and working (structural geology ) halves of each core using traditional ODP and IODP procedure s (e.g., Mazzullo and Graham, 1988). Cores were logged by section, and the information from VCD forms was transferred to the JCORES database before conversion to core-scale plots. When a significant part of a section was missing due to frequent WRC sampling, X-ray CT images and lithologic description of whole-roun d sample residues were used. The legend used for VCDs is shown i n Figure F8. The sedimentological VCD log sheet is presented in Figure F9. Scans of handwritten VCD forms entered into the J-CORE S database are available in VCDDATA in Supplementary material.

# Lithostratigraphic description  

Lithostratigraphic description was performed with formatio n nomenclature used at Sites 808 and 1174 wherever possible fo r lithostratigraphic correlation with these two sites. Previous work a t these sites made use of facies associations and deformation style s distinct within the Nankai Trough subduction zone off Cape Muroto. Previously logged units and their identification criteria ar e summarized here and tabulated in Table T3 with data synthesize d from Shipboard Scientific Party (1991, 2001a). A basaltic pillow lav a forms the upper unit of the basement $\left\langle16\,{\cal M}\mathbf{a}\right\rangle$ , which is overlain b y a basal unit of acidic volcaniclastics $\left\langle15\;\mathrm{Ma}\right\rangle$ ). Overlying these unit s is the lower Shikoku Basin facies (i.e., mid-Miocene to mid-Pliocene), which is distinguished from the unit above by the absence o f volcanic ash layers. The overlying upper Shikoku Basin facies is differentiated from the unit beneath by the presence of abundan t tephra layers (i.e., upper Pliocene to lower Pleistocene). Above thi s is a Quaternary hemipelagic facies comprising mud and turbidite s (i.e., Pleistocene). At ODP Leg 190 Site 1174, this unit was divide d into (1) a transitional facies comprising hemipelagic mud wit h tephra layers and the first occurrences of turbidites, (2) hemipelagi c mud containing silt turbidites, and (3) a unit comprising hemipelagic mud and sand and silt turbidites (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2001a). The topmost unit encountered at Site 1174 was hemipelagi c mud. A comparison between these units and their correlative equivalents at Site C0023 is presented in Lithostratigraphy in the Sit e C0023 chapter (Heuer et al., 2017b).

A lithostratigraphic approach based on sedimentary facies alon e is not sufficient to enable correlation to other sites because of th e presence of laterally traceable structural features. These include  a regionally extensive décollement zone consisting of fault breccia, which was reported to be approximately $_{30\textrm{m}}$ or greater thicknes s at Site 1174 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2001a). Deformation style s above the fault breccia are distinctly different from those beneath; above the décollement zone deformation styles predominantly consist of fracturing, whereas beneath, steepening of bedding is observed. Because core recovery in brecciated horizons can be lo w and because geological brecciation can be hard to distinguish fro m brecciation caused by drilling operations, structural features wer e also logged to help demarcate boundaries and differentiate drillin g and core-handling disturbance from fault brecciation. Further details of structural features are listed in Structural description.  

# Sedimentology and mineralogy  

The main quantitative data gathered to help demarcate formation boundaries were (1) instances of core width to lamina-scal e bedforms such as asymmetrical ripples, cross-lamination, and lowangle planar lamination; (2) the bases of sand and silt beds and san d and silt lamina; (3) the level of bioturbation; (4) the presence of volcaniclastics; and (5) the occurrence of macrofossils and macrophytoclastic wood. These observations were entered into the J-CORE S database.  

# Mineralization  

Mineralization was described according to its habit and majo r observable mineral components. Distinctions were made betwee n stigmatic veins formed in soft sediment, mineralization hosted i n deformation structures, and mineralization associated with or following sedimentary features. The occurrence of early stage diagenetic minerals (e.g., pyrite and calcite) was logged separately and, where appropriate, included within the description of a litholog y (e.g., calcareous mudstones).  

# Volcanic sediments  

To emphasize the differences in composition of sedimentar y horizons containing volcaniclastic sediments, the classificatio n scheme of Fisher and Schmincke (1984) was modified for rapid cor e description. The prefix “volcaniclastic” was reserved for sedimentary rock containing $>\!25\%$ but $-75\%$ volcaniclastics (e.g., a sandstone with $>\!25\%$ volcaniclastics would be termed a “volcaniclasti c sandstone” and a mudstone with $>\!25\%$ volcaniclastics would b e termed a “volcaniclastic mudstone”). Previous work in the regio n has differentiated between reworked volcaniclastics and less altere d pyroclasts (Saito, Underwood, Kubo, and the Expedition 322 Scientists, 2010). Such an approach has many strengths, such as the potential to differentiate between depositional and emplacemen t mechanisms. But in this case, to facilitate rapid core description th e freshness of volcanic clasts was not routinely differentiated. Unit s were logged as tuffs if they comprised $>\!75\%$ volcanic clasts.  

# Bioturbation  

Bioturbation intensity was estimated using a modified version o f the ichnofabric index as described by Droser and Bottjer (1986, 1991). For ease of logging, these values were then recoded for entr y into the J-CORES database as follows:  

Level $1=$ burrows observed.   
Level $2=$ slight bioturbation where burrows cut each other or another sedimentary fabric.   
Level $3=$ burrows and other bioturbation are the main sedimentary fabric at the expense of all other sedimentary structures (e.g., laminae are discontinuous and changes in composition due to depositional processes are obfuscated).  

# Structural description  

Our methods for documenting the structural geology of Expedition 370 cores largely followed those used by Expedition 315 Scientists (2009) and Expedition 316 Scientists (2009), which in turn wer e based on previous ODP procedures developed at the Nankai accretionary margin (i.e., ODP Legs 131 and 190). We documented th e deformation observed in the split cores by classifying structures, determining the depth extent, measuring orientation data, and recording the sense of displacement. The collected data were han d logged onto a printed form at the core table and then typed int o both a spreadsheet and the J-CORES database. Scans of handwritten structural description forms are available in VCDDATA in Supplementary material. The orientation data should be corrected fo r rotations related to drilling on the basis of paleomagnetic declination. However, because of the limitations of time, number of paleomagnetic specialists, and heavy magnetic overprint, we did no t conduct the paleomagnetic restoration during Expedition 370.  

# Structural data acquisition and orientation measurements  

Each structure was recorded manually on a description tabl e sheet (Figure F10). We used a plastic protractor for orientatio n measurements (Figure F11). Use of the working half of the split cor e provided greater flexibility in removing—and cutting, if necessary— pieces of the core for measurements.  

Orientations of planar and linear features in cored material s were determined relative to the core axis, which represents the vertical axis in the core reference frame, and the double line marked o n the working half of the split core liner, which represents $000^{\circ}$ (an d $360^{\circ})$ in the plane perpendicular to the core axis (Figure F12). T o determine the orientation of a planar structural element, two apparent dips of this element were measured in the core reference fram e and converted to a plane represented by dip angle and either a strik e or dip direction (Figure F13). One apparent dip is usually represented by the intersection of the planar feature with the split face o f the core and is quantified by measuring the dip direction and angl e in the core reference frame $\mathsf{\vec{\beta}}_{1}$ in figure). Typical apparent dip measurements have a trend of $090^{\circ}$ or $270^{\circ}$ and range in plunge from $0^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$ $\mathrm{[}\beta_{2}$ in figure). The second apparent dip is usually represente d by the intersection of the planar feature and a cut or fractured surface at a high angle to the split face of the core. In most cases, thi s was a surface either parallel or perpendicular to the core axis. In th e former cases, the apparent dip lineation would trend $000^{\circ}$ or $180^{\circ}$ and plunge from $0^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$ ; in the latter cases, the trend would rang e from $000^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$ and plunge $0^{\circ}$ . Linear features observed in th e cores were always associated with planar structures (e.g., striation s on faults), and their orientations were determined by measuring either the rake (or pitch) on the associated plane or the trend an d plunge in the core reference frame. During Expedition 370, we measured rake for striations on the fault surface (Figure F14), wherea s azimuth and plunge were measured for other lineations (e.g., fol d axes). All data were recorded on the log sheet with appropriat e depths and descriptive information.

# Description and classification of structures  

We constructed a structural geology template for the J-CORE S database that facilitated the description and classification of observed structures. For clarity, we defined the terminology used t o describe fault-related rocks, as well as the basis for differentiatin g natural structures from drilling-induced features.  

Faults were classified into several categories based on the sens e of fault slip and their structural characteristics. The sense of th e fault slip was identified using offsets of markers (e.g., bedding an d older faults) across the fault plane and predominance by slicke n steps. A fault with cohesiveness across the fault zone was describe d as a healed fault. Zones of dense fault distribution and intense deformation were termed “fault zones.” Fault zones are intensively deformed  zones  fragmented  into  centimeter-sized  and  smalle r fragments, containing only a few larger fragments. The size of th e majority of fragments was then logged and the zone recorded as a n intraformational breccia—breccia comprising clasts of overlyin g and underlying lithologies. Clearly, there is the potential for suc h units to be an artifact of the drilling process as well as many geological processes aside from faulting. Where information and geological context supported such an interpretation, these intervals wer e treated as a distinct fault-generated rock type and named accordingly.  

The mineralization style and mineralogy of vein minerals wer e described by the sedimentologists (see above), but the orientation s of veins, foliations, and other structural features were measured b y structural geologists.  

Structural data can sometimes be disturbed by drilling-induce d structures such as flow-in structures in HPCS cores and biscuiting, fracturing, faulting, and rotation of fragments in extended shoe coring system (ESCS) and RCB cores. Where structures have been disturbed by flow-in that occupies ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ of the cross-sectional width o f the core, we excluded measurements of bedding because of the intense disturbance (i.e., bending, rotation, etc.) of these structures.  

# Calculation of plane orientation  

For planar structures (e.g., bedding or faults), two apparent dip s on two different surfaces (e.g., one being the split core surface, which is east–west vertical, and the other being the horizontal o r north–south vertical surface) were measured in the core referenc e frame as azimuths (measured clockwise from north, looking down ) and plunges (Figure F12). A coordinate system was defined in suc h a way that the positive $x_{\mathrm{~}},\,y_{\mathrm{~\rightmoon~}}$ , and $z$ -directions coincide with north, east, and vertical downward, respectively. If the azimuths and plunges of the two apparent dips are given as $(\upalpha_{1},\,\upbeta_{1})$ and $(\upalpha_{2},\,\upbeta_{2})$ , respectively, as in Figure F13, then the unit vectors representing these two lines ( $\nu_{1}$ and $\nu_{2}$ ) are as follows:  

Figure F15. Dip direction $({\mathsf{a}}_{\mathsf{d}}),$ , right-hand rule strike $\left(\mathfrak{a}_{s}\right).$ , and dip (β) of a plane deduced from its normal azimuth $\left(\mathsf{a}_{\mathsf{n}}\right)$ and dip $(\beta_{\mathfrak{n}})$ . $v_{\mathsf{n}}=$ unit vector normal to plane. A. $\upbeta_{\mathfrak{n}}<0^{\circ}.$ . B. $\upbeta_{\mathfrak{n}}\geq0^{\circ}$ .  

$$
\nu_{1}\,=\,{\binom{l_{1}}{m_{1}}}\,=\,{\binom{\cos\alpha_{1}\cos\beta_{1}}{\sin\alpha_{1}\cos\beta_{1}}},\,\mathrm{and}
$$  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\nu_{2}\,=\,\left(\!\!\begin{array}{c}{l_{2}}\\ {m_{2}}\\ {n_{2}}\end{array}\!\!\right)\,=\,\left(\!\!\begin{array}{c}{\cos\upalpha_{2}\cos\upbeta_{2}}\\ {\sin\upalpha_{2}\cos\upbeta_{2}}\\ {\sin\upbeta_{2}}\end{array}\!\!\right)\!,}\end{array}
$$  

where $l,m$ , and $_n$ represent the $x_{\mathrm{~}},y_{\mathrm{~\rightmoon~}}$ , and $z$ -components of the vectors.  

The unit vector normal to the plane $\left(\nu_{\mathrm{n}}\right)$ (Figure F15) is then defined as follows:  

![](images/b5bd98c9410f2a0e6439ef99da55790baeec5a672eb736c881d659fba041c9ab.jpg)  

$$
\boldsymbol{\nu}_{\mathrm{n}}\,=\,\left(\underset{\boldsymbol{n}_{\mathrm{n}}}{m_{\mathrm{n}}}\right)\,=\,\frac{\boldsymbol{\nu}_{\mathrm{1}}\times\boldsymbol{\nu}_{\mathrm{2}}}{\left|\boldsymbol{\nu}_{\mathrm{1}}\times\boldsymbol{\nu}_{\mathrm{2}}\right|},
$$  

where  

where  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\nu_{1}\times\nu_{2}=\left(\begin{array}{l}{\left|\begin{array}{l}{m_{1}\ m_{2}}\\ {n_{1}\ n_{2}}\end{array}\right|}\\ {\left|\begin{array}{l}{n_{1}\ n_{2}}\\ {l_{1}\ l_{2}}\end{array}\right|}\\ {\left|\begin{array}{l}{l_{1}\ l_{2}}\\ {l_{1}\ l_{2}}\end{array}\right|}\\ {\left|\begin{array}{l}{l_{1}\ l_{2}}\\ {m_{1}\ m_{2}}\end{array}\right|}\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{l}{m_{1}n_{2}-m_{2}n_{1}}\\ {n_{1}l_{2}-n_{2}l_{1}}\\ {l_{1}m_{2}-l_{2}m_{1}}\end{array}\right).}\end{array}
$$  

The azimuth $\left(\alpha_{\mathrm{n}}\right)$ and plunge $(\upbeta_{\mathrm{n}})$ of $\nu_{\mathrm{n}}$ are given by the following:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\alpha_{\mathrm{n}}=\tan^{-1}(m_{\mathrm{n}}/l_{\mathrm{n}}),\mathrm{and}}\\ {\beta_{\mathrm{n}}=\sin^{-1}\!n_{\mathrm{n}}.}\end{array}
$$  

The dip direction $(\upalpha_{\mathrm{d}})$ and dip angle (β) of this plane are ${\upalpha}_{\mathrm{n}}$ and $90^{\circ}+\beta_{\mathrm{n}},$ respectively, when $\beta_{\mathrm{n}}<0^{\circ}$ (Figure F15). They are $\alpha_{\mathrm{n}}\pm180^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}-\beta_{\mathrm{n}},$ respectively, when $\beta_{\mathrm{n}}\geq0^{\circ}$ . The right-hand rule strike of this plane $\left(\upalpha_{\mathrm{s}}\right)$ is then given by $\upalpha_{\mathrm{d}}-90^{\circ}$ .  

# Calculation of slickenline rake  

For a fault with striations, the apparent rake angle of the striation $\left(\Phi_{\mathrm{a}}\right)$ was measured on the fault surface from either the $090^{\circ}$ or $270^{\circ}$ direction of the split core surface trace (Figure F14). Fault orientation was measured as described above. Provided that $\nu_{\mathrm{n}}$ and $\nu_{\mathrm{c}}$ are unit vectors normal to the fault and split core surfaces, respectively, the unit vector of the intersection line $(\nu_{\mathrm{i}})$ is perpendicular to both $\nu_{\mathrm{n}}$ and $\nu_{\mathrm{c}}$ (Figure F16) and is therefore defined as follows:  

$$
\boldsymbol{\nu}_{\mathrm{i}}\,=\,\left(\begin{array}{l}{l_{\mathrm{i}}}\\ {m_{\mathrm{i}}}\\ {n_{\mathrm{i}}}\end{array}\right)\,=\,\frac{\nu_{\mathrm{n}}\times\nu_{\mathrm{c}}}{\left|\nu_{\mathrm{n}}\times\nu_{\mathrm{c}}\right|}\,,
$$  

$$
\nu_{\mathrm{c}}\,=\,{\binom{1}{0}}\,,\,{\mathrm{and}}
$$  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\nu_{\mathrm{n}}\times\nu_{\mathrm{c}}\,=\,\left(\begin{array}{l}{\left|m_{\mathrm{n}}\ 0\right|}\\ {n_{\mathrm{n}}\ 0}\\ {\left|n_{\mathrm{n}}\ 0\right|}\\ {\left|l_{\mathrm{n}}\ 1\right|}\\ {\left|l_{\mathrm{n}}\ 1\right|}\\ {m_{\mathrm{n}}\ 0}\end{array}\right)\quad=\,\left(\begin{array}{l}{0}\\ {n_{\mathrm{n}}}\\ {...m_{\mathrm{n}}}\end{array}\right)\!.}\end{array}
$$  

Knowing the right-hand rule strike of the fault plane $(\upalpha_{\mathrm{{s}}})$ , the nit vector $\left(\nu_{\mathrm{s}}\right)$ toward this direction is then  

$$
\nu_{\mathrm{s}}\,=\,\left(\frac{\cos\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}}{\sin\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}}\right)\,.
$$  

The rake angle of the intersection line $(\Phi_{\mathrm{i}})$ measured from the strike direction is given by  

$$
\Phi=\cos^{-1}(\nu_{\mathrm{s}}\times\nu_{\mathrm{i}}),
$$

The rake angle of the striation $(\Phi)$ from the strike direction is $\Phi_{\mathrm{i}}$ $\pm\ \Phi_{\mathrm{a}},$ depending on the direction from which the apparent rake was measured and on the dip direction of the fault. $\Phi_{\mathrm{a}}$ should be subtracted from $\Phi_{\mathrm{i}}$ when the fault plane dips toward the west and $\Phi_{\mathrm{a}}$ was measured from either the top or $090^{\circ}$ direction or when the

# J-CORES structural database  

The J-CORES database is a program used to store a visual (macroscopic and/or microscopic) description of core structures at  a given section index. During Expedition 370, only the locations o f structural features and calculated orientations in the core referenc e frame were input into the J-CORES database, and orientation dat a management and planar fabric analysis were made with a spreadsheet as described above.  

# Petrographic and mineralogical analysis Smear slides  

Smear slides were produced by smearing a small amount $(\mathord{\sim}0.1$ cm) of sample across a glass slide using a toothpick, dispersing th e sample in tap water, and then drying it on a hot plate. Following drying, optical adhesive was added and a cover glass placed on top. Th e adhesive was cured under UV radiation.  

The sample location for each smear slide was entered into the JCORES database with a sample code of SS. Smear slide descriptio n followed the sheet shown in Figure F17; a scheme that matched th e resources of shipboard scientists. Smear slide description primaril y focused on supplying lithology description for the fine-graine d component of mud and mud rocks. Microscopic images of smea r slides are available in SMEARSLD in Supplementary material.  

# Thin sections  

Thin sections were only taken from semiconsolidated or consolidated core. Thin sections were prepared for more intensive analysi s of mineral components not amenable to X-ray diffraction (XRD ) and to observe microstructures and petrographic fabrics, particularly fine-grained igneous rocks. A $30\,\upmu\mathrm{m}\times2\,\mathrm{cm}\times3$ cm section wa s used for each thin section. Thin sections were polished and observed in transmitted light using a Zeiss Axioskop AX10 polarizin g microscope equipped with a Nikon DS-Fi1 digital camera. In a fe w instances, point counting was done to obtain quantitative information on mineral phases and authigenic mineral phases in particular. Microscopic images of thin sections are available in THINSECT i n Supplementary material.  

# X-ray diffraction  

The principal goal of XRD analysis was to estimate the relative weight percentages of total clay minerals, quartz, feldspar, and calcite in specimens of bulk sediment. Material for XRD was obtained from a $10~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ sample that was also used for X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and carbonate analyses. All samples were vacuum-dried, crushed with a ball mill, and mounted as randomly oriented bulk powders. Routine analyses of bulk powders were completed using a newly acquired PANalytical CubiX3 diffractometer. This system has been used on the Chikyu since Expedition 365. Instrument settings were as follows:  

Generator voltage $=45\,\mathrm{kV}$ .   
Tube current $=40\;\mathrm{mA}$ .   
Tube anode $\r=\mathrm{Cu}$ .   
Wavelength $=1.540598\mathring{\mathrm{A}}\left(\mathrm{K}\alpha\right)$ 1) and 1.544426 Å (Kα2).   
Start angle $=2^{\circ}2\theta$ .   
End angle $=60^{\circ}2\theta$ .   
Step spacing $=0.005^{\circ}26\$ .   
Scan step time $=1.27$ s.   
Scan speed $\mathrm{~=~}0.50134^{\circ}26/\mathrm{s}$ .   
Divergent slit $=$ fixed $1/4$ .   
Monochromator used $={\mathrm{yes}}$ .   
Irradiated length $=10\;\mathrm{mm}$ .   
Scanning range $=2^{\circ}{-}60^{\circ}2\theta$ .   
Scan type $=$ continuous.  

To maintain as much consistency as possible with previous results obtained from IODP Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) expeditions, we processed the digital data using  MacDiff  4.2.5  (http://www.ccp14.ac.uk/ccp/web-mirrors/krumm/html/software/macdiff.html).  Functions  included find baseline, smooth counts, and correction of peak position using the quartz peak at $3.343\,\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$ . The upper and lower limits for each diagnostic peak were adjusted manually following the guidelines in Expedition 319 Scientists (2010).  

Calculations of relative mineral abundance utilized regression curves that were generated from analyses of standard mineral mixtures, with all values normalized to $100\%$ . This follows a general procedure first described in Fisher and Underwood (1995). Bulk powder mixtures for the Nankai Trough are the same as those reported by Underwood et al. (2003): quartz (Saint Peter sandstone), feldspar (Ca-rich albite), calcite (Cyprus chalk), smectite (Ca-montmorillonite), illite (Clay Mineral Society IMt-2, 2M1 polytype), and chlorite (Clay Mineral Society CCa-2). The standards were run three times, and the correlations for each mineral are between mean peak area and weight percent. The following polynomial equations provide the statistical fits, where $X=$ peak area and $r=$ correlation coefficient:  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{clay\,minerals}=5.0314+0.0072495(X)-1.919\mathrm{E}{-7}(X^{2}),\quad}\\ {r=0.923;\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad(\mathrm{I}}\end{array}
$$  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{Quartz}=-1.1695+0.00037795(X)-1.2198\mathrm{E}{-}10(X^{2}),}\\ {r=0.991;\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad}\end{array}
$$  

$$
:=0.96439+0.00052385(X)+4.2326\mathrm{E}{-9(X^{2})},
$$  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{:=-1.9208+0.00082643(X)+2.3405\mathrm{E}{-9}(X^{2}),}\\ {r=0.997.\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad}\end{array}
$$  

Average errors (calculated weight percent minus true weight percent) for the standard mineral mixtures are as follows:  

Total clay minerals $=3.3\%$ Quartz $=1.9\%$ .   
Feldspar $=1.1\%$ .   
Calcite $=1.7\%$ .  

Values of relative abundance for natural specimens, however, should be interpreted with some caution. One of the fundamental problems with any bulk powder XRD method is the difference in peak response between poorly crystalline minerals at low diffraction angles (e.g., clay minerals) and highly crystalline minerals at higher diffraction angles (e.g., quartz and plagioclase). Clay mineral content is best characterized by measuring the peak area, whereas peak intensity may be more accurate for quartz, feldspar, and calcite. Analyzing oriented aggregates of clay-size fractions enhances basal reflections of the clay minerals, but that approach is time consuming. For clay mineral assemblages in bulk powders, the two options are to measure one peak for each mineral and add the estimates together (thereby propagating the error) or to measure a single composite peak at $19.4^{\circ}{-}20.4^{\circ}26$ (Table T4). Chlorite does not contribute counts to that composite peak; therefore, natural specimens with high contents of chlorite will yield larger errors. That source of error also applies to the standard mineral mixtures. Other sources of error include contamination of mineral standards by impurities such as quartz and zeolites (e.g., the illite standard contains $\sim\!20\%$ quartz) and differences in crystallinity between standards and natural clay minerals.  

In the final assessment, the calculated mineral abundances reported here should be regarded as relative percentages within a four-component system of clay minerals $^+$ quartz $^+$ feldspar $^+$ calcite. How close those estimates resemble their absolute percentages within the total volume of solids depends on the abundance of amorphous solids (e.g., biogenic opal and volcanic glass) and the total of all other minerals that occur in minor or trace quantities. For most natural samples from Site C0023, the difference between calculated relative abundance and absolute weight percentage is probably between $5\%$ and $10\%$ .  

# X-ray fluorescence  

Core materials were subjected to whole-rock quantitative XRF spectrometry for analysis of major elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Fe, P, K, Ca, Ti, and Mn). XRF analyses were performed on splits of samples used for XRD. All samples were dried and crushed before analysis, together with samples for XRD.  

A glass bead was prepared from approximately $1{\mathrm{~g~}}$ of sample powder before analysis. Analyses were performed using a Supermini XRF spectrometer (Rigaku) with a 200 W Pd anode X-ray tube operated at $50\,\mathrm{kV}$ and $4\,\mathrm{mA}$ . Rock standards from the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology were used for calibration of the XRF spectrometer, using matrix correction s within the operation software. Results were reported as weight percent oxide $\begin{array}{r}{\left(\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O},\right.}\end{array}$ $\mathrm{MgO_{\mathrm{{.}}}}$ , $\mathrm{{Al}}_{2}\mathrm{{O}}_{3}$ , $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ , $\mathrm{P_{2}O_{5}}$ , $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}.$ , CaO, $\mathrm{TiO}_{2},$ , MnO, and $\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3},$ ). XRF results are available in XRF in Supplementary material.

# X-ray computed tomography  

During Expedition 370, the preliminary assessment of cor e quality was performed using X-ray CT images. Scanning for preliminary assessment was done immediately after dividing the core int o sections. WRC sections were screened to avoid destruction of ke y geological features and drilling disturbance (Figure F18).  

X-ray CT images were also used to identify 3-D sedimentar y and structural features, such as bioturbation burrows, beddin g planes, faults, mineral veins, and so on, and also to infer lithology i n intervals where visual core description was not possible becaus e core had been taken as WRC samples for IW analysis or microbiological analyses.  

Our methods followed those in the measurement manual prepared by CDEX (X-ray CT Scanning, Version 3.00; 24 March 2015 ) and used during previous expeditions (e.g., Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 337 and 348). The X-ray CT instrumen t on the Chikyu is a Discovery CT 750HD (GE Medical Systems) capable of generating thirty-two $0.625\,\mathrm{mm}$ thick slice images every 0. 4 s, the time for one revolution of the X-ray source around the sample. Data generated for each core consist of core-axis-normal planes o f X-ray attenuation values with dimensions of $512\times512$ pixels. Dat a were stored on the server as Digital Imaging and Communication i n Medicine (DICOM) formatted files. The DICOM files were restructured to create 3-D images for further investigation.  

The theory behind X-ray CT has been well established throug h medical research and is very briefly outlined here. X-ray intensit y varies as a function of $\mathrm{X}$ -ray path length and the linear attenuatio n coefficient (LAC) of the target material:  

$$
I=I_{0}\times\mathbf{e}^{-\upmu L},
$$  

where  

$I=$ transmitted X-ray intensity, $I_{0}={}$ initial X-ray intensity, $\upmu=\mathrm{LAC}$ of the target material, and $L=X$ -ray path length through the material.  

LAC is a physical index about the X-ray beam reduction durin g translation of target materials. LAC is led from the relationship between physical properties of target materials (i.e., chemical composition, density, and state). The basic measure of attenuation, o r radiodensity, is the CT number given in Hounsfield units (HU):  

$$
\mathrm{CT\number}=\mathrm{[(\upmu_{\mathrm{t}}-\upmu_{\mathrm{w}})/\upmu_{\mathrm{w}}]\times1000},
$$  

where  

# $\mu_{\mathrm{t}}=\mathrm{LAC}$ for the target material, and $\upmu_{\mathrm{w}}=\mathrm{LAC}$ for water.  

The distribution of attenuation values mapped to an individua l slice comprises the raw data that are used for subsequent image processing. Successive 2-D slices yield a representation of attenuatio n values in 3-D pixels referred to as voxels. Analytical standards use d during Expedition 370 were air (CT number $=-1000)$ , water (C T number $\mathbf{\theta}=\mathbf{\alpha}0$ ), and aluminum $2477\,<\,\mathrm{CT}$ number $<\,2487$ ) in a n

acrylic core mock-up. All three standards were run once daily afte r air calibration. For each standard analysis, the CT number was determined for a $24.85~\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ area at fixed coordinates near the cente r of the cylinder.  

# Core quality factor using the CT number  

The core quality factor (CQF) is a measure of the quality of recovered core that is calculated using data acquired during X-ray C T scanning. It was measured on each section using X-ray CT scanne d DICOM files of $0.625\ \mathrm{mm}$ thick slice images. The process for CQ F measurement in this report is as follows. First, we selected a circula r region of interest $30{-}50\;\mathrm{mm}$ in diameter at the slice center, depending on the diameter of the core. A histogram of the number of pixel s with a given CT number was examined to identify the representative material within the section; the CT number of the representative material creates a peak in the histogram, and $70\%$ of th e representative CT number at the peak was used as the threshold t o differentiate pristine, high-quality areas from damaged areas. Whe n the ratio of high-quality area to total area was higher than 0.99, th e slice was regarded as a “high-quality slice.” This was repeated fo r each slice of the section. Finally, the percentage of high-qualit y slices to the number of all slices of the section was measured as th e CQF score. These calculations were conducted using ImageJ software (Schneider et al., 2012).  

# Average CT number  

To characterize the major constituting materials of core samples, the average CT number of each slice was measured using a 1 0 mm diameter $\times\ 0.625\ \mathrm{mm}$ thick slice taken at the slice center. DICOM files of the slices were processed using ImageJ.  

# High CT number area  

A profile of areas with distinctly high CT numbers was made t o show the distribution of higher density minerals such as pyrite, rhodochrosite, and barite. Within each $0.625\;\mathrm{mm}$ thick slice image, w e selected a circular area of $30{-}50\ \mathrm{mm}$ diameter at the center of  a slice, depending on the diameter of the core. Within the selecte d area, the fractional area that has CT numbers of ${>}3000$ was calculated using ImageJ. The calculation was conducted for each slice image and then presented as a depth profile.  

# Scanning electron microscopy  

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersiv e spectrometry (EDS) using a JEOL electron microscope on th e Chikyu was used for detailed observation and detection of mineral s for a few selected samples. Observations were qualitative in natur e and limited primarily to crystal and grain morphology with limite d data on relative elemental abundance obtained. Data from SEMEDS are available in SEM in Supplementary material.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic investigations during Expedition 370 were primarily designed to determine the characteristic remanence directions for establishing magnetostratigraphy and to reorient cores fo r structural analysis. To accomplish these goals, paleomagnetic measurements were performed on archive halves and discrete cub e samples. It is essential to know the primary magnetization components to estimate magnetostratigraphy. To obtain these data, secondary  magnetization  components  first  needed  to  b e demagnetized. Archive halves were demagnetized with a 2G60 0 sample degaussing system coupled to a SRM. For discrete samples, alternating field (AF) demagnetization was used. After demagnetization, SRM measurements were conducted on archive halves, an d spinner magnetometer measurements were conducted on discret e samples. Paleomagnetic direction (declination, inclination, an d magnetic intensity) was generated using these measurements. Detailed procedures and sample coordinates are described below.  

# Laboratory instruments  

Magnetic shielding is particularly important to protect core s from magnetic noise during measurement. The paleomagnetis m laboratory on the Chikyu is a magnetically shielded room $7.3\;\mathrm{m}\times$ $2.8\mathrm{~m}\times1.9\mathrm{~m}]$ ), in which the internal total magnetic field is ${\sim}1\%$ o f Earth’s magnetic field. The room is oriented with its long axis transverse to the long axis of the ship and houses an SRM and other magnetically sensitive instruments. The room is large enough t o comfortably handle a standard IODP core section $^{\leftmoon}_{\rightmoon}{}150\ \mathrm{~cm}$ i n length).  

# Superconducting rock magnetometer  

The long-core SRM system (2G Enterprises, model 760) is $\sim\!6\,\mathrm{m}$ long with an $8.1~\mathrm{{cm}}$ diameter access bore that allows the measurement of a $1.5~\mathrm{m}$ long split core. The SRM has three sets of superconducting pickup coils, two for transverse moment measuremen t $x-$ and $y$ -axes) and one for axial moment measurement ( $\overrightharpoon{z}$ -axis ) (Figure F19). The noise level of the magnetometer is ${<}10^{-7}\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ fo r a $10\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ volume rock. A 2G600 sample degaussing system is coupled to the SRM to allow automatic AF demagnetization of sample s up to $100\;\mathrm{mT}$ . The system is controlled by an external computer an d enables programming of a complete sequence of measurements an d degauss cycles without removing the long core from the holder. During Expedition 370, the measurement interval was $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ . Archive halves were demagnetized at 10 and $20~\mathrm{mT}$ to allow furthe r demagnetization during postcruise analysis. Because of time constraints, core catcher samples and core sections ${<}10\ \mathrm{cm}$ long wer e not measured. Archive halves deeper than Core 370-C0023A-84 R were only demagnetized at $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ and were measured by laborator y technicians.  

# Spinner magnetometer  

A spinner magnetometer, model SMD-88 (Natsuhara Gike n Co., Ltd.), is available on the Chikyu for remanent magnetizatio n measurement of discrete samples. The noise level is $\sim\!5~\times~10^{-7}$ $\mathrm{mAm^{2}}$ , and the measurable range is from $5\times10^{-6}$ to $3\times10^{-1}\,\mathrm{mAm}^{2}$ .  

![](images/be1890a11f2888d010485534d1b02420723502d87919e60f304896960636c2ff.jpg)  
Figure F19. Orientation system of cores, discrete samples, and SRM used during Expedition 370. SQUID $=$ superconducting quantum interference device.  

During Expedition 370, two different sizes of sample holders wer e used for measuring weak $(1\times10^{-5}\sim1\times10^{-2}\,\mathrm{mAm^{2}})$ and strong ( $\mathrm{~\textit~{~1~}~}\times$ $10^{-4}\sim1.0\;\mathrm{mAm^{2}})$ samples, respectively. Five standard samples wit h different intensities were prepared to calibrate the magnetometer. Samples in standard $7\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ Natsuhara cubes were measured in thre e or six positions with a typical stacking of 64–256 spins.  

# Alternating field demagnetizer  

The DEM-95 AF demagnetizer (Natsuhara Giken Co., Ltd. ) equipped with a sample tumbling system was set for AF demagnetization of standard discrete samples (maximum $\mathrm{AF}=180~\mathrm{mT}$ ). Afte r measuring natural remanent magnetization (NRM), samples wer e stepwise demagnetized at 10 and $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ to decipher paleomagneti c data. Some samples near structural features were demagnetized using up to $80\;\mathrm{mT}$ .  

# Discrete samples and sample coordinates  

Discrete cubic samples $({\sim}7~\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ were taken, one per section, from the working halves in order to determine paleomagnetic direction for magnetostratigraphy and reorientation of cores. The actua l spacing depended on the properties and conditions of the core material (e.g., avoiding flow-in, coring disturbances, etc.). Paleomagnetic sampling mostly concentrated on hemipelagic mud (o r mudstone) as the dominant lithology. In some cases, samples wer e taken near structural features to assist reorientation of the features. Samples from the dominant lithology were demagnetized up to 2 0 mT, and samples near structural features were demagnetized up t o $80\;\mathrm{mT}$ . The orientation of discrete samples is shown in Figure F19.  

# Magnetostratigraphy  

Magnetic polarity was determined based on the inclination sig n of the discrete samples after AF demagnetization at $20~\mathrm{mT}$ . Fo r some discrete samples, further steps of AF demagnetization $(0,\,10,$ 20, 30, 40, 60, or $80~\mathrm{mT}$ ) were conducted. Zijderveld plots (Zijderveld, 1967) were inspected visually for behavior of remanen t magnetization after demagnetization. Stable (primary) remanen t magnetization directions of discrete samples were fit using principal component analysis (PCA) (Kirschvink, 1980), and the obtaine d inclination was used for the determination of paleomagnetic fiel d polarity. The ages of the polarity intervals used during Expeditio n 370 were from the geomagnetic polarity timescale 2012 (Gradstei n et al., 2012) (Table T5).  

# Data processing  

Data from archive halves and discrete samples were saved i n DAT and TXT file formats and uploaded to the J-CORES databas e by shipboard laboratory technicians. Data reduction (Zijderveld demagnetization plots and equal-area projections) was conducted using the visualization software Progress, programmed by H. Shibuy a (Kumamoto University, Japan). This software also allows PC A (Kirschvink, 1980).

# Physical properties  

Continuous physical properties measurements provide crucia l parameters required to identify lithostratigraphic units, to correlat e seismic reflection data with discrete core measurements and descriptions, and to characterize the habitat of subseafloor microbia l communities. A variety of techniques and methods were used o n Expedition 370 core samples. Prior to sampling and interpretation, X-ray CT images were captured for all cores. After the X-ray C T scans were completed, GRA density, MS, and NGR were measure d using the MSCL-W (Geotek, Ltd., London, United Kingdom) fo r whole-round analysis. After MSCL-W measurements and cor e splitting, digital photo image scanning using the MSCL-I and colo r spectrophotometry scanning using the MSCL-C were carried ou t on the split surfaces of archive halves. Thermal conductivity wa s measured mostly on working halves and partially on WRCs. $P.$ -wav e velocity and electrical resistivity measurements were taken on discrete cube samples in the $x_{\mathrm{~\,~}},y_{\mathrm{~\,~}}$ , and $z$ -directions to evaluate anisotropy of velocity and resistivity. Moisture and density (MAD) wer e measured on discrete samples collected from WRCs for shipboar d gas analysis (community gas [COMGAS] samples) and from working halves. MAD analyses provide information on water content, bulk density, porosity, void ratio, and grain density. Anelastic strai n recovery (ASR) measurements were conducted on 15 WRCs t o evaluate both orientation and magnitude of 3-D present-day principal stress. In addition to physical properties measurements on cor e samples, in situ temperature measurements were carried out usin g the APCT-3. Details and procedures for each measurement are described below.  

MSCL-W  

# Gamma ray attenuation density  

Bulk density is used to evaluate pore volume in sediment, whic h provides information on the consolidation state. GRA is based o n the detection of a gamma ray beam during its passage through th e sediment. The beam, produced by a $370~\mathrm{MBq}~^{137}\mathrm{Cs}$ gamma ra y source within a lead shield with a $5~\mathrm{mm}$ collimator, was directe d through WRCs. The gamma ray detector includes a scintillator an d an integral photomultiplier tube to record the gamma rays that pas s through the WRC. GRA bulk density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{b}}\right)$ was calculated as  

$$
\mathsf{\rho_{b}}=\ln(I_{0}/I)/\upmu d,
$$  

where  

$I_{0}={}$ gamma ray source intensity,   
$I=$ measured intensity of gamma rays passing through the sample,   
$\upmu=$ Compton attenuation coefficient, and   
$d=$ sample diameter.  

The Compton attenuation coefficient $(\upmu)$ and source intensit y $\left(I_{0}\right)$ were treated as constants, so $\rho_{\mathrm{b}}$ can be calculated from I. Th e gamma ray detector was calibrated with a sealed calibration core ( a standard core liner filled with distilled water and aluminum cylinders of various diameters). To establish the calibration curves, gamma ray counts were measured through a $7~\mathrm{cm}$ diameter standard cylinder composed of aluminum with six different diameter s $(1{-}6~\mathrm{cm})$ (density $=2.7~\mathrm{g/cm}^{3}$ ) filled with surrounding water. Th e relationship between $I$ and $\upmu d$ is  

$$
\mathrm{ln}(I)=A(\upmu d)+B,
$$  

where $A$ and $B$ are coefficients determined from the calibration experiment. GRA density measurements on core samples were conducted every $4\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ for $4\,{\mathsf s}$ . The spatial resolution is $5\;\mathrm{mm}$ .  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

MS is the degree to which a material can be magnetized by a n external magnetic field. Therefore, MS reflects the composition o f sediment. An $^{8}\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ diameter Bartington loop sensor was used t o measure MS. An oscillator circuit in the sensor produces a low-intensity $\left({\sim}80\ \mathrm{\A/m}\right)$ root-mean-square) nonsaturating alternatin g magnetic field $(0.565\,\mathrm{kHz})$ . This pulse frequency was converted int o MS. The spatial resolution of the loop sensor is $23{-}27\;\mathrm{mm}$ . MS dat a were collected every $4\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ along the core.  

# Natural gamma radiation  

NGR measurements provide insights into sediment composition and thus can be used to identify lithology. WRCs are monitore d for NGR emissions to obtain spatial variability in radioactivity. NG R measurement employs lead-shielded counters optically coupled to  a photomultiplier tube and connected to a bias base that supplie s high-voltage power and a signal preamplifier. Two horizontal an d two vertical sensors are mounted in a lead cube-shaped housing. The NGR system records radioactive decay of $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th},$ and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ and has a resolution of $120{-}170\ \mathrm{mm}$ in terms of core length. Measurements were conducted every $16~\mathrm{cm}$ with a count time of $30~\mathrm{s}$ . Background radiation noise was determined by taking measurements on a water-filled calibration core. Two radioactive isotop e standards $^{133}\mathrm{Ba}$ and $^{60}\mathrm{Co}$ ) were used for energy calibration and adjustment of the spectral detection windows.  

# Thermal conductivity  

The rate at which heat flows through a material depends o n thermal conductivity and is dependent on mineral and fluid compositions, porosity, and structure. Thermal conductivity was measured on sediment and rock samples using either the full-spac e needle probe (Von Herzen and Maxwell, 1959) or the half-space lin e source (Vacquier, 1985), which approximates an infinite line source. In unconsolidated sediment where a probe could be inserted int o the core without fracturing the sediment, the full-space needl e probe was inserted into WRCs through a hole drilled in the cor e liner. When sediment strength precluded use of the full-spac e probe, the half-space probe was used on the split working half. Fo r consolidated sediment, the half-space probe was placed directly o n the split surface with seawater used to provide good contact. Bot h full- and half-space measurements produce a scalar thermal conductivity value in the plane perpendicular to the orientation of th e probe.  

All measurements were made after the cores had equilibrated t o room temperature (i.e., ${\sim}24^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . At the beginning of each measurement, temperature in the core was monitored to ensure that thermal drift was ${<}0.4\mathrm{\m^{\circ}C/m i n}$ (typically within $1\mathrm{-}2\;\mathrm{min}$ ). After it wa s established that the temperature was near equilibrium, a calibrate d heat source was applied and the rise in temperature was recorde d for ${\sim}80\mathrm{~s~}$ . Values of thermal conductivity were based on the observed rise in temperature for a given quantity of heat. The fullspace needle and the half-space line probes were calibrated at leas t once every $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ . The calibration was performed on Macor sample s of known thermal conductivity ( $1.611\,\pm\,2\%$ W/[m·K] and $1.652\pm$ $2\%\,\mathrm{W/[m{\cdotK}]}$ for the full- and half-space probes, respectively).  

# $P$ -wave velocity  

Discrete $P$ -wave velocity was measured with the $P.$ -wave logge r (Geotek, Ltd., London, United Kingdom) on cubic samples $\cdot^{2}\,\mathrm{cm}$ $\times\;2\;\mathrm{cm}\times2\;\mathrm{cm}$ ) cut from working halves. The oriented cubic samples were soaked in $35\%_{0}$ NaCl solution and rotated manually t o measure $x_{\mathrm{-}},y_{\mathrm{-}}$ , and $z$ -axis velocities (Figure F20). The $P_{-}$ -wave logge r is equipped with two $230\;\mathrm{kHz}$ transducers, one used as a transmitter and one as a receiver. Sample length $(L)$ was measured with  a laser distance sensor. During measurement, the sample was place d between the transducers and held in place with a constant force. The transmitter was connected to a pulse generator, and the receiver was connected to an oscilloscope synchronized with th e pulse generator. $P$ -wave total traveltime $\r(t)$ for the first arrival wa s picked and logged from the digitally displayed oscilloscope signal. The velocity in any direction (e.g., $V_{\mathrm{p_{x}}}$ ) was calculated from the sample length (e.g., $L_{\mathrm{x}})$ , total traveltime $(t_{\mathrm{x}})$ , and system-calibrated dela y time $(t_{\mathrm{delay}})$ :  

$$
V_{\mathrm{px}}=L_{\mathrm{x}}/(t_{\mathrm{x}}-t_{\mathrm{delay}}).
$$  

Horizontal anisotropy of velocity $(A_{\mathrm{vh}})$ and vertical anisotropy o f velocity $(A_{\mathrm{vv}})$ were calculated using the following equations:  

$$
A_{\mathrm{vh}}=200[(V_{\mathrm{px}}-V_{\mathrm{py}})/(V_{\mathrm{px}}+V_{\mathrm{Py}})],\mathrm{and}
$$  

$$
A_{\mathrm{vv}}=200[(V_{\mathrm{px}}+V_{\mathrm{Py}})/2-V_{\mathrm{Pz}}]/[(V_{\mathrm{Px}}+V_{\mathrm{Py}})/2+V_{\mathrm{Pz}}],
$$  

where $V_{\mathrm{p_{x}}},\,V_{\mathrm{p_{y}}},$ and $V_{\mathrm{p_{z}}}$ are the velocity in each axial direction.  

Routine QC measurements were performed every $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ by measuring velocity on glass and acrylic standards with known length s and velocities.  

# Electrical impedance  

Electrical impedance was measured with an Agilent 4294A precision impedance analyzer using the bridge method with either tw o electrodes for cubic samples or a four-pin electrode for unconsolidated sediment.  

For consolidated sediment from which a cubic sample could b e made, the oriented cube was placed between two stainless steel electrodes covered with seawater-saturated filter paper. The magnitude $(|Z|)$ and phase (θ) of the complex impedance were measure d  

Figure F20. Core reference frame used in physical properties sampling, Expedition 370.  

![](images/d44010056f21e855cd6f622551de469b5089e8f167787f5aded8eee5a089e522.jpg)  

at $25~\mathrm{kHz}$ between opposite cube faces. The cube was rotated t o measure impedance in the $x_{\mathrm{~}},\,\mathrm{y}_{\mathrm{~}}$ , and $\mathbf{Z}$ -directions (Figure F20). Th e electrical resistivity for each direction (e.g., $R_{\mathrm{x}})$ was computed fro m the complex impedance measured along each direction (e.g., $x)$ an d sample dimensions defined by face length $(L)$ :  

$$
R_{\mathrm{x}}=(|Z_{\mathrm{x}}|\mathrm{cos}\Theta-|Z_{\mathrm{f}}|\mathrm{cos}\Theta_{\mathrm{f}})\times(L_{\mathrm{y}}\times L_{\mathrm{z}}/L_{\mathrm{x}})/100,
$$  

where $|Z_{\mathrm{f}}|\mathsf{c o s}\Theta_{\mathrm{f}}$ is the resistance of the paper filters and $L_{\mathrm{x}},L_{\mathrm{y}},$ and $L_{\mathrm{z}}$ are the lengths of the triaxial directions. Other resistivity values o n the $y_{\mathrm{~\,~}}$ - and $z$ -directions ( $\boldsymbol{R_{\mathrm{y}}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{z}}$ ) are described by the same equation.  

Horizontal anisotropy of electrical resistivity $\left({A_{\mathrm{rh}}}\right)$ and vertica l anisotropy of electrical resistivity $(A_{\mathrm{rv}})$ were calculated using the following equations:  

$$
A_{\mathrm{rh}}=200(R_{\mathrm{x}}-R_{\mathrm{y}})/(R_{\mathrm{x}}+R_{\mathrm{y}}),\,\mathrm{and}
$$  

$$
A_{\mathrm{rv}}=200[(R_{x}+R_{\mathrm{y}})/2-R_{\mathrm{z}}]/[(R_{x}+R_{\mathrm{y}})/2+R_{\mathrm{z}}],
$$  

where $R_{\mathrm{x}},R_{\mathrm{y}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{z}}$ are electrical resistivity in each axial direction.  

In order to account for temperature variations, between $23.5^{\circ}$ and $24.4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in the laboratory, resistivity data are represented as apparent formation factor, which is the ratio of sediment resistivit y and seawater resistivity at the same temperature:  

$$
F_{\mathrm{x}}=R_{\mathrm{x}}/R_{\mathrm{f}}
$$  

where $F_{\mathrm{x}}$ is the apparent formation factor on the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -direction and $R_{\mathrm{f}}$ is the resistivity of standard seawater at room temperature as mentioned below. The relationship between $R_{\mathrm{f}}$ and temperature $(T)$ i s given by (Shipley, Ogawa, Blum, et al., 1995):  

$$
R_{\mathrm{f}}=1/(2.8+0.1T).
$$  

Apparent formation factors for the $y.$ - and $z$ -directions $[F_{\mathrm{y}}$ an d $F_{\mathrm{z}}$ were derived by the same relation.  

Formation factor of bulk rock $(F_{\mathrm{bulk}})$ is defined as  

$$
F_{\mathrm{bulk}}=R_{\mathrm{bulk}}/R_{\mathrm{fluid}},
$$  

where $R_{\mathrm{bulk}}$ is the mean value of triaxial resistivity described as  

$$
R_{\mathrm{bulk}}=(R_{\mathrm{x}}^{~2}+R_{\mathrm{y}}^{~2}+R_{\mathrm{z}}^{~2})^{1/2}
$$  

and $R_{\mathrm{fluid}}$ is the resistivity of standard seawater (Shipley, Ogawa, Blum, et al., 1995).  

Calibration was required prior to measurement and every $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ when using the instrument continuously. For calibration, the twoelectrode bridge was brought into both open and short states.  A standard disk attachment was applied to the calibration with th e nonconductive cap on at an open state and also without the cap at  a short state.  

For unconsolidated sediments, the complex impedance wa s measured using the impedance analyzer with a four-pin array consisting of four electrodes spaced $7.5~\mathrm{mm}$ apart. The array was inserted directly into the $y_{\mathrm{~\,~}}$ -direction of the working half (Figure F20 ) and measured the complex impedance (magnitude $[|Z|]$ and phas e [θ]) at $25\,\mathrm{kHz}$ , from which the electrical resistivity is calculated:  

$$
R_{\mathrm{y}}=|Z_{\mathrm{y}}|\mathrm{cos}\Theta_{\mathrm{y}}/d_{\mathrm{r}},
$$  

where $d_{\mathrm{r}}$ is dependent on the geometry of the electrode array an d was determined every $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ by comparing the measured impedanc e with an International Association for the Physical Sciences of th e Oceans (IAPSO) standard seawater solution $(35\,\mathrm{\g/L\NaCl})$ of  a known electrical impedance. Formation factor on the $y_{\mathrm{~\,~}}$ -axis $(F_{\mathrm{y}})$ wa s calculated from Equations E27 and E28.  

# Moisture and density measurements  

Discrete samples from working-half cores and from WRCs collected for shipboard gas analysis were used for determination of index properties (bulk density, grain density, dry density, wate r content, porosity, and void ratio). Index properties were determine d from phase relations, mass measurements on wet and dry specimens, volume measurements on dry specimens, and corrections fo r salinity. In general, one discrete sample $({\sim}8~\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ adjacent to cub e samples for $P$ -wave and electrical impedance measurements wa s collected from each core section for determination of index properties. Sample intervals were adjusted to obtain minimally disturbe d homogeneous samples.  

Wet and dry masses were measured using a paired electroni c balance system, which is designed to compensate for ship heave.  A standard mass of similar value to the sample was placed on the reference balance to increase accuracy. The sample mass was determined to a precision of $\pm0.005\,\mathrm{g}$ . The balance system was calibrate d at least once per $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ .  

To minimize desiccation, MAD sample collection was immediately followed by measurement of wet sediment mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ . Afte r $M_{\mathrm{wet}}$ measurements, samples were dried in a convection oven a t $105^{\circ}\pm\,5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ . Dry samples were placed in a desiccator for a t least $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ to equilibrate to room temperature $({\sim}24^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ , and then dr y sediment mass $(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ and dry sediment volume $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ were measured. A five-chamber Quantachrome pentapycnometer was use d to measure $V_{\mathrm{dry}}$ with a helium-displacement technique providin g precision of $\pm0.04~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The five-chamber system allowed the measurement of four sample volumes and one calibration sphere. Eac h measured volume is the average of five volume measurements. Th e calibration sphere was rotated between all measurement chamber s to monitor for errors in each chamber. The pycnometer was calibrated at least once per $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ .  

Standard ODP/IODP practices were used to determine pore water mass and volume, salt mass and volume, and solid grain mas s and volume (Blum, 1997). From these data, bulk density, dry density, grain density, porosity, and void ratio were calculated (Blum, 1997) as described below. Standard seawater density $(1.024\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , salinity (35 parts per thousand [ppt]), and a constant salt densit y $(2.22\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ were assumed for all calculations.  

# Water content  

Water content $(W_{\mathrm{c}})$ was determined following the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard D2216 (ASTM International,  1990).  Corrections  are  required  for  salt  whe n measuring the water content of marine samples. In addition to th e water content calculation in ASTM D2216 (i.e., the ratio of por e fluid mass to dry sediment mass; $W_{\mathrm{c}}[\mathrm{dry}])$ ), we also calculated th e ratio of pore fluid mass to total sample mass $\big(\mathrm{{W_{c}[w e t]}}\big)$ . The equations for water content are  

$$
W_{\mathrm{c}}(\mathrm{dry})=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{d}})/(M_{\mathrm{d}}-\mathrm{s}M_{\mathrm{wet}}),\mathrm{and}
$$  

$$
W_{\mathrm{c}}(\mathrm{wet})=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{d}})/M_{\mathrm{wet}}(1-\mathrm{s}),
$$  

where  

$\boldsymbol{M}_{\mathrm{wet}}=$ total mass of the discrete sample, $M_{\mathrm{d}}=\mathrm{mass}$ of the dry sample, and $\scriptstyle\mathbf{s}\;=$ salinity (assumed dimensionless constant at 0.035).  

# Bulk density  

Bulk density is the density of a discrete core sample $\left(\rho_{\mathsf{b}}\ =\right.$ ${M_{\mathrm{wet}}}/{V_{\mathrm{t}}})$ . Total wet sample mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ was measured immediatel y after collecting each discrete sample using the dual-balance system. Total sample volume assuming $100\%$ saturation $\,V_{\mathrm{t}}=V_{\mathrm{g}}+V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ wa s determined from the pycnometer measurement of grain volum e $(V_{\mathrm{g}})$ and the calculated volume of pore water $(V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ . Solid grain an d pore water volume were determined as  

$$
V_{\mathrm{g}}=V_{\mathrm{d}}-(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{d}})\mathrm{s}/\rho_{\mathrm{salt}}(1-\mathrm{s}),\,\mathrm{and}
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{pw}}=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{d}})/\uprho_{\mathrm{sw}}(1-\mathrm{s}),
$$  

where  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{V_{\mathrm{d}}=\mathrm{dry}\,\mathrm{volume},}\\ &{\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}}=\mathrm{salt}\,\mathrm{density},\,\mathrm{and}}\\ &{\uprho_{\mathrm{sw}}=\mathrm{standard}\,\mathrm{seawater}\,\mathrm{density}.}\end{array}
$$  

# Porosity and void ratio  

Porosity $(\Phi)$ relates the volume of the pores to total sample volume; void ratio $(e)$ relates the pore volume to solid grain volume. They are calculated as  

$$
\Phi=\rho_{\mathrm{b}}V_{\mathrm{pw}}/M_{\mathrm{wet}},\mathrm{and}
$$  

$$
e=V_{\mathrm{pw}}/V_{\mathrm{g}}.
$$  

# Grain density  

Grain density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{g}})$ was determined from measurements of dr y mass and dry volume made with the balance and the pycnometer, respectively. Mass and volume were corrected for salt, yielding  

$$
\rho_{\mathrm{g}}=(M_{\mathrm{d}}-M_{\mathrm{salt}})/\{V_{\mathrm{d}}-(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{d}}){\sf s}/[\rho_{\mathrm{salt}}(1-\mathrm{s})]\},
$$  

where the density of salt $\left(\boldsymbol{\rho}_{\mathrm{salt}}\right)$ is assumed to be constant at 2.2 2 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ .  

# MSCL-I: photo image logger for archive halves  

Digital images of archive-half cores were acquired by a line-sca n camera equipped with three charge-coupled devices. Each chargecoupled device has 2048 arrays. The reflected light from the cor e surface is split into three channels (red, green, and blue [RGB]) by  a beam splitter inside the line-scan camera and detected by the corresponding charge-coupled device. The signals are combined, and th e digital image is reconstructed. A correction is made for any mino r mechanical  differences  among  the  charge-coupled  device  responses. A calibration is conducted before scanning each core t o compensate for pixel-to-pixel response variation, uneven lighting, and lens effects. After colors of black $\mathrm{RGB}=0]$ ) and white $\mathrm{\Delta[RGB=}$ 255) are calibrated with an f-stop of $\mathrm{f}/16,$ , the light is adjusted t o have an adequate grayscale of $\mathrm{RGB}=137$ at an f-stop of $f/11$ . Optical distortion was avoided by precise movement of the camera. Spatial resolution is 100 pixels/cm. A white chart and grayscale car d were scanned as QC measurements while scanning each section.  

Approximately every $20\ \mathrm{cm}$ interval of a section was scanned t o produce several image files from this instrument, and then all relevant images were merged to produce a whole section image. Resolution of the images obtained on the Chikyu is 300 dpi. Merge d images were processed by gamma correction at the value of 1.4 using a batch file to change the brightness. The images were processe d by Adobe Photoshop to adjust RGB values of the grayscale t o around 100, 100, and 100, respectively.  

# MSCL-C: color spectroscopy for archive halves  

The MSCL-C system equipped with a color spectrophotomete r (Konica-Minolta, CM-2600d) was used to measure color reflectance of split core sections. The spectrophotometer moves ove r each section and moves down to contact the split archive core surface at every $4\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ interval to collect color data. The reflected light i s collected in the color spectrophotometer’s integration sphere an d divided into wavelengths at $10~\mathrm{nm}$ pitch $\mathrm{^{400-700}\ n m)}$ ). The colo r spectrum is then normalized by the source light of the reflectanc e and calibrated with the measurement of a pure white standard. Th e measured color spectrum is normally converted to lightness $\left(\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\right)$ and chromaticity variables $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ (for details, see Blum, 1997). The $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ value represents lightness, from black $\left(\mathrm{L}^{*}=0\right)$ ) to white $\mathrm{L}^{*}=$ 100). The $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ value represents color changing from pure green $\left(\mathbf{a}^{*}\!=$ −127) to pure red $\left(\mathbf{a}^{*}\ =\ 127\right)$ ), and the $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ value represents colo r changing from pure yellow $(\mathsf{b}^{*}\;=\;-127)$ to pure blue $\left(\mathsf{b}^{*}\,=\,127\right)$ ). These parameters can provide information on relative changes i n bulk material composition that are useful to analyze stratigraphi c correlation and lithologic characteristics and cyclicity.  

# In situ temperature measurements  

Direct measurements of in situ temperature are critical t o defining transport, diagenesis, and microbial activity in marin e sediments.  During  Expedition  370,  in  situ  temperatur e measurement was carried out using the APCT-3 (Heesemann et al., 2006), which was equipped with the HPCS core shoe to measur e downhole in situ temperatures. The APCT-3 consists of three components: electronics, coring hardware, and computer softwar e (http://iodp.tamu.edu/tools/pdf/apct3.pdf). In situ temperatur e measurements were conducted during short HPCS coring betwee n 189.3 and 407.6 mbsf. The sensor was calibrated for a working rang e of $-5^{\circ}{-}50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

The electronics fit into a special cutting shoe, which was lowered to the seafloor and shot into the formation. To equilibrate wit h seafloor temperature, the cutting shoe was held at the mudline fo r ${\sim}10$ min before shooting. After shooting, it takes ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{min}$ for th e sensor to equilibrate to the in situ temperature of the formation. Mud pumps needed to be off during temperature equilibration. Shooting the barrel into the formation normally causes a rapid increase in temperature due to frictional heating. After that, temperature  changes  with  time  to  equilibrate  toward  the  formatio n temperature. Temperature was measured as a time series with  a sampling rate of $_{\mathrm{~1~s~}}$ . Temperature data were logged onto a microprocessor within the downhole tool; when the tool was retrieved, data were downloaded into a computer.  

In situ temperatures are extrapolated from the APCT-3 measurements for approximately $10\;\mathrm{min}$ , using the program TP-Fit developed by Heesemann et al. (2006), which includes the 3- D geometry effect and the dependence of the thermal diffusion process on thermal properties (e.g., thermal conductivity). Heeseman n et al. (2006) reported that the exact tool penetration time is virtuall y impossible to predict a priori. This is because actual penetratio n (and thus frictional heating) occurs in a complicated way, wherea s the model assumes instantaneous frictional heating. Practically, th e time shift relative to the penetration is statistically determined t o minimize the misfit between measurements and the model. Th e overall uncertainties in equilibrium temperatures are estimated t o be $0.1^{\circ}{\sim}0.2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (e.g., Kinoshita et al., 2015).  

If heat transfer is by conduction and heat flow is constant, th e thermal gradient will be inversely proportional to thermal conductivity, according to Fourier’s law. This relationship can be linearize d by plotting temperature as a function of cumulative thermal resistance (Bullard, 1939):  

$$
{\cal T}(z)={\cal T}_{0}+q{\sum}_{i}^{N}{}_{=\,0}\,\biggl(\frac{\Delta z_{\mathrm{i}}}{k(z)_{\mathrm{i}}}\biggr),
$$  

where  

$T\!=$ temperature,   
$z=$ depth,   
$T_{0}=$ temperature at the seafloor,   
$q=$ heat flow,  

$$
\sum_{i}^{N}=0\;\binom{\Delta z_{\mathrm{i}}}{k(z)_{\mathrm{i}}}=\mathrm{thermal~resistance},
$$  

$k=$ thermal conductivity, and $N\!=$ number of thermal conductivity measurements.  

In practice, $q$ and $T_{0}$ are estimated by plotting $T(z)$ against cumulative thermal resistance. By using the plot of temperature versu s cumulative thermal resistance, we can make an assessment of th e consistency of heat flow with depth. Assuming heat flow is constan t with depth, formation temperature is estimated by the product o f heat flow and thermal resistance to the depth of interest.  

# Anelastic strain recovery analysis  

The ASR technique is a core-based stress measurement that ca n evaluate both orientation and magnitude of 3-D present-day principal stress on rock. The ASR approach is to measure the anelasti c strain change by releasing the stress soon after core recovery. Th e methodology used for ASR measurement during Expedition 370 i s based on Matsuki (1991), following the guideline described in Lin e t al. (2007). An ${\sim}15~\mathrm{cm}$ long undisturbed WRC section was selecte d for ASR measurement by checking the X-ray CT image. MSCL- W measurements were not performed on the ASR samples because th e measurement is time sensitive and requires instrumentation a s soon as core is retrieved from the subsurface to capture early strai n recovery. The WRC samples for ASR measurement were pushe d out of their core liners, and the outer surface was immediatel y sanded with 120 mesh sandpaper wet with seawater to remove drilling mud and make a flat surface prior to analysis.  

The anelastic strains shown by elliptical shape of the specimen s in nine directions, including six independent directions, were measured using 18-wire strain gauges (6 cross and 6 single gauges). I n cases where a few fractures had developed in the specimen, the fractures were glued to prevent the sample from splitting into pieces. I t took $1\mathrm{-}2\,\mathrm{h}$ to mount 18 strain gauges, and the total elapsed time jus t after core on deck was $2{-}4\,\mathrm{h}$ before starting to record the strain recovery. The core samples were double-bagged (with plastic and aluminum) and submerged in a thermostatic water bath wher e temperature changes were kept controlled at $22^{\circ}\pm0.1^{\circ}C$ for the duration of the measurement. Strain values were collected every 1 0 min for at least 5 days.  

# Inorganic geochemistry  

Inorganic geochemical data, in particular sedimentary IW profiles, provide essential information about the availability of metabolic reactants and the abundance of metabolic products. Thes e data are used to identify and quantify the rates of biogeochemical reactions. In addition, abiotic reactions, mineral alteration (e.g., smectite-to-illite transformation or precipitation of authigenic carbonates), and advective fluid flow can be identified using profiles o f dissolved species.  

During Expedition 370, we sampled IW for a wide range of shipboard and shore-based chemical and isotopic analyses. We also collected  squeeze  cakes  (residue  of  sediment  after  pore  wate r extraction) and other solid-phase samples from working halves fo r analyses of organic and inorganic chemical species.  

# Interstitial water collection  

We collected IW samples by squeezing WRC samples in titanium squeezers $87\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter) modified after the stainless steel squeezer of Manheim and Sayles (1974). WRCs were selected base d on X-ray CT image analysis to largely avoid horizons with fracture s and disturbances and varied in length from 10 to $80\;\mathrm{cm}$ , dependin g on core recovery, lithology, and desired IW volume. Sample spatial frequency typically varied between 1 and 2 per $10\;\mathrm{m}$ . After cutting, WRCs were placed into a nitrogen-flooded glove bag where the y were cleaned from drilling fluid, and squeezers were filled with sediment, flushed with nitrogen, and closed. We carried out this procedure in a glove bag in order to minimize the oxidation of oxygensensitive species such as $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{S}/\mathrm{H}\mathrm{S}^{-}$ .  

We carefully removed the outer layer of sediment with a cerami c knife to minimize contamination of the IW sample by seawater an d drilling fluid. Initially, we removed ${\sim}3~\mathrm{mm}$ from the outside of th e core and then increased this to $5~\mathrm{mm}$ after Core 370-C0023A-54 R (715 mbsf) because we discovered a variance in dissolved sulfat e that, based on a diffusion model, could be explained by diffusion o f liner fluid sulfate into the core. After Core 83R, we further increased this removal of outer layer to $7~\mathrm{mm}$ . The thickness of th e material removed from the WRC was measured with a caliper. Fo r WRCs with interior fractures, all fracture surfaces were cleaned t o the target scraping depth.  

We applied up to 30,000 lb force to the squeezers using a Carve r laboratory hydraulic press. This maximum force was chosen t o avoid clay mineral dehydration. A select subset of low volume– yielding WRCs were first squeezed at 30,000 lb and then squeezed at 60,000 lb to increase the total IW volume yield. Chlorinity titrations were performed on water extracted at both forces, in cas e higher pressures caused sample freshening.  

Squeezers were rinsed with $18\,\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water and thoroughly drie d with compressed air before each use. IW was passed through a prewashed (with $18\;\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water) Advantec $13\;100\%$ alpha cotton cellulose $3~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ filter fitted above a titanium screen within the squeeze r and collected in a $24\,\mathrm{mL}$ acid-washed plastic syringe. Expressed I W was then extruded through a Millipore Millex-LH hydrophilic 0.4 5 $\upmu\mathrm{m}$ polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) disposable filter fitted to the syringe tip into an acid-washed high-density polyethylene (HDPE ) vial. We recovered between 0.5 and $33\;\mathrm{mL}$ of water.  

We determined aliquot volumes for the various analyses base d on yield. Aliquots for sulfide and iron analyses were taken first in  a nitrogen-flushed box to minimize oxidation of these analytes. Se e Table T6 for a list of aliquots collected for shore-based analyses.

# Interstitial water analysis  

# Salinity  

We used an Atago RX-5000i refractometer to determine salinity. IAPSO standard seawater and $18\;\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water was used for calibration. The standard deviation of the daily measurement of IAPS O standard seawater is equivalent to $0.4~\mathrm{mg/kg}$ salinity.  

# Alkalinity  

We measured alkalinity immediately following extraction excep t for Samples 370-C0023A-27R-1, $40.0{-}65.0\,\mathrm{cm},$ , through 54R-1, $6.0-$ $36.0\ \mathrm{cm}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , which were analyzed within 7 days of collection durin g which time we conducted method modifications. Furthermore, Samples 21R-2, $10.0–32.0\ \mathrm{cm}$ , 22R-8, 122.0–147.0 cm, 25R-6, $_{0.0-}$ $31.0\,\mathsf{c m}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , and 26R-1, $65.0{-}97.0\,\mathrm{cm}_{:}$ , were remeasured using the modified method 15–16 days after sample collection. Alkalinity was determined by Gran titration with a Metrohm 794 basic Titrin o autotitrator and a glass $\mathsf{p H}$ electrode. IW volumes between 0.3 an d $3.0~\mathrm{mL}$ were titrated with nominal 0.1 or 0.01 M HCl at $25\mathrm{{^\circC}}$ . Tota l volumes titrated were made to $3.0~\mathrm{mL}$ with a $0.7\mathrm{~M~}$ KCl solution.  A $100\ \mathrm{mM}$ $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ solution was used for weekly calibration of th e acid. Quality checks were conducted twice per day using either a 5 0 $\mathrm{mM}$ solution of $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ for the $0.1\ M\ H C1$ or 1:3 diluted IAPS O standard for the 0.01 M HCl. The standard deviations were $0.5\;\mathrm{mM}$ $\left(N=15\right)$ ) and $0.09\,\mathrm{mM}$ $\left(N=33\right)$ ), respectively. Acid dosing during th e linear part of the Gran titration was either 8 or 12 steps. For al l aforementioned samples that were run with the modified alkalinit y method with $0.01\mathrm{~M~HCl},$ , the number of steps was 12, which increased precision and more effectively covered the voltage range o f $220{-}240\ \mathrm{mV}.$  

# Dissolved inorganic carbon  

We determined dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentratio n with a Marianda automated infrared inorganic carbon analyze r (AIRICA) system, a third-party tool provided by the Geobiolog y Laboratory, University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography (USA). The AIRICA system consists of a syringe module,  a sample-stripping manifold, and a LI-COR LI-7000 $\mathrm{CO_{2}/H_{2}O}$ analyzer. An IW sample or standard was acidified in the stripper wit h three $50~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ strokes of $10\%$ phosphoric acid. The $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ was strippe d from the sample with $\Nu_{2}$ and dried using a series of two Perma Pur e Nafion tubes and a cooling chamber before measurement of infrared absorption due to $C O_{2}$ . The absorption was integrated and th e total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ of a sample was calculated based on comparison to th e standard using the Beer-Lambert law. A single determination consisted of three separate $1\;\mathrm{mL}$ injections of sample or standard; eac h injection was preceded by two $1.1\;\mathrm{mL}$ rinses of the stripper. The integrated absorption of the first injection was discarded to avoid carryover, and the remaining two were averaged to calculate DI C concentration. IW samples were variably diluted with aerated 1 8 MΩ water.  

The laboratory standard for DIC was certified reference material (CRM) Batch 156 seawater prepared at the Marine Physical Laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography (USA). Total DI C in the standard is assayed by batch. Batch 156 has a DIC concentration of $2.099\;\mathrm{mM}$ . The standard was analyzed at the start of an analytical run and was subsequently analyzed following every fiv e samples to constrain instrument drift. All standards and sample s were run in duplicate. The detrended average of CRM Batch 15 6 seawater from each daily analytical run was used for determinin g concentration.  

DIC concentration was calculated using the following equation:  

$$
\mathrm{DIC}=(A_{\mathrm{sample}}/A_{\mathrm{standard}})\times2.099\,\mathrm{mM},
$$  

where $A_{\mathrm{sample}}$ and $A_{\mathrm{standard}}$ are the average integrated Beer-Lamber t $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ absorptions of the sample and standard, respectively. Uncertainty is given as the standard error of the mean based on the poole d standard deviation $(0.052\;\mathrm{mM})$ of duplicates.  

# Chloride  

Chloride concentration was determined by $\mathrm{AgNO_{3}}$ titration o f $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of IW. All samples were analyzed in duplicate. We used  a Metrohm 794 basic Titrino autotitrator and a Metrohm $\mathrm{Ag}$ electrode. The $\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ titrant was nominally 0.01 M. Our ion chromatography results demonstrate that bromide concentrations do no t vary enough to affect the calculated chloride concentrations. Standardization was based on replicate analyses of IAPSO Batch P15 7 (salinity $=34.994\$ ; chloride $=559.2\;\mathrm{M}$ at the typical measured laboratory temperature $[21.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}]]$ ). We report the standard error of th e mean as $0.052\;\mathrm{mM}$ based on the pooled standard deviations of duplicate analyses.  

# Sulfate and bromide  

We determined sulfate and bromide with a Dionex ICS-2100 io n chromatograph. The column oven was set at $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The eluent solution was $40\;\mathrm{mM}$ potassium hydroxide. A 1:200 dilution of IW wit h $18.2\ M\Omega$ deionized water was analyzed. Aliquots of a standar d (IAPSO Batch 157, salinity $=\ 34.994\}$ were used in all analytical batches. In each batch, every diluted sample was analyzed twice. A n IAPSO standard was analyzed after every fifth analysis.  

Reported concentrations are based on the measured ratios t o chloride $\mathrm{(SO_{4})^{2-}/C l}$ or $\mathrm{{Br/Cl}}$ ) and titration chloride, as this metho d removes variations caused by temperature-dependent changes i n the injected volume and sample dilution. Measured area ratios o f the standard vary slightly with time during an analytical run (drift ) and with the peak area of chloride. Drift was corrected for by detrending the measured IAPSO standard that was analyzed after every fifth analysis, and sensitivity to chloride was accounted for usin g IAPSO standard diluted to various extents.  

The values are reported as both percent anomalies in ratios t o $C1^{-}$ normalized to the measured IAPSO standard ratios and as concentrations as described previously (Expedition 329 Scientists, 2011). Sulfate and bromide anomalies, symbolized by $\Sigma{\cal S}{\cal O}_{4}$ an d ΣBr, are the percent difference in the $X/{\sf C l}^{-}$ ratio (where $X=\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ − or $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ ) of the sample relative to the ratio of the IAPSO standard:  

$$
\Sigma X=[(R_{\mathrm{sample}}/\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{IAPSO}})-1]\times100,
$$  

where  

$$
R_{\mathrm{sample}}/\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{IAPSO}}=(X/\mathrm{Cl}^{-})_{\mathrm{sample}}/(X/\mathrm{Cl}^{-})_{\mathrm{IAPSO}}.
$$  

We present the anomalies as they are measured with very hig h precision and are independent of dilution in the laboratory and i n situ. For example, dehydration reactions can lead to a sulfate gradient but do not affect the anomaly.  

The standard deviations of the detrended drift standards wer e $0.03\mathrm{~mM}$ for $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ and $0.003\mathrm{~mM}$ for Br. This was similar to th e pooled standard deviations of the sample duplicates. Based on this, we report uncertainty as the error of the mean for the average o f duplicate analyses, $0.02\;\mathrm{mM}$ for $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ and $0.002\,\mathrm{mM}$ for $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ .  

Sulfate and bromide concentrations $(\mathrm{mM})$ were calculated fro m ratios to $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ and titration chloride $(\mathrm{mM})$ with the following formulas:  

$$
X=(R_{\mathrm{sample}}/\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{IAPSO}})\times(\mathrm{Cl^{-}})_{\mathrm{titration}}\times(X/\mathrm{Cl^{-}})_{\mathrm{sw}},
$$  

where $\mathrm{(SO_{4}^{\mathrm{~2-}}/C l^{-})_{s w}=5.173\times10^{-2}}$ and $\left(\mathrm{Br^{-}/C l^{-}}\right)_{\mathrm{sw}}=1.543\times10^{-3}$ .  

# Ammonium  

Dissolved ammonium was determined colorimetrically utilizin g an automated spectrophotometer (SEAL Analytical AQ2 discret e analyzer). The AQ2 has a sampling probe with a stepper motor– driven syringe, a quartz-halogen lamp, a flow-through cuvette (5 0 $\upmu\mathrm{L})$ , and a photodiode. The analytical procedure is based on absorption spectroscopy of indophenol blue. Indophenol blue is formed b y reaction of ammonium with the diazotization of phenol and subsequent oxidation of the diazo compound by sodium hypochlorite. Samples and reagents are taken into reaction segments with th e sampling probe and warmed to $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $8\,\mathrm{{min}}$ to enhance color development. Then the colored solution is transferred to the cuvett e and its absorbance is read at $620\;\mathrm{nm}$ . All operations, including sample dilution, color development, measurement, and calculation, ar e automated and controlled by operation software. Concentration s were calculated based on a standard curve determined before eac h analytical run. A drift standard was run after every five samples. The standard deviation of replicate analyses of the $0.071~\mathrm{mM}$ Q C standard was $0.001\;\mathrm{mM}$ .  

# Nitrate  

Dissolved nitrate was determined colorimetrically utilizing a n AQ2 discrete analyzer. Nitrate is reacted with vanadium(III) chloride, HCl, and a color reagent (sulfanilamide and N-1-naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride), and absorbance is measured with  a photodiode. A calibration curve was measured at the start of eac h batch. For the shallow samples, the concentration limit of the calibration curve was $71.25~\,\upmu\mathrm{M},$ whereas this was adjusted for th e deeper samples to a lower concentration range ${<}17.81~\upmu\mathrm{M}.$ . A blan k test was performed after the first batch of samples, consisting of fiv e different blanks (Table T7). Results indicate that careful sample collection and storage in non-nitric acid–cleaned vials will set the detection limit of the nitrate analysis at a conservative value of $10\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ .  

# Sulfide  

Hydrogen sulfide $\mathrm{(H_{2}S,\ H S^{-})}$ concentrations were determine d using the methylene blue method based on Fischer (1883) afte r Cline (1969). As hydrogen sulfide is volatile and oxidizes rapidly t o sulfate, we used IW samples derived from WRCs that were prepared for squeezing in a $\Nu_{2}$ -filled glove bag. After squeezing, $_{0.5-}$ $1.0~\mathrm{mL}$ of IW was transferred into 0.4 or $0.6~\mathrm{mL}$ of a $0.05~\mathrm{M}$ zin c acetate (ZnAc) solution (dilution factor $=1.4\AA$ ) to precipitate sulfid e as $Z\mathsf{n S}$ . Samples were stored at $4^{\circ}C$ until measurement in batches ( a maximum of 2 weeks after sampling) using a Hach DR 280 0 spectrophotometer. Calibrations were performed for concentrations up to $1.5\:\mathrm{mg/L}$ of sulfide using a solution of $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{S}\cdot9\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}.$ Befor e analysis, samples were shaken thoroughly and pipetted into half-micro cuvettes. Small volume samples were diluted 1:2 with $\Nu_{2}$ -bubbled ZnAc solution. Then $15~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of color reagent $\left(0.4\,\textrm{g}\,\mathrm{N},\mathrm{N}-\right.$ dimethyl-1.4.phenylendiammonium-dihydrochloride  in $100~\mathrm{~mL~}$ $30\%\,\mathrm{v/v\,HCl})$ and $30\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of catalyst $\mathrm{(1.6\,g\,FeCl_{3}{\cdot}6H_{2}O}$ in $100\,\mathrm{mL}\,30\%$ $\mathrm{v/v\HCl})$ ) were added and mixed with the IW/ZnAc solution. Samples were measured after $10{-}15\ \mathrm{min}$ at $670\;\mathrm{nm}$ wavelength. Detection and quantification limits of the method were 0.2 and $0.4~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ respectively.

Blank types include squeezer blank s (with and without filter), syringe blanks (cleaned with and without $\mathsf{H N O}_{3})$ , an d vial blanks (sample collection vial filled with Milli-Q water). Three replicates o f each blank were collected (A, B, and C), and those with enough volume collected were run in duplicate (1 or 2). Download table in CSV format.

# Ferrous iron  

The determination of $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ was based on Stookey (1970) and performed with a Hach DR 2800 spectrophotometer. As $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ oxidize s quickly, samples were taken from WRCs that were prepared fo r squeezing in a $\Nu_{2}$ -filled glove bag. To avoid exposure to ambient air, the syringes in which the IW was collected were also placed into  a $\Nu_{2}$ -flooded workstation for anaerobic sample transfer into cuvettes.  

All of the flasks used for reagent and standard preparations wer e rinsed with 1:20 diluted HCl and $18~\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water before use and al l solutions were prepared with $\Nu_{2}$ -bubbled $18\,\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water. For calibration up to $1~\mathrm{mg/L}$ $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ , a standard solution of $\mathrm{FeSO_{4}{\cdot}7H_{2}O}$ an d ascorbic acid $\left(C_{6}\mathrm{H}_{8}\mathrm{O}_{6}\right)$ in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ -free $18\;\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water was prepared. Th e color reagent was prepared from $0.25~\mathrm{g}$ of ferrozine in $5~\mathrm{mL}$ of 1 8 MΩ water. Aliquots of $100{-}1000~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of IW were pipetted into cuvettes prefilled with $50~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of the ferrozine solution. Deeper tha n $540\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ samples were generally diluted 1:10 with $\ensuremath{\mathrm{N}}_{2}$ -bubbled artificial seawater, as sample volume was limited. After $5{-}10\;\mathrm{min}$ , samples were measured at $565\ \mathrm{nm}$ (photometer zeroed with $18~\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water). Detection and quantification limit were 0.3 and $0.8\,\upmu\mathrm{M}\,\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ , respectively, for diluted samples.  

# Major cations  

We determined major cations $(\mathbf{Na}^{+},\mathbf{K}^{+},\mathbf{Mg}^{+2},$ and $C\mathbf{a}^{+2}$ ) using  a Thermo Scientific Dionex ICS-2100 ion chromatograph equippe d with an IonPac CS12 analytical column $\mathrm{{^4\mm\times\,250\mm}};$ ; par t number 46073) with methanesulfonic acid eluent. Concentration s were determined based on a standard curve made from variably diluted IAPSO standard. Samples were either diluted 1:200 or 1:40 0 with $18\,\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water. A large volume of 1:200 diluted IAPSO standar d was prepared as drift standard and measured after every five analyses to enable drift correction. The relationship between peak are a and $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ concentration of the standard was linear within measurement precision; however, $\mathrm{K^{+}}$ , ${{\mathrm{M}}{{\bf g}}^{+2}}$ , and $C\mathbf{a}^{+2}$ peak area sensitivit y depended on the peak area of $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ , presumably due to the pea k spreading associated with higher $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ concentrations. We correcte d for this effect by creating a standard working curve for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ , ${{\mathrm{M}}{{\bf g}}^{+2}}$ , and $C\mathbf{a}^{+2}$ peak areas as a function of the $\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}$ peak area.  

Precision based on the standard deviations of the detrende d drift standard were 0.4, 0.03, 0.2, and $0.03\mathrm{~mM}$ for Na, K, Mg, an d Ca, respectively.  

# Minor elements  

Minor elements (B, Ba, Fe, Mn, Sr, Li, Si, and Al) were analyze d using inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometr y (ICP-AES) (Horiba Jobin Yvon ULTIMA 2). IW samples were acidified with 6 M HCl and stored at $4^{\circ}C$ until measurement in a total o f 5 batches, whereby sample distribution into the different sequence s was random. An aliquot of the acidified sample was diluted 1:2 0 with $0.15\mathrm{~M~HNO}_{3}$ containing $10\,\mathrm{ppm}$ yttrium (Y) as internal standard water. A multielement stock solution was prepared from ultrapure primary standards (SPC Science PlasmaCAL) and diluted wit h dilution factors of 100, 20, 10, 4, 2, and 1 with $0.15\mathrm{~M~HNO}_{3}$ . Th e resulting solutions were further diluted 1:8 with sulfate-free artificial seawater to match the sample matrix. Finally, these workin g standards were diluted 1:20 before each sequence using the same Ycontaining $0.15\mathrm{~M~HNO}_{3}$ solution as for the actual samples. A second multielement solution prepared separately from the calibratio n stock solution was used as a QC. Furthermore, the third calibratio n standard was run as an additional “drift check” sample. QC, drif t check, and a blank were measured after each group of five IW samples. We subtracted the averaged blank intensities from net intensities of all calibration standards, samples, QCs, and drift checks an d divided the ratio of the blank-corrected intensity of each catio n $(\mathrm{Int_{x}})$ over the respective Y intensity $(\mathrm{Int_{Y}})$ by slope m of the calibration regression line:  

$$
X=(\mathrm{Int_{x}/I n t_{Y}})/m,
$$  

where  

$$
m=(\mathrm{Int_{x-CAL}/I n t_{y-C A L}})/X.
$$  

In this way, we corrected for drift within an analytical sequence . However, calculated cation concentrations still showed small offset s between batches. Therefore, we used the drift check samples for  a second correction of the data, where we multiplied all element concentrations derived from one run with the respective ratio of th e target drift check concentration over the average drift check concentration for the specific sequence. The resulting detection an d quantification limits and the precision for each cation are given i n Table T8. Boron concentrations of the quality check derived fro m one sequence were consistently $15\%$ too high. Respective information is given as a remark for all affected samples in the data summary sheet.

# Headspace gas analysis  

# Dissolved hydrogen and carbon monoxide  

We quantified dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO concentrations using a Pea k Performer 1 (PP1) gas chromatograph (GC), a third-party tool provided by the Geobiology Laboratory, University of Rhode Islan d Graduate School of Oceanography (USA). Immediately followin g X-ray CT scan of the recovered core, a minimally disturbed 5–1 0 cm core interval adjacent to the IW-dedicated WRC sample wa s identified for COMGAS sampling. The COMGAS WRC was sampled using a plastic cut-off syringe or ceramic knife, depending o n the hardness of the sediment. Two types of samples were collecte d for $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO concentration measurements: (1) duplicate $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ samples were taken from the interior part of the core and (2) on e additional sample was taken from the outer edge of the whole roun d to assess potential liner fluid contamination of the WRC sample. Two additional samples were taken in the core cutting area immediately after core recovery to complement the assessment of liner flui d contamination: (1) about $5~\mathrm{mL}$ core liner fluid samples were collected at the top, middle, and bottom of the core, depending on th e availability of liner fluid, and (2) $1{-}5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment was scrape d off the edge of the core with a ceramic knife on two opportunit y cuts (i.e., core section cuts).  

Samples were extruded into $20~\mathrm{mL}$ borosilicate glass headspac e vials with septum screw caps and completely filled with $18\,\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water. Care was taken to overfill the vials with the $18\,\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water befor e closing to avoid any air contamination. The $18\;\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water used fo r this analysis was prepared in a single batch and analyzed periodically to assess the blank.  

The method relies on the nearly complete extraction of dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO into a defined $\mathrm{H}_{2}/\mathrm{CO}$ -free gas volume. Using  a gas-tight syringe, $1\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of nitrogen $\left(\mathrm{N}_{2}\right)$ gas headspace was inserte d into the vial through a needle. The $\Nu_{2}$ gas used for the headspac e injection was taken from the bypass-out outlet from the PP1, thu s ensuring low $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO content, as this gas has gone through a catalytic converter that oxidizes $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO. To avoid overpressurization of the sample vial during the headspace injection, an equivalen t amount of water was allowed to escape from the vial through a separate needle. Next, the samples were stored upside down for up t o $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ to allow $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO to diffuse out of the IW and equilibrat e with the headspace. Prior to measurement, the vials were vorte x mixed for $_{30\,\mathsf{s}}$ to ensure that the dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO were concentrated in the headspace. Similar approaches for $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ analysis hav e successfully been applied during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 322, 329, and 337 (Expedition 322 Scientists, 2010; Expedition 329 Scientists, 2011; Expedition 337 Scientists, 2013), and more detailed information on this method can be foun d in Lin et al. (2012).  

The PP1 was fitted with a $25\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ sample loop and calibrated on  a daily basis using a 14.3 parts per million by volume (ppmv) $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ ga s standard and a 14.2 ppmv CO gas standard. A four-point calibratio n curve was obtained by measuring the standards using different siz e sample loops (10, 25, 50, and $100~\upmu\mathrm{L},$ ). To perform a measurement, $500\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of headspace gas was extracted using a gas-tight syringe wit h a needle and injected into the PP1. The measured $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO concentrations of the headspace were then converted to molar IW $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO concentrations using the following equations:  

$$
n_{\mathrm{H2}}=X_{\mathrm{H2}}(V_{\mathrm{headspace}}/V_{\mathrm{molar}}),\,\mathrm{and}
$$  

$$
n_{\mathrm{CO}}=X_{\mathrm{CO}}(V_{\mathrm{headspace}}/V_{\mathrm{molar}}),
$$  

# where  

$n=$ total number of moles $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ or CO) in the sample (mol),   
$X=$ molar fraction of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ (or CO) in the headspace gas (ppm, obtained from GC analysis),   
$V_{\mathrm{molar}}=$ molar volume of headspace gas at laboratory temperature $\left(\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{mol}\right)$ , and   
$V_{\mathrm{headspace}}=$ volume of the headspace (L).  

Also,  

$$
\mathrm{[H_{2}]_{I W}}=n_{\mathrm{H2}}(V_{\mathrm{sed}}/\Phi)\,\mathrm{and}
$$  

$$
[\mathrm{CO}]_{\mathrm{IW}}=n_{\mathrm{CO}}(V_{\mathrm{sed}}/\Phi),
$$  

where  

$\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{IW}}=$ concentration of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ dissolved in the IW (M), $[\mathbf{CO}]_{\mathrm{Iw}}=$ concentration of CO dissolved in the IW (M), $V_{\mathrm{{sed}}}=$ sediment sample volume (L), and $\boldsymbol\Phi=$ sediment porosity.  

Each sample was analyzed in duplicate. The pooled relativ e standard deviation of these duplicates was 65 and $26\;\mathrm{nM}$ for $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ an d CO, respectively. Based on this, we report the standard error of th e mean as 46 and $19\ \mathrm{nM}$ for the average of each duplicate pair.  A headspace extraction efficiency experiment was performed in duplicate prior to the measuring campaign and demonstrated that o n average $87\%$ of the total $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ within each sample was captured int o the headspace. We correct for this incomplete recovery of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ an d CO in the headspace by multiplying measured concentrations by  a factor of 1.15.  

Procedural blank samples, headspace vials solely filled with 1 8 MΩ water, were prepared for each WRC sampled for gas analysis. The procedural blank associated with this method averaged $3.4~\pm$ $0.6\;\mathrm{nM}$ for $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $4.0\pm0.2\,\mathrm{nM}$ for CO. The PP1 $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO blankcorrected concentration detection limit (based on three times th e standard deviation of the blank) obtained using this protocol wa s $0.6~\mathrm{nM}$ $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $0.2~\mathrm{nM}$ CO. Laboratory air $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO concentrations were monitored regularly throughout the span of the measuring campaign.  

In parallel to the extraction method for determination of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentrations, we also performed incubation experiments wher e the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentrations were monitored as a time series, similar t o the experiments conducted by Hoehler et al. (1998). Approximatel y $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ long WRC samples taken every $100\;\mathrm{m}$ of core were dedicate d to incubation experiments. Given the determined core flow in th e laboratory, WRC samples couldn’t be processed right away an d were therefore stored in $\Nu_{2}$ -flushed bags at $4^{\circ}C$ for a few hours prio r to sampling. Using a ceramic knife, a $5\;\mathrm{mm}$ layer around the edge s of the WRC was carefully scraped off. Following scraping, about 6 0 $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment was collected and subsequently dispersed into si x $20\;\mathrm{mL}$ head space vials (i.e., $10\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ per vial), closed with thick butyl rubber stoppers, and crimp capped. Headspace vials were thoroughly flushed with ultrapure and $0.22~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ filtered $\Nu_{2}$ gas in orde r to create an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ -free and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ -free gas phase inside the vials. Thre e vials were spiked with $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas to create a $100\,\mathrm{ppm\;H_{2}}$ headspace ga s concentration, whereas the remaining three vials were kept $\Nu_{2}$ flushed. Additionally, six procedural blank samples composed o f $\Nu_{2}$ -flushed headspace vials were prepared. Three of these vials wer e similarly spiked with $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas to obtain a $100\,\mathrm{ppm}$ headspace gas concentration. After analysis of the initial $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentration, sample s were incubated at estimated in situ temperatures, and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentration was monitored as a time series. For each point in the tim e series, $500\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ headspace gas was extracted from the vial using a gastight syringe to measure $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentration. The extracted volume o f headspace gas was immediately replaced by an equal volume of pur e $\Nu_{2}$ gas to maintain constant pressure within the vial. We intend t o continue the incubation until the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentration remains unchanged with time, upon which a steady-state $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentration i s reached between $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ production and consumption. The above-described incubation method can be used to determine steady-stat e dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentrations if two requirements are fulfilled: (1) th e headspace gas is in equilibrium with the dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ in the sediment IW and (2) the incubation of the samples in the laboratory allows the establishment of a steady state between production an d consumption. The incubation method was originally developed t o monitor $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentrations in environments characterized by relatively high microbial activity (e.g., shallow sediment; see Hoehler, e t al., 1998). In the deep subseafloor sediments recovered from Hol e C0023A, we anticipate that metabolic rates of microbial communit y in situ might be a few orders of magnitude lower than those typically observed in shallow subsurface environments. Therefore, it i s questionable whether a steady state can be reached within the timeframe of the expedition, and if a steady state is reached, whether it i s representative of in situ conditions. If no steady state has bee n reached in the incubated samples during the time span of the expedition, the incubation period will be continued on shore.  

# Organic geochemistry  

Shipboard organic geochemical data provide crucial and complementary information to microbiological and inorganic geochemical studies, such as the type and quantity of organic substrates an d products of microbial activity. These enable the identification an d quantification of metabolic pathways that occur in situ. Postexpedition analyses of organic biomarker molecules, such as microbial membrane lipids and dipicolinic acid in endospores, will provid e additional information on the composition and scale of benthic microbial communities. With in situ temperatures reaching up t o $120^{\circ}C$ , thermal alteration of sedimentary organic matter is a highl y relevant geochemical process at Site C0023 and will be investigate d postcruise using methods such as pyrolysis-GC–mass spectrometr y (GC-MS).  

A wide range of gas, fluid, and solid-phase samples were collected for shipboard and postcruise research (Table T9). In addition, control samples were taken to account for different potential contamination sources, such as intrusion of drilling fluid into sediment cores and release of organics from the plastic core liner at elevated temperatures. The gas sampling program was a joint effort o f organic geochemists, inorganic geochemists, and microbiologist s and comprised samples for shipboard analysis of hydrocarbons $\left(C_{1}-\right.$ $C_{4})$ , $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ and CO (detailed in Inorganic geochemistry) and the drilling fluid tracer PFC (see Microbiology). Gas samples were als o taken for postcruise analysis of $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C-CO_{2}}$ and clumped and stabl e isotope analysis of free and sorbed hydrocarbon gases. Samples fo r dissolved organic matter analysis were collected from IW sample s (see Inorganic geochemistry).  

# Gas analyses  

# Gas sampling  

Shipboard investigations included safety gas monitoring an d high-resolution gas analysis in WRC samples using establishe d ODP/IODP protocols (Kvenvolden and McDonald, 1986; Pimmel and Claypool, 2001). Sampling was conducted immediately afte r core retrieval in the core cutting area and as soon as possible afte r core sections had been imaged by X-ray CT and cut into WRCs.  

Table T9. Overview of sample codes collected during gas and solid-phase sampling by Expedition 370 organic geochemists. Safety gas and void gas sampl e collection was time critical and thus they were collected immediately in the core cutting area before X-ray CT scanning of the cores. Community gas (COMGAS ) whole-round core (WRC) samples were collected in close proximity to WRCs for IW and microbiology community whole rounds (see Figure F21 for samplin g details). $\mathsf{P F C=}$ perfluorocarbon.

Usually this procedure was finished within $1\,\mathrm{~h~}$ after cores had arrived in the core cutting area. In addition, large volume sample s were occasionally taken from selected depths and processed shipboard to extract and sample hydrocarbon gases for postexpeditio n position-specific and clumped isotope analysis.  

# Sampling in the core cutting area  

Core samples for safety gas monitoring and samples for timesensitive contamination control of $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ CO, and PFC in drilling flui d were collected in the core cutting area immediately after core arriva l to avoid loss of gases during further core processing. The samplin g scheme is outlined in Figure F21 and sample codes are defined i n Table T9. For safety gas monitoring, approximately $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment was collected from the core catcher with a cut-off syringe fo r soft to semiconsolidated sediment or was chiseled out of the sediment core with a ceramic knife or chisel when the sediment becam e more lithified (deeper than 360 mbsf in Hole C0023A). Sedimen t samples were extruded or placed into a preweighed $21.6~\mathrm{mL}$ glas s vial (precombusted at $450^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ ) and immediately sealed with  a silicone septum (prebaked at $100^{\circ}C$ for $4~\mathrm{h}$ ) and metal crimp ca p (sample code HS). These samples were collected from the cor e catcher rather than the top of Section 1 as has been done durin g previous expeditions (e.g., Expedition 322 Scientists, 2010; Expedition 337 Scientists, 2013) in order to preserve the core sections fo r X-ray CT imaging. The contamination control comprised a set o f samples for $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO analysis (sample code 370RGA3) and PF C monitoring (sample code HSECDM) that were taken from the oute r part of the sediment core, which had been in contact with drillin g fluid, as well as a set of samples taken from the drilling fluid caugh t inside the core liner (sample code LCL) for microbiological an d chemical contamination control (see Microbiology), for PFC analysis (sample code HSECD), and for both $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO analysis (sampl e code 370RGA4). For $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO analysis, $\{{\sim}5\ \mathrm{cm}^{3}}$ of sediment or  5 mL of drilling fluid was placed in a $20~\mathrm{mL}$ vial filled with low $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ 1 8 MΩ water and stored upside down (see Inorganic geochemistry for a detailed description of sampling and analysis). For PFC analysis, ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment or $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of drilling fluid was transferred to  a $21.6~\mathrm{mL}$ glass vial, $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of $18\,\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water was added to the HSEC D sample, and the vials were immediately sealed with a silicone septum and metal crimp cap (see Microbiology for a detailed description of sampling and analysis). LCL samples were collected in steril e $50\,\mathrm{mL}$ Falcon tubes split into personal samples on the core processing deck. When voids were observed in HPCS and ESCS cores du e to the expansion of gases during recovery, void gas samples wer e collected in the core cutting area. Void gases were collected b y piercing the core liner with a custom piercing tool and allowing ga s to expand into a $60\,\mathrm{mL}$ gas-tight syringe connected to the tool. Bot h the syringe and piercing tool were flushed with helium prior t o piercing. This measure was taken to minimize contamination of th e void gas samples by air to allow for determination of in situ concentrations of ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ via measurement of $\mathrm{CH}_{4}/\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{N}_{2}/\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ratios (Spivack et al., 2006). Samples were then transferred into crimp-cappe d headspace vials prefilled with a saturated solution of $\mathrm{NaCl}$ for shipboard analysis of hydrocarbon gases (sample code VAC). Void ga s samples for postexpedition analysis of stable isotopes of $C O_{2}$ (sample code 370AIVG), hydrocarbon gases (sample code 370FSVG), and methane clumped isotopologues (sample code 370DTWVG ) were also collected.  

# Sampling on the core processing deck  

After X-ray CT imaging of the cores, $5{-}10~\mathrm{cm}$ long COMGA S WRC samples were taken for gas analysis as part of a complex sampling program in which samples for interdependent analyses wer e located next to each other. Typically, a WRC for gas analysis wa s collected adjacent to the IW sample and close to microbiolog y (MBIO1 and MBIO2) samples (Figure F21).  

A total of 141 COMGAS WRC slices were taken, averaging  1 COMGAS sample per $4\,\mathrm{m}$ of core. From each COMGAS WRC, th e following samples were collected for shipboard analysis (all sample s were collected from the center of the WRC unless otherwise stated; see also Figure F21):  

• One $\{{\sim}5\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}}$ sample for shipboard analysis of headspace hydrocarbon gases (sample code 370HS), treated in the same manner as the HS sample taken in the core cutting area (see Sampling in the core cutting area).  

Figure F21. Sampling scheme for gas analyses, Expedition 370. Section numbers, sample codes, and whole-round dimensions are shown. Void gases (VAC) an d samples for safety gas monitoring (HS) and contamination controls (370RGA3, 370RGA4, HSECD, HSECDM, and LCL) were directly collected in the core cuttin g area. Samples for gas and solid-phase analysis were collected from COMGAS WRCs typically taken adjacent to IW and microbiology community WRCs (MBIO 1 and MBIO2). For details, see text.

• Two $\{\sim}5\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ samples for shipboard analysis of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO (sample codes 370RGA1 and 370RGA2) (see Inorganic geochemistry); one $\{\sim}5\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample was also taken from the edge of the core to check for any drilling-induced contamination (sample code 370RGA5). These samples were treated in the same way as samples for $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO analysis taken in the core cutting area (sample codes 370RGA3 and 370RGA4) (see Sampling in the core cutting area).  

For postexpedition shore-based analysis, the following sample s were taken:  

• One ${\sim}5\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample for $\delta^{13}{\cal C}$ of DIC (sample code 370AIHS), which was completely filled with a saturated $\mathrm{NaCl}$ solution, sealed with a soft gray chlorobutyl stopper, and crimp capped. Within ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{h}$ after sampling, an artificial headspace was introduced by replacing $5\,\mathrm{mL}$ of NaCl solution with pure $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ -free $\Nu_{2}$ gas; vials were stored thereafter upside down at $4^{\circ}C$ (cf. Inagaki et al., 2015).   
• Two $\{{\sim}5\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}}$ samples for determination of concentrations and stable isotope ratios ( $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}$ and $\delta^{2}\mathrm{H}$ ) of free and sorbed $C_{1}-C_{5}$ hydrocarbons (sample codes 370FSHS1 and 370FSHS2). 370FSHS1 samples were stored in $5\,\mathrm{mL}$ of a $\mathrm{1\,M\,NaOH}$ solution, capped with a precleaned butyl stopper (heated to boiling with 1 M KOH for ${\sim}1\,\mathrm{h}$ and subsequently rinsed and left immersed with nanopure water overnight; cf. Oremland et al., 1987), and frozen upside down at $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (cf. Hinrichs et al., 2006; Ertefai et al., 2010). 370FSHS2 samples were treated in the same manner as 370AIHS samples.   
• A ${\sim}60\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample for development of a new method to determine in situ concentrations of $\mathrm{CH_{4}}$ (sample code 370DTWWR2). The ${\sim}60\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample was taken as a ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{cm}$ whole-round slice (or an equivalent volume of large pieces) from the top of the COMGAS sample, sealed in ESCAL gas-barrier film (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, Japan), and immediately frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .   
• Remaining material from the interior of the COMGAS sample was used for shipboard MAD (see Physical properties), XRD, XRF, and total carbon/inorganic carbon (sample codes XRD, XRF, and CARB) analyses of the solid phases (see below) and visual description (see Lithostratigraphy).  

# Sampling for position-specific and clumped isotope analysis  

One $10{-}80\,\mathrm{cm}$ WRC sample was taken at intervals of ${\sim}30{-}50\;\mathrm{m}$ (sample code 370DTWWR) for postexpedition extraction of $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ and $C_{2+}$ for measurement of the abundances of methane clumpe d isotopologues and position-specific $^{13}\mathrm{C}/^{12}\mathrm{C}$ ratios in propane, respectively (Ono et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Gilbert et al., 2016). This sample was either sealed in ESCAL gas-barrier film and store d at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ or placed into a glass container (Schott Duran GLS 80, 50 0 mL), sealed, flushed with He, and stored at $4^{\circ}C$ to determin e whether different methods of storage affect the gas concentrations.  

The determination of relative abundances of four stable isotopologues of methane $\mathrm{(^{12}C H_{4},\,^{13}C H_{4},\,^{12}C H_{3}D,}$ and a “clumped” isotopologue $\big[{}^{13}\mathrm{CH}_{3}\mathrm{D}])$ of 370DTWWR samples will occur postexpeditio n via tunable infrared laser spectroscopy. This analysis requires  a minimum of $40\,\upmu\mathrm{mol}$ of pure methane ( $\lceil\sim\!1\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at standard ambien t temperature and pressure [SATP]; $25\mathrm{{^\circC}}$ , 1 bar); the analysis is described in Ono et al. (2014) and Wang et al. (2015). The amount o f core material required was estimated from methane contents determined by headspace gas analyses. Core material assigned to sampl e code 370DTWWR had contiguous lengths ranging between 15 an d  

$73\,\mathrm{cm}$ (i.e., up to ${\sim}2,000\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment). Samples longer than ${\sim}40$ cm were usually divided into two or three portions, with each portion processed separately.  

Several different processing and storage methods were employed for 370DTWWR samples. A literature search conducte d prior to the expedition found no documented attempts to quantitatively extract methane from such large quantities of sediment cor e material during previous IODP expeditions. All procedures described here should be considered experimental; their effectivenes s must be further evaluated by postexpedition research. Most WR C samples were sealed in ESCAL gas-barrier film and immediatel y frozen at $-100^{\circ}$ or $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . For several samples, a custom purge an d trap apparatus was used to extract $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ and other gases from th e periphery of the core slices. These samples of WRCs were packed i n ESCAL gas-barrier film bags into which two standard-size hole s had been punched and across which stopcocks (GL Sciences) ha d been preinstalled. The gas-tight bags were flushed under a strea m of helium (at ${\sim}10{-}100\ \mathrm{cm^{3}\ S A T P/m i n)}$ through a series of two Utraps held at $-196^{\circ}C$ in liquid nitrogen. The first U-trap remove s water vapor, carbon dioxide, and $C_{2+}$ hydrocarbons. The second Utrap contained silica gel (Sigma-Aldrich, Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, USA), which adsorbs methane and air. After several minutes, th e stream of helium was stopped, the U-traps were isolated, and th e second U-trap was evacuated to remove noncondensable gases (primarily helium). Thereafter, the second U-trap was warmed to roo m temperature, the amount of trapped gases was quantified manometrically, and extracted gases were transferred to a gas-tight storag e flask containing silica gel held at $-196^{\circ}C.$ In many cases, the volum e of extracted gases was substantially higher than would be expecte d given the ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ contents in the sediments $_{<10~c\mathrm{m}^{3}}$ SATP) and exceeded the pressure limit of the manometer. Estimated trapped volumes were up to ${\sim}100~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , suggestive of possible entrainment o f atmospherically derived air during the helium flushing. Sample s were then resealed in ESCAL gas-barrier film and stored frozen a t $-100^{\circ}$ or $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ until extraction on shore. Some samples that wer e stored at $-100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ shipboard had to be transferred to a $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freeze r on shore because of space limitations.  

Several other WRC samples were placed in Schott Duran GL S 80 bottles sealed with custom rubber stoppers. The headspace wa s briefly flushed with helium, and the bottles were then stored at $4^{\circ}C$ until extraction on shore.  

# Hydrocarbon gas analysis  

Concentrations and distributions of light hydrocarbon gases, including methane ( ${\mathrm{C}}_{1}$ or $\mathrm{{CH}_{4}},$ ), ethene/ethylene $\left(C_{2=}\right)$ , ethane $\left(C_{2}\right)$ , propene/propylene $\left(C_{3=}\right)$ , propane $\left(C_{3}\right)$ , $_i$ -butane $\left(i-\mathsf{C}_{4}\right)$ , and $_n$ -butane $\left(n{-}C_{4}\right)$ were monitored following standard headspace (sampl e code HS) gas sampling and analysis procedures (Kvenvolden an d McDonald, 1986). The IODP pollution prevention and safety protocol (JOIDES Pollution Prevention and Safety Panel, 1992; Shipboar d Scientific Party, 1994; Fritz, 1980), required by IODP safety regulations, was modified as described below to better constrain the concentrations and ratios of dissolved gases. Hereby, we followed th e approaches that were employed during previous expeditions with  a strong biogeochemical focus, in particular ODP Legs 164 and 20 1 (Hoehler et al., 2000; Shipboard Scientific Party, 2003) and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 301, 307, 311, 322, an d 337 (Expedition 301 Scientists, 2005; Expedition 307 Scientists, 2006; Expedition 311 Scientists, 2006; Expedition 322 Scientists, 2010; Expedition 337 Scientists, 2013).  

For shipboard $C_{1}{\mathrm{-}}C_{4}$ hydrocarbon gas analysis of HS and 370H S samples, the vial was placed in an Agilent Technologies 7697 A headspace sampler, where it was heated to $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$ before a n aliquot of the headspace gas was automatically injected into an Agilent 7890B GC equipped with a packed column (HP PLOT-Q) an d flame  ionization  detector  (FID).  He  was  the  carrier  gas  (1 0 $\mathsf{c m}^{3}/\mathsf{m i n})$ ). VAC samples were injected directly on the GC colum n without prior heating. After injection, the initial column oven temperature of $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ was ramped at a rate of $10^{\circ}C/\mathrm{min}$ to $150^{\circ}C$ . Chromatographic response of the FID was calibrated with commercia l standards containing $1.0\,\times\,10^{4}\;\mathrm{ppm}$ (by volume) of each of $C_{1},\,C_{2},$ $C_{3},$ and $i{-}/n{-}\mathrm{C}_{4}$ alkanes (standard gas Type X, GL Sciences, Japan), as well as the $C_{2}-C_{3}$ alkenes $\mathrm{\Delta}C_{2=}$ and $C_{3=};$ standard gas Type XI, G L Sciences, Japan). Linearity of the FID response was verified usin g five different standards (standard gas Types VIII–XII, GL Sciences, Japan) with variable quantities of $\mathrm{C_{1}},\,\mathrm{C_{2=}},\,\mathrm{C_{2}},\,\mathrm{C_{3=}},\,\mathrm{C_{3}},\,i{-}\mathrm{C_{4}},$ and $n{\mathrm{-}}C_{4}$ $(10^{2}–10^{5}\,\mathrm{ppm})$ . The response of the FID, checked on a daily basis vi a analysis of Type X standard, was stable within $\pm6\%$ for the duratio n of the expedition. Blanks of laboratory air consistently showed 2. 1 ppm ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ (close to the atmospheric concentration, $1.9~\mathsf{p p m})$ ), an d occasionally contained detectable amounts of ${\sf C}_{3=}$ , up to ${\sim}0.3~\mathrm{ppm})$ ); other hydrocarbons were consistently below detection $(<\!0.01\,\,\mathrm{ppm})$ . The high propene blank is likely related to the use of polypropylen e disposable syringes during preparation of samples (Kuley, 1963), and thus the $C_{3=}$ data are suspect.  

Methane concentration in IW was derived from the headspac e concentration using a mass balance approach (modified from Expedition 322 Scientists, 2010):  

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{4}=[\chi_{\mathrm{M}}\times P_{\mathrm{atm}}\times V_{\mathrm{H}}]/[\mathrm{R}\times T\times V_{\mathrm{pw}}],
$$  

where  

$\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{M}}=$ molar fraction of methane in the headspace gas (obtained from GC-FID analysis),   
$P_{\mathrm{atm}}=$ pressure in the vial headspace (assumed to be the measured atmospheric pressure when the vials were sealed),   
$V_{\mathrm{{H}}}=$ volume of headspace in the sample vial,   
${\mathbb R}=$ universal gas constant $8.314\times10^{-2}$ L·bar/mol·K),   
$T\!=$ temperature of the vial headspace in Kelvin, and   
$V_{\mathrm{pw}}=$ volume of pore water in the sediment sample.  

The volume of IW in the sediment sample ( $V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ was determine d based on the mass of the bulk wet sample $\left(M_{\mathrm{b}}\right)$ , the sediment’s porosity $(\Phi)$ , taken from shipboard MAD measurements in adjacen t samples), grain density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{g}})$ , and the density of pore water $\l(\rho_{\mathrm{pw}})$ :  

$$
V_{\mathrm{pw}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/\rho_{\mathrm{pw}}=\Phi\times M_{\mathrm{b}}/[\Phi\times\rho_{\mathrm{pw}}+(1-\Phi)\rho_{\mathrm{g}}],
$$  

where  

$M_{\mathrm{pw}}=\mathrm{mass}$ of pore water in the sample, $\rho_{\mathrm{pw}}=1.024\:\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3};$ , and   
$\rho_{s}=2.8\:\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

The volume of headspace in the sample vial $\left(V_{\mathrm{H}}\right)$ was determined by the difference between the total volume of the vial $\left(V_{\mathrm{vial}}\right)$ and the volume of the bulk sediment sample $(V_{\mathrm{b}})$ :  

$$
V_{\mathrm{H}}=V_{\mathrm{vial}}-V_{\mathrm{b}}=V_{\mathrm{vial}}-M_{\mathrm{b}}/\uprho_{\mathrm{b}},
$$  

where  

# $V_{\mathrm{vial}}=21.6~\mathrm{cm}^{3},$ , and $\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{b}}=$ bulk density of the sediment (from MAD data).  

After measurement of the headspace gas content via GC-FID , the mass of the bulk wet sample $\left(M_{\mathrm{b}}\right)$ was measured. Sample mas s was determined to a precision of $0.01\ \mathrm{g}$ using two electronic balances and a computer averaging system that compensates for shi p motion (Ocean High Technology Institute, Inc., Tokyo, Japan).  

# Solid-phase analysis  

For solid-phase analyses, samples were collected from the sam e WRCs as the gas samples (COMGAS samples). The solid-phas e program comprised the shipboard analysis of total carbonate content and elemental analysis of total carbon (TC), nitrogen (TN), an d sulfur (TS) (Pimmel and Claypool, 2001). Neither GC-MS analyse s nor Rock-Eval pyrolysis (Espitalié et al., 1977) were performed shipboard because the analytical instrumentation was not availabl e during this expedition. Instead, these analyses will be conducte d postcruise together with further characterization of organic matte r by pyrolysis-GC-MS.  

# Inorganic carbon content  

Inorganic carbon (IC) concentrations were measured using  a Coulometrics $5012\,\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ coulometer. Approximately $40~\mathrm{mg}$ $\pm5~\mathrm{mg})$ of powdered core sample was accurately weighed using two electronic balances and a computer averaging system that compensate s for ship motion (Ocean High Technology Institute, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and subsequently reacted with $6.5~\mathrm{mL}$ of 2 M HCl. The liberated $C O_{2}$ was  reacted  with  a  solution  containing  exces s monoethanolamine, forming the carbamate salt of monoethanolamine. This solution was titrated with electrochemically generate d $\mathrm{OH^{-}}$ to a colorimetric end point, and the change in light transmittance was monitored with a photodetection cell. The weight percentage of calcium carbonate was calculated from the IC content, assuming that all the evolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ was derived from dissolution o f calcium carbonate, using the following equation:  

$$
\mathrm{CaCO_{3}\left(w t^{\%}\right)=I C\left(w t^{\%}\right)\times100/12.}
$$  

No correction was made for the presence of other carbonat e minerals. Standard reference materials (National Institute of Standards and Technology standard reference material 88b and JSd-2 ) were used to monitor analytical precision (standard deviation [SD ] $<\,\pm0.1\,\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ . The detection limit for this method was estimated a t $0.03\;\mathrm{wt}\%\;\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ (three times the SD of the blanks).  

# Total carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents  

Samples were collected at an average resolution of 1 sample pe r $4\,\mathrm{m}_{}$ , depending on core recovery and length, for the shipboard analysis of TC, TN, and TS contents. These samples were collected directly from each COMGAS sample ${\sim}3~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ wet volume) togethe r with samples for XRF ( ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ wet volume) and XRD $\mathrm{{\sim}5\;c m^{3}}$ we t volume). The COMGAS sample was typically taken directly adjacent to IW samples to provide IW, gas, and elemental data fro m horizons as closely paired as possible (see above; Figure F21). Fo r TC and TN contents, samples were freeze-dried, powdered, and approximately $40~\mathrm{mg}$ $\mathsf{(\pm5~m g)}$ was accurately weighed into tin cups, which were carefully folded. For TS analysis, approximately $20~\mathrm{mg}$ $\pm5\;\mathrm{mg})$ of sample was accurately weighed into a second tin cup an d mixed with an equivalent mass of $\mathrm{V}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{5}$ catalyst. Analysis was conducted using a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1112 carbon-hydrogennitrogen-sulfur (CHNS) analyzer, where the sample was combuste d $(1000^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ in a stream of $\mathrm{O}_{2},$ nitrogen oxides were reduced to $\mathrm{N}_{2},$ an d the mixture of $\mathrm{CO}_{2},\mathrm{N}_{2},$ , and $S\mathrm{O}_{2}$ gases was separated by GC and detected by a thermal conductivity detector. A calibration standar d (sulfanilamide; $41.81\,\mathrm{wt}\%\,(\$ C, $16.27\,\mathrm{wt}\%\,\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{z}}$ , and $18.62\,\mathrm{wt}\%\,\mathrm{S}$ ) and tw o reference materials (soil NCS reference material [Thermo Scientific, Milan, Italy] and JMS-1 reference material) were used to monitor analytical precision $\left(\mathrm{SD}<\pm0.1\%\right)$ .  

Total organic carbon (TOC) contents were calculated by subtraction of IC from TC contents as determined by elemental analysis. Furthermore, the TOC/TN atomic ratio was determined as  a source indicator of the organic matter.  

# Contamination tests  

Ensuring strict QA/QC was an essential part of this expeditio n due to (1) the goal of evaluating low-biomass indigenous microbia l communities in the deep and hot sedimentary biosphere (see Introduction) and (2) the potential release of organic material from th e plastic liner used during coring at high temperatures. Organic compounds that might be released include stabilizers and antioxidant s that have the potential to contaminate future organic geochemica l analyses. In our QC, two possible sources of contamination of th e cored samples during drilling were considered: (1) input of microbial biomass by the seawater-based drilling fluid (see Microbiology), and (2) the release of plasticizers from the plastic core liner t o the core interior, induced by high in situ temperatures of up t o ${\sim}120^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at the top of the basaltic basement. In order to account fo r this source of contamination, we collected drilling fluid (sampl e code HSECDM), core material (sample code HSECD), and sample s of core liner, typically from the top of the core in the core cuttin g area (Figure F21). Samples from mud tanks were also taken thre e times as a baseline reference for organic components introduced b y drilling fluid.  

# Microbiology  

During Expedition 370, high-quality core sampling and microbiological analyses were undertaken by shipboard and shore-base d microbiologists using super-clean technologies on the Chikyu an d at KCC, respectively. All processing was subjected to rigorous Q A and QC. In order to minimize potential contamination of cored materials during sample processing and storage, all microbiologica l samples that we considered critical for exploring the limits of th e deep biosphere at Site C0023 were transferred to the shore-base d research facility at KCC by helicopter. The shore-based expeditio n scientists immediately processed and investigated these samples i n KCC’s super-clean laboratory using state-of-the-art microbiologica l techniques. Analyses conducted during the expedition period included quantification of microbial cells and molecular ecologica l studies using environmental DNA extracted from cored samples, al l accompanied by thorough chemical and microbiological contamination tests. In addition, time-sensitive experiments were initiate d that will continue beyond the end of the expedition, such as activit y measurements using radioactive and stable isotopic tracers and cultivation of subseafloor microorganisms in both batch and highpressure and high-temperature bioreactors. Moreover, sample s were carefully prepared for postcruise research projects that include but are not limited to in-depth molecular analyses using “omics”  approaches  (i.e.,  iTAG  sequencing  and  metagenomics), cultivation with a continuous flow bioreactor, and probing microbial activity using nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry.  

Complementary to core samples, a large number of control samples were obtained to evaluate potential contamination that migh t have occurred during either coring operations in the borehole o r core sampling and subsequent experiments in the laboratory. Thes e contamination control samples provide crucial baseline information for determining the analytical background of the anticipate d low-biomass deep biosphere samples. The methods for samplin g and QA/QC approaches used during Expedition 370 are describe d in the following sections.  

# Quality assurance and quality control for sample processing  

Microbiological sampling during Expedition 370 was highl y mindful of contamination control. Rigorous QA and QC was implemented for all steps involved in core recovery, core processing, an d sample analysis. Careful measures were taken to account for the introduction of microbial cells and viruses into the pristine sedimen t and rock samples from the following potential sources of contamination:  

• Intrusion of seawater and drilling mud during core cutting and recovery, potentially paired with cross contamination resulting from loose borehole fills accumulating on the bottom of the hole;   
• Introduction of microbial cells and chemical compounds from equipment and chemicals used during sample processing; and   
• Contamination of sediment samples during laboratory work from airborne particles.  

# Work flow and QA during microbiological sampling on the Chikyu  

To minimize the risk of drilling-induced contamination, samples for microbiological investigations were taken as WRCs fro m the most undisturbed parts of the recovered core sections. Thes e were identified by the Co-Chief Scientists and sedimentolog y watchdogs based on visual inspection and X-ray CT imaging of individual core sections. In general, the first section was not sample d for microbiological investigations in order to avoid cross contamination with borehole fills. Sampling of WRCs for shipboard, shorebased, and postcruise microbiological and geochemical investigations was based on a closely coordinated WRC sampling plan wher e all WRCs were cut from intact core sections in a concerted way i n the QA/QC laboratory immediately after X-ray CT imaging.  

During cutting, sediment only came in contact with precleane d (with $18\;\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water) and autoclaved spatulas. WRCs were packe d with end caps that had been cleaned with ethanol, dried in a clea n bench, and radiated with UV light for at least $20\ \mathrm{min}$ prior to use. Samples that required further processing were transferred either t o an anaerobic chamber (95:5 [v/v] $\mathrm{N}_{2};\mathrm{H}_{2}$ atmosphere; COY Laboratory Products, USA) or to a clean bench, depending on sampling requirements. A KOACH T 500-F tabletop air filtration unit (Figur e F22) was installed in both the anaerobic chamber and clean bench. The KOACH T 500-F unit produces filtered laminar airflow, creating conditions that match ISO Class 1 clean room standards. A n ionizer was also installed inside the anaerobic chamber to reduc e static attraction of potentially contaminating airborne particles. Airborne particles in the anaerobic chamber, clean bench, and surrounding laboratory air were periodically monitored throughou t the expedition (see below). Interior surfaces of the anaerobic chamber were routinely decontaminated by wiping with RNase AWAY. Interior surfaces of the clean bench were decontaminated by exposure to UV light. In addition, the working surface was covered wit h a fresh sheet of aluminum foil each time a new WRC was processed. All microbiological samples were collected using precleaned (wit h $18\,{\mathrm{M}}\Omega$ water) and sterilized tools, such as cut-off syringes, cerami c knives, and spatulas, depending on the hardness of the core material. Sampling tools were sterilized by autoclaving. The nitrogen ga s used to flush samples to be stored under anaerobic and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ -free conditions was filtered with a $0.22~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ filter to remove potential contamination.  

# Work flow and QA during microbiological sampling at KCC  

At KCC, initial sampling of refrigerated and frozen samples wa s conducted inside an anaerobic chamber (COY Laboratory Products, USA) with a KOACH T 500-F tabletop laminar flow air filtration unit or an all air exhaust clean bench, respectively. To avoi d static attraction of potentially contaminating airborne particles, a n ionizer (Winstat air ionizer, BF-X2MB; Shinshido Electrostatic Ltd., Japan) was placed in both the anaerobic chamber and clean benc h working environment to neutralize the surface charge of equipmen t and airborne particles. The working surface was covered with precombusted ( $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $5\;\mathrm{h}$ ) aluminum foil; tools for sampling (ceramic knives, spatulas, and spoons) were autoclaved and replace d whenever potential contamination by contact with a nonsterile surface was suspected. RNase AWAY and ethanol were liberally used t o sterilize all equipment, surfaces, and gloves not in direct contac t with samples inside the anaerobic chamber.

Figure F23. Super-clean room at KCC. A. Clean working area for sample processing. B. Floor KOACH Ez units for super-clean room.  

Further processing of samples, including crushing into powder , cell separation and filtration for counting, and DNA extraction wa s conducted in a super-clean room at KCC (Figure F23). The superclean room is equipped with a Floor KOACH Ez that produces horizontal ISO Class 1 quality of laminar airflow from the end wall o f the clean space. All of the clean experiments were conducted upstream, in front of the KOACH clean units, and electronic equipment  (centrifuges,  refrigerator,  and  sonicator)  was  place d downstream of the clean space. To neutralize the static electricity o f the samples, plastic equipment, and gloves (hands), a bar-typ e sheath-sensing ionizer (SJ-H180, Keyence, Japan) was placed approximately $40\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ above the working area of the stainless steel laboratory  bench  (Figure  F24).  The  ionizer  was  operated  at   a frequency of $1\ \mathrm{Hz}$ so that static charge was effectively neutralize d throughout the workspace of the workbench $\mathrm{^{1800}\,m m\times750\;m m},$ ). The static elimination capacity was routinely checked with highprecision electrostatic sensors (SK-H055 and SK-J050, Keyence, Japan) by checking the time required to neutralize $1~\mathrm{kV}$ of charge. Static charge was consistently reduced to ${<}10\%$ within $_{30\,\mathrm{s}}$ .  

# QC: assessing potential contamination of sediment samples from airborne particles during laboratory work Monitoring airborne particles  

Shipboard airborne particles with a size range of $0.3{-}1.0~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ were enumerated with a Met One HHPC $^{3+}$ airborne particl e counter (Met One Instruments, Inc.; Grants Pass, Oregon, USA). Air was sampled for 1 min at a flow rate of $2.8\;\mathrm{L/min}$ . Particle subfractions of $>0.3,\;>0.5,$ , and $>\!1\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ were recorded. Particle count s were performed in the clean bench and the COY anaerobic chamber for each core (i.e., after cleaning and before processing of a ne w core in the WRC sectioning area). At each time point, ambient laboratory air was also sampled for comparison (Figures F25, F26). Ai r quality was also measured in the shore-based laboratories an d workspaces at KCC using a Biotest particle counter (9303-01BT).  

# Monitoring airborne microbial cells  

To quantify the concentration of airborne microbial cells tha t may potentially contaminate cores during shipboard core handling, cells in $^\mathrm{~1~L~}$ of air were counted from various workspaces: (1) th e QA/QC laboratory, (2) the microbiology laboratory, (3) the UVsterilized hood (i.e., clean bench) equipped with a KOACH air purification system, and (4) the COY anaerobic chamber also equippe d

with a KOACH air purification system. At KCC, $^{1\,\mathrm{L}}$ of air was sampled at the following workspaces: (1) the clean bench in the superclean room, (2) the COY anaerobic chamber equipped with  a KOACH air purification system, and (3) the super-clean room, where unfiltered laboratory air was also sampled. To collect cell s from a $^\textrm{\scriptsize1L}$ volume of air, $50~\mathrm{mL}$ of air was sampled via a syring e through a $0.2\;{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ polycarbonate membrane in a syringe filter housing (Swinnex Filter Holder, $25~\mathrm{mm},$ , Merck Millipore) and this procedure  was  repeated  20  times  (Figure  F27;  Table  T10). Formaldehyde fixation solution $4\%$ in $3\%\ \mathrm{NaCl}$ solution) was subsequently applied to the filter and incubated at room temperatur e for $10{-}20\ \mathrm{min}$ to fix cells. Fixation solution was then purged fro m the polycarbonate membrane using $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of KOACH sterile air wit h a $0.22\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ pore-sized polyethersulfone (PES) filter (Millex-GP filte r unit, Merck Millipore). The filters were stored at $4^{\circ}C$ in sterilize d plastic bags until further processing and cell counting at KCC.

# QC: assessing potential contamination of sediment samples from drilling fluid during coring  

The use of drilling fluid during coring operations is necessar y for a number of reasons, including cleaning of the borehole fro m cuttings, cooling of the drill bit, and ensuring borehole stability. Three types of drilling fluid contamination samples were collecte d for biological and chemical contamination analyses: the fluid contacting the core samples, drilling fluid from the delivery pump, an d drilling fluid at the preparation tank as shown below.  

# Drilling fluid as a potential source of contamination  

Drilling fluids are composed of seawater and varying amounts o f chemical compounds, all of which are potential sources of microbial cells, viruses, and chemical contamination into low-biomass cor e samples (see Masui et al., 2008). The composition of the drillin g fluid is adjusted during operations to optimize drilling performanc e (Figure F28). To account for the intrusion of drilling fluid into th e core, a PFC compound is added as a chemical tracer to the drillin g fluid before pumping it down the borehole (Smith et al., 2000a, 2000b). During RCB operations, drilling fluid caught inside the cor e liner (sample code LCL) was sampled when cores were cut int o sections in the core cutting area immediately after retrieval (se e Sampling in the core cutting area; Figure F21). LCL samples wer e used to monitor the input concentration of PFC and changes i n numbers and community structure of microbial cells and viruse s during drilling operations and sample recovery (Table T10). In addition, drilling fluid from Pump 2 (drilling fluid from deliver y pump) and seawater gel from active mud tanks (drilling fluid a t preparation tanks) were sampled once per day to assess the abundance of microbial cells and viruses in the drilling fluid. More information on the composition of drilling fluids is available in th e Technical Report of Expedition 370 (Center of Deep Earth Exploration, 2016). A conceptual overview of drilling fluid circulatio n during riserless drilling on the Chikyu and fluid sampling points i s shown in Figure F28, and a summary of terms and acronyms i s found in Table T11.

Sampling for biological assessment of drilling fluid contamination  

For enumeration of microbial cells, $1{-}2\,\mathrm{~mL}$ of LCL sample s were fixed with prefiltered $?0.22\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ pore-sized PES filter) salin e formaldehyde solution $\langle3\%\ \mathrm{NaCl}$ and $4\%$ formaldehyde) and store d at $4^{\circ}C$ . For enumeration of virus-like particles (VLP), $1{-}2\ \mathrm{mL}$ o f LCL samples were fixed with virus-free $(0.02~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ filtered; Anodisc, GE) saline formaldehyde solution, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Suttle and Furhman, 2010). In addition, samples of drilling fluid from Pump 2, seawater gel, and LCL wer e frozen and stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for onshore DNA-based assessment o f core sample drilling fluid contamination.  

To assess potential infiltration of microbial cells and VLPs fro m drilling fluid into the interior of cores, $1\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ samples were periodically taken for enumeration of cells and VLPs from the interior, midway, and exterior portions of a subsection of MBIO1 WRCs. The samples were collected inside the COY anaerobic chamber using sterile tools (cut-off syringes, sterile ceramic knives, and othe r tools, depending on the hardness of the material) and placed int o Falcon tubes. For cell enumeration, the samples were fixed in prefiltered $(0.22\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ saline formaldehyde solution and stored at $4^{\circ}C$ . Fo r virus enumeration, the samples were fixed in prefiltered $(0.02~{\upmu\mathrm{m}})$ saline formaldehyde solution, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and store d at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

# Monitoring contamination by drilling fluid with PFC  

A PFC-based tracer contamination test was first implemented i n terrestrial subsurface environment exploration (Colwell et al., 1992 ) and was adopted during ODP Leg 185 to provide an estimate of th e drilling fluid intrusion into the core interior (Smith et al., 2000a, 2000b). Since then, PFC has frequently been used as a chemical tracer during scientific ocean drilling, including on the R/V JOIDE S Resolution (Smith et al., 2000a, 2000b; House et al., 2003; Lever e t al., 2006) and the Chikyu (Yanagawa et al., 2013; Inagaki et al., 2015). During Expedition 370, we used the compound perfluoromethylcyclohexane $\left(\mathsf{C}_{7}\mathsf{F}_{14}\right)$ as the PFC chemical tracer. In the main pum p room, PFC was supplied via a high-pressure liquid chromatograph y (HPLC) pump into the drilling fluid at the inlet of charge Pump 2. The HPLC pump supplied a constant flow rate of $0.6~\mathrm{mL/min}$ o f $94\%$ pure PFC. During drilling operations, flow in the borehole wa s adjusted, using up to three charge pumps; therefore, the input PF C concentration varied depending on the Pump 2 flow rate and its relative ratio to the total flow rate.

To verify and quantify the presence of PFC in the drilling fluid, LCL samples were taken when the core sections were cut in the cor e cutting area unless no fluid was caught in the core liner. LCL samples that were collected into $50\;\mathrm{mL}$ Falcon tubes in the core cuttin g area and then sampled into headspace vials ( $\mathrm{\sim}5\,\mathrm{mL}$ fluid into $20\;\mathrm{mL}$ vials) in the microbiology laboratory were designated as FAL- L samples (Table T11). LCL samples collected directly into headspac e vials $\mathrm{[\sim5~mL}$ fluid into $20\;\mathrm{mL}$ vials; sample code HSECDM; see als o Table T9 and Figure F21) were designated as CCA-L samples. Moreover, solid-phase samples (designated as CCA-S samples; sample code HSECD) were taken from the top of Section 1 for ever y core, starting at Core 370-C0023A-34R in the core cutting area (Figure F29) in order to have a means of comparison of PFC concentration between all cores if liner fluid was not present. This quic k sampling scheme immediately after core recovery aimed to avoi d PFC loss while cores underwent curation and X-ray CT image scanning.  

To determine the potential diffusion of drilling fluid into the interior of cores, three solid-phase samples $({\sim}2\,\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ were taken fro m the exterior (EX), midway (MD), and interior (IN) portion of th e core cross section from every MBIO2 WRC (Figure F29; Tabl e T11). In soft sediments, the samples were taken from the disk wit h $\mathsf{a}\,5\,\mathrm{mL}$ cut-off sterilized syringe. In hard sediments (after Core 14X), the exterior sample and then the interior and midway samples wer e scraped out of the disk with a ceramic knife. Cores 111R and 112 R were not monitored for the presence of PFC because the core material consisted of small basaltic pieces. Each sediment sample wa s placed in a $20\;\mathrm{mL}$ headspace vial, $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of water was added, and th e vial was immediately crimp capped with a Teflon-coated silica septum. Sample weights (CCA-S, IN, MD, and EX) were determine d using two electronic balances and a computer averaging system tha t compensates for ship motion (Ocean High Technology Institute, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The volumes of LCL samples (FAL-L and CCAL) were estimated by comparison with reference vials.  

At KCC, routine PFC sampling was conducted as an integra l part of sample processing. Scrapings of WRC samples that wer e processed in an anaerobic chamber, as well as the innermost part o f WRCs were also subjected to PFC measurements (see Shore-base d sampling procedure below).  

All samples were vortexed for 2 min each to create a slurry an d enhance PFC release into the headspace. Vials were then mounte d onto a rotating wheel and incubated at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for at least $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . Following incubation, vials were placed in an Agilent G1888 networ k headspace sampler (shipboard and at KCC) that incubated vials a t $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for an additional $30\ \mathrm{min}$ before injection. In the autosampler, $0.5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of the headspace was transferred into an Agilent 7890B G C (7890A GC at KCC) coupled to an electron capture detector (ECD). Samples were injected at $180^{\circ}C$ with a split ratio of 1:5. The shipboard GC-ECD was equipped with a GS-GasPro column $30\mathrm{~m~}\times$ $0.32\ \mathrm{mm}$ , Agilent, USA) and was operated with a constant heliu m flow rate of $3.4~\mathrm{mL/min}$ . The initial oven temperature was set t o $120^{\circ}C$ , followed by a $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ increase to a $180^{\circ}C$ final temperatur e that was held for $3.5\ \mathrm{min}$ . After the $6.5~\mathrm{min}$ sample run, a postru n was started at $200^{\circ}C$ for $15\;\mathrm{min}$ and a final equilibration time of 1. 5 min, equaling a total run time of $23\,\mathrm{\min}$ per sample. The shorebased GC-ECD was also equipped with a GS-GasPro column an d operated at the same conditions as the shipboard GC-ECD until 1 1 October 2016, when it was changed to an HP-ALM column ( $\,\!\,30\,\mathrm{m}\times$

Figure F29. Sampling scheme for microbiological community WRCs (MBIO1 and MBIO2). Samples for cell/virus counts for comparison with PFC analysis fro m MBIO1 WRCs and for contamination tests for organic substances derived from core liner from MBIO2 WRCs were taken every 10 cores. Sample IDs in J-CORE S database are shown in parentheses.  

$0.53\ \mathrm{mm}$ , Agilent, USA) operated with a constant helium flow rat e of $4.8~\mathrm{mL/min}$ (Smith et al., 2000a). For the HP-ALM column, th e initial oven temperature was set to $120^{\circ}C$ , followed by a $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ increase to $150^{\circ}C$ final temperature that was held for $20\;\mathrm{min}$ , equaling a total run time of $22\,\mathrm{{min}}$ per sample.  

For quantification of PFC in the samples, a five-point calibratio n curve was prepared by mixing liquid PFC solution $94\%$ purity an d $1.787~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ density) with methanol to create stock solutions fro m $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-4}$ (PFC:methanol $[\mathbf{v}/\mathbf{v}].$ ) (see EXP370_PFC_CALIBRATION_CURVE.XLSX in MBIO in Supplementary material). Fro m this stock solution, $10\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ was transferred to an empty $20~\mathrm{mL}$ headspace vial, resulting in standard PFC headspace concentration s from $8.4\times10^{-3}$ to $8.4\times10^{1}\,\upmu\mathrm{g/L}$ . The shipboard GC-ECD detectio n limit $({\sim}1.6\,\times\,10^{-3}\mathrm{~\textmug/L}$ PFC in headspace; area ${\sim}10$ ) was about a n order of magnitude lower than the lowest calibration standard use d in the curve. The linearity of the standard curve was separatel y checked at KCC down to $8.4\times10^{-4}\,\upmu\mathrm{g/L}$ PFC in headspace, whic h was defined as the lower limit of quantification (LOQ). For sediments, this corresponds to an average LOQ of PFC of $8.4\,\times\,10^{-6}$ $\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sediment (assumptions: $4\,\mathrm{g}$ sediment, $2\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ density, addition of $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ water, and $20~\mathrm{mL}$ headspace crimp vial). Linearity wa s assumed for all samples between the highest standard of the calibration curve $(8.4\times10^{1}~\upmu\mathrm{g/L}$ PFC in headspace) and detector saturation. Whenever oversaturation of the detector was observed,  a defined amount of heated headspace gas was transferred into a ne w empty headspace vial and reanalyzed.  

PFC concentration was calculated according to the procedur e outlined by Expedition 337 Scientists (2013). In brief, for fluid samples, the headspace PFC concentration was multiplied by the via l volume and then divided by the sample volume. For sediment samples, the headspace PFC concentration was multiplied by the via l volume and then divided by the sample mass. PFC concentration i n sediments was then converted from $\upmu\mathrm{g}~\,\mathrm{PFC}/\mathrm{g}$ sediment to $\upmu\mathrm{g}$ $\mathrm{PFC}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ using the core-specific MAD data (see Physical properties in the Site C0023 chapter [Heuer et al., 2017b]).  

# Shipboard WRC sampling for microbiological investigations and experiments  

# WRC sampling for microbiological investigations  

WRCs for microbiological investigations were taken accordin g to the expedition’s WRC sampling plan immediately after core retrieval and X-ray CT imaging of core sections on the core processing deck. Depending on requested storage conditions, WRCs fo r microbiological investigations were either anaerobically packed an d flushed with $\Nu_{2}$ gas into ESCAL gas-barrier bags prior to vacuumsealing (V-301G, Fuji Impulse, Japan) or sealed aerobically withou t $\Nu_{2}$ flushing. The packed WRC was then placed into a secondar y gas-tight aluminum bag and vacuum-sealed following flushing wit h nitrogen gas.  

WRCs for sampling and expeditionary analyses (referred to a s “community ${\mathrm{WRCs}}^{\prime\prime})$ were typically $30~\mathrm{{cm}}$ long, and generally tw o adjacent WRC sections (MBIO1 and MBIO2) were taken from eac h $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ core interval (Figure F29). MBIO1 was stored and transferre d at refrigerated $(4^{\circ}C)$ conditions for cell and virus counts, cell visualization, enzymatic  activity,  and  enrichment  (Table  T12),  an d MBIO2 was deep frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for molecular analysis and viru s visualization (Table T13). MBIO1 and MBIO2 WRC processing wa s immediately carried out in anaerobic and aerobic super-clean conditions, respectively (see Quality assurance and quality contro l for sample processing).  

The surface of each MBIO1 WRC was scraped using sterilize d ceramic knives in the anaerobic chamber. After that, a disk sampl e was taken from MBIO1 and MBIO2 and samples were taken for microbiological, enzymatic, and organic geochemical investigations; contamination tests by PFC; and organic geochemistry (Figur e F29). MBIO1 WRCs and personal samples were placed into ESCA L bags and temporarily clipped closed within the anaerobic chamber. The bags were removed from the chamber, immediately flushe d with nitrogen gas to remove $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas, and vacuum-sealed. MBIO 1 WRCs were then stored at $4^{\circ}C$ and personal samples were stored a t requested temperatures. MBIO2 WRCs were removed from cor e liners in the clean bench. The WRCs were placed into ESCAL bags, sealed without nitrogen gas flushing, frozen by the shipboard Cell s Alive System (CAS) freezer (Abi Co. Ltd., Japan; see Morono et al., 2015), and stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .

Redox-sensitive WRC samples used for activity measurement s and shore-based/postexpedition cultivation were processed in th e anaerobic chamber. After removing the outer surface with steril e ceramic knives, samples were placed into ESCAL bags. The bag s were removed from the anaerobic chamber, flushed once with $\Nu_{2}$ t o remove $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas, vacuum-sealed, and stored at requested temperatures prior to shipping.  

# Preparation of WRC samples for potential metabolic activity determination with radiotracers  

For shipboard determination of potential metabolic activity (i.e., sulfate reduction and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis) using radioisotopes, WRC samples (approximately $10\ \ c\mathrm{m}$ long)  wer e scraped, stored, and further processed under anaerobic condition s when a sufficient number of samples had been collected. In the anaerobic chamber (95:5 [v/v] $\mathrm{N}_{2};\mathrm{H}_{2}.$ ), another ${\sim}2{-}3\ \mathrm{mm}$ was scrape d from the WRC surface with a sterile ceramic knife. The innermos t part of the core was chopped off with the knife to create a mixture o f very small sediment chips and powder. Approximately $5~\mathrm{mL}$ of thi s chipped sediment was placed into a $20\;\mathrm{mL}$ crimp vial to which $5\,\mathrm{mL}$ of either methanogenic (sulfate-free, $\mathrm{1\mM\NaHCO_{3}}$ ) or sulfate reducing $\mathit{^{(5\ m M\ S O_{4}^{\ 2-}}}$ , $5\mathrm{\mM\NaHCO_{3}}$ ) medium was added. Thre e replicate vials were prepared from each sample for both methanogenesis and sulfate reduction rate determination, respectively. Vial s were crimp-sealed with nontoxic blue chlorobutyl stoppers (Bellco ) and aluminum crimps. After sealing, the vial headspace was flushe d with $\Nu_{2}$ gas to remove surplus hydrogen, followed by the addition o f $40\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ $\mathrm{N}_{2};\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas $(95{:}5\;[\mathrm{v/v}])$ to provide approximately $400\,\mathrm{nM}$ of dissolved hydrogen to the liquid phase. All vials and stoppers were autoclaved, and solutions were either autoclaved or filtered throug h sterile syringe filters $0.20\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ pore sized) prior to use.  

In the radioisotope laboratory on the Chikyu, $10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of radiolabeled $\mathrm{(^{35}S)}$ $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ (3.7 MBq) and $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of radiolabeled $(^{14}\mathrm{C})$ NaH$\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ (3.7  MBq)  were  injected  into  sulfate  reduction  an d methanogenesis samples, respectively, followed by vigorous shaking. Samples were incubated at temperatures within the estimate d in situ range: $40^{\circ}C$ for 360 mbsf or shallower, $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for 405–58 5 mbsf, $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for 604–775 mbsf, and $95\mathrm{^\circC}$ for 816 mbsf or deeper. After a maximum 10 days of incubation, $3~\mathrm{mL}$ of $20\%$ (w/v) zinc acetate solution was injected into each sulfate reduction vial to tra p produced $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ gas. Vials were thoroughly shaken before they wer e opened to transfer the sediment slurries to $50\;\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tube s containing $7~\mathrm{mL}$ of $20\%$ (w/v) zinc acetate solution. Tubes wer e shaken and frozen immediately at $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to stop microbial activit y and shipped to GFZ Potsdam (Germany) after the expedition fo r analysis. Methanogenic activity was stopped by injecting $500~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ o f $50\%$ (w/v) sodium hydroxide into each methanogenesis vial followed by shaking. Samples were then shipped to Aarhus Universit y (Denmark) for analysis. Sediment controls for both methods wer e incubated without radiotracer addition. Radiotracer was then adde d after microbial activity was stopped in order to check for abiotic reactions after incubation. Negative controls ( $^{5\mathrm{\mL}}$ sterile mediu m and no sediment) and drilling fluid controls $\mathrm{~5~mL~}$ core liner fluid, drilling fluid from Pump 2, and seawater gel) were incubated at th e same experimental conditions to check for nonbiological reaction s from the negative controls and biological reactions originating fro m drilling fluid, respectively.  

Artificial seawater medium for sediment slurry incubations wa s prepared as follows. The subsequent salts were each added to two  2 L glass bottles (one bottle for sulfate reducing medium and one fo r methanogenic medium):  

• $400\mathrm{\:mg\:KH_{2}P O_{4}}$   
• $500\;\mathrm{mg}\;\mathrm{NH}_{4}\mathrm{Cl}$   
• $\mathrm{1\;g\,MgCl_{2}{\cdot}6H_{2}O}$   
$\bullet\ 1\ \mathrm{g\KCl},300\mathrm{\mg\CaCl_{2}\mathrm{\cdot}2H_{2}O}$   
• $50\;\mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{NaCl}$  

In addition, $1.42\mathrm{\g\Na_{2}S O_{4}}$ was added to only the sulfate reducing medium. The bottles were filled to $2\,\mathrm{~L~}$ with ultrapure $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ . Some drops of resazurin solution $(0.1\%\;[\mathrm{w/v}])$ were added. The bottles were covered (but not completely closed) with a screw cap an d autoclaved. After autoclaving, the medium was purged with $\Nu_{2}$ ga s while still hot $(>\!60^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . During purging, 10 and $2~\mathrm{mL}$ of sterile filtered $\mathrm{NaHCO_{3}}$ solution $\mathrm{(84~g~NaHCO_{3}}$ in 100 mL $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}.$ ) was adde d to the sulfate reducing medium and methanogenic medium, respectively. When necessary, $\mathsf{p H}$ was adjusted with sterile filtered $6.5\%$ HCl or NaOH solution to $\mathrm{pH}\,7.5$ . The bottles were then cappe d with a sterile butyl stopper and a screw cap, and ${\sim}3~\mathrm{mL}$ of steril e filtered $\mathrm{Na}_{2}S$ solution ( $\mathrm{1.2\,\,g\,\,Na_{2}S}$ in $100\,\mathrm{~mL~}$ $\mathrm{{H}_{2}O)}$ ) was adde d through the stopper with a syringe to reduce the medium. Reduction was confirmed by the decoloration of the resazurin in solution.  

# Sample shipment to KCC  

MBIO1 and MBIO2 WRCs were transported by helicopter t o KCC at a frequency of six flights per week on average to ensur e rapid processing and minimize potential bias due to the effects o f prolonged storage after core retrieval. During transit, WRCs wer e stored in thermally insulated bags to maintain the temperatures a t which they were temporarily stored on the ship.  

# Shore-based WRC sampling for microbiological investigations and experiments at KCC  

# Shore-based sampling procedure  

All sample surfaces of MBIO1 WRCs had been prescraped o n the Chikyu to prevent diffusion of potential contaminants from seawater and drilling fluid further into the core during storage an d transport. The received samples ranged in length from approximately 10 to $30~\mathrm{{cm}}$ WRC equivalent. The range of sample qualit y and coherency varied, especially at shallower depths. To furthe r minimize the potential contamination of core samples, the oute r layer of prescraped core $\mathrm{{\sim}}5\,\mathrm{{\mm}}$ thickness) was removed agai n from all surfaces of hard and intact WRCs, including the surface o f cracks through the core, using a sterile ceramic knife in an anaerobic chamber following the QA/QC routines described in Qualit y assurance and quality control for sample processing. A sample o f the removed surface material was collected for PFC analysis (KC C secondary scrapings), and the rest was archived. From the remaining core, an intact $1{-}2\,\mathrm{cm}$ whole-round slice was cut with a cerami c knife for structural visualization analysis. Next, the integrity of samples for cell and virus counts were prioritized: for this the core wa s placed inside a sterile bag, mounted in a holding clamp, and a minicore sample was taken from the center of the core using a core dril l with a sterilized core bit to obtain the cleanest sample possible. Thi s minicore was divided in half and stored according to Table T12. Drilling usually caused disintegration of the remaining core withi n the sterile bag, and the subsequent samples were taken from the disintegrated pieces using a spatula. Any remaining scraped sampl e was saved as “Internal” core in a new sterile bag, flushed with $\Nu_{2}$ i n a heat-sealed aluminum bag, and then stored at $4^{\circ}C$ . If the receive d WRCs were soft but intact, the same procedure was followed, except that cut-off syringes were used in place of the minicore drill. I f the WRCs were not intact, surface scraping was not possible, an d samples were taken directly using cut-off syringes. Treatment fo r individual samples is given in Table T12.  

Anaerobically stored CAS-frozen MBIO2 WRCs were first cu t into two WRC pieces when the WRC was longer than $12\,\mathrm{cm}$ using  a band saw with an electron-deposited diamond coated edge, locate d inside a clean booth equipped with two HEPA filter units (Masui e t al., 2009; Morono and Inagaki, 2016). Anaerobically stored MBIO 2 WRCs shorter than $12~\mathrm{{cm}}$ were not cut. The surface of the WR C was briefly flamed to soften the sediment, allowing the removal o f its surface by scraping with a sterile spatula in an effort to preven t surface contaminants from touching the subcore. A subcore wa s then aseptically taken from the center of the frozen WRC sampl e using a tabletop $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ diameter minicore drill. The subcore was further sectioned for DNA extraction, virus visualization, and PF C analysis and stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ prior to the analysis. The volume an d treatment of the subcores are described in Table T13.  

# Cell counts  

All sample preparation for cell counting was carried out in th e super-clean room at KCC. Cell count samples of drilling fluids (se e Drilling fluid as a potential source of contamination) and LC L were diluted with $2.5\%$ sodium chloride and directly filtered ont o polycarbonate membranes (Millipore, USA). Sediment samples fo r cell counts were crushed into powder using ceramic mortars an d pestles, which were combusted at $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $^\textrm{\scriptsize5h}$ prior to use. Approximately $10~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ of powdered sediment was transferred into  a sterile $50\;\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tube containing $20~\mathrm{mL}$ of $3\%$ $(\mathrm{w/v})$ sodiu m chloride, with $10\%$ $(\mathrm{v/v})$ neutralized formalin (containing $3.8\%$ formaldehyde) as a fixative, and then thoroughly mixed by vortexin g to form a homogeneous suspension. The slurry sample was the n subjected to the cell detachment and separation steps as follows:  

1. An aliquot of $1\;\mathrm{mL}$ diluted paraformaldehyde (PFA)-fixed sediment slurry was put into a $15\;\mathrm{mL}$ tube. Then $1.4~\mathrm{mL}$ of $2.5\%$ NaCl, $300\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of detergent mix $100\;\mathrm{mM}$ ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid [EDTA], $100\;\mathrm{mM}$ sodium pyrophosphate, $1\%\ [\mathrm{v/v}]$ Tween-80), and $300\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of pure methanol were added. The sample was shaken by the Shake Master (Bio Medical Science, Japan) at $500\;\mathrm{rpm}$ for $60\;\mathrm{min}$ .   
2. The slurry sample was sonicated at $160\;\mathrm{W}$ for $_{30\,\mathrm{s}}$ for 10 cycles (Bioruptor UCD-250HSA; Cosmo Bio, Japan).   
3. The sample was loaded onto density layers composed of $30\%$ Nycodenz $(1.15\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ ), $50\%$ Nycodenz $(1.25\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , $80\%$ Nycodenz $(1.42\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , and $67\%$ sodium polytungstate $(2.08\;\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ , which were prepared by overlaying lighter density solution onto heavy layers.   
4. Cells and sediment particles were then separated by centrifugation at $10{,}000{\times}g$ for $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $25\mathrm{{^\circC}}$ with swinging rotors.   
5. The light density layer that might contain microbial cells was carefully collected using a 20G needle syringe.   
6. The heavy fraction, including precipitated sediment particles, was washed by resuspending with $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of $2.5\%\;\mathrm{NaCl}$ , and then centrifuged at $5000\times g$ for $15\,\mathrm{{min}}$ at $25\mathrm{{^C}C}.$ . The recovered supernatant was placed on the same cell fraction obtained above (i.e., Step 5).   
7. The precipitated sediment was resuspended in $2.1~\mathrm{mL}$ of $2.5\%$ NaCl, $300~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of detergent mix, and $300\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of methanol. Then the sample was shaken at $500\;\mathrm{rpm}$ for $60\,\mathrm{{min}}$ at $25\mathrm{{^\circC}}$ .   
8. The slurry sample was layered onto a second density gradient with $30\%$ Nycodenz, $50\%$ Nycodenz, $80\%$ Nycodenz, and $67\%$ sodium polytungstate (same as Step 3).   
9. Cells and sediment particles were then separated by centrifugation at $10{,}000{\times}g$ for $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $25\mathrm{{^\circC}}$ with swinging rotors.   
10. The light density layer that might contain microbial cells was collected using a 20G needle syringe, and all the supernatants were mixed together as a cell suspension for cell count.  

The half-aliquot of the supernatant was passed through a 0.2 2 $\upmu\mathrm{m}$ polycarbonate membrane filter. Cells on the membrane filte r were stained with SYBR Green I staining solution (1/40 of SYB R Green I in Tris-EDTA [TE] buffer). The number of SYBR Green I– stained cells was enumerated either by direct microscopic coun t (Inagaki et al., 2015) or a fluorescent image-based cell counting system as described in Morono et al. (2009) and Morono and Inagak i (2010).  

# Visualization of cells with electron microscopy  

Some density separates from core samples were subjected t o further purification by cell sorting (Morono et al., 2013). Cells in  a density separate were first trapped onto an Anodisc membran e (Whatmann, USA) and stained with SYBR Green I. After resuspension by gentle sonication, cells were specifically sorted by a Mofl o cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, USA) directly onto a silicon nitrid e (SiN) membrane.  

One microliter of filtered seawater containing $2.5\%$ glutaraldehyde was dropped on the SiN membrane with the sorted cells, which were then fixed for $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $4^{\circ}C$ in a humid chamber. The sample was washed 6 times for $10\ \mathrm{min}$ with $1~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ drop of filtered seawater at $4^{\circ}C$ in a humid chamber. Subsequently, the sample wa s postfixed and contrast was enhanced using the osmium and tanni c acid procedure (Kajikawa et al., 1975; Bastini et al., 1984). First, $1\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of filtered $2\%$ osmium tetroxide solution was dropped on the Si N membrane for $^{1\,\mathrm{h}}$ at $4^{\circ}C$ in a humid chamber and washed 6 time s for $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ with $1\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ drop of distilled water at $4^{\circ}C$ in a humid chamber. After that, $1\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of filtered $3\%$ tannic acid solution at $\mathsf{p H}\,6.8$ wa s dropped on the SiN membrane, incubated for $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $4^{\circ}C$ in a humi d chamber, and then the membrane was washed 6 times for $10\ \mathrm{min}$ with $1~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ drop of distilled water at $4^{\circ}C$ in a humid chamber. Afte r washing, $1\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of filtered $2\%$ osmium tetroxide solution was furthe r dropped on SiN membrane for $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $4^{\circ}C$ in a humid chamber an d washed 6 times again for $10\;\mathrm{{min}}$ with $1\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ drop of distilled water i n a humid chamber. The staining work was done by onshore collaborator Dr. Goichiro Uramoto at KCC (Kochi University, Japan).  

The location of stained cells on a SiN membrane was checke d with a fluorescence microscope based on the SYBR Green I–derived green fluorescence, and the same location was observed wit h transmission electron microscopy (JEM-ARM200F, JEOL, Japan ) operated by onshore collaborator Dr. Naotaka Tomioka at KC C (JAMSTEC).  

# DNA extraction  

A frozen sediment sample collected by minicore drilling wa s crushed into powder using a ceramic mortar and pestle, which wer e precombusted at $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $^\textrm{\scriptsize5h}$ to eliminate exogeneous contaminant DNA. DNA was extracted from $\,5\mathrm{~g~}$ of the crushed sedimen t using a PowerLyzer PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (MO BIO Laboratories, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions wit h modifications. All kit components were irradiated by gamma ray t o eliminate endogenous DNA contamination prior to use. Zirconiu m beads were substituted for the garnet beads in the kit to enhance cel l disruption efficiency. The obtained DNA was further concentrate d by ethanol precipitation by adding $10\%$ $(\mathbf{v}/\mathbf{v})$ of $3\,\mathrm{M}$ sodium acetate, $250\%$ $(\mathbf{v}/\mathbf{v})$ of absolute ethanol, and $20~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of linear acrylamid e (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to the DNA solution and incubatin g overnight at $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . DNA was precipitated by centrifugation a t $10{,}000{\times}g$ for $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ followed by washing twice with $70\%$ ethanol. Th e precipitated DNA was dissolved in $50\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of TE buffer and stored a t $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for subsequent analyses.  

# PCR, sequencing, and data analysis  

For determining microbial taxonomic composition and community structure, the V4 region of the bacterial and archaeal 16S rRN A genes was amplified by PCR using U515F–U806R primers (Tabl e T14). PCR amplifications were performed on Veriti Thermal Cyclers or StepOnePlus Thermal Cyclers (Thermo Fisher Scientific ) using MightyAmp DNA polymerase ver.3 (Takara Bio) following th e manufacturer’s instructions with $2~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of the extracted DNA. Th e first round PCR thermal cycles consisted of initial denaturation fo r $2\,\mathrm{{min}}$ at $98^{\circ}{C},$ followed by 35 cycles of 5 s denaturation at $95\mathrm{^\circC_{\mathrm{i}}}$ , $15\,s$ annealing at $55^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , and 30 s elongation at $68^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The obtained PC R products  were  purified  using  AMPure  XP  beads  (Beckma n Coulter). Adaptor and index sequences were added to the purifie d amplification products by 2nd round PCR using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix with 515F-MiSeq and 806R-MiSeq primers according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Second round PCR cycle s consisted of initial denaturation at $95\mathrm{^\circC}$ for $3\ \mathrm{min}$ , followed by 1 0 cycles of $_{30\,\mathsf{s}}$ denaturation at $95\mathrm{^\circC_{\mathrm{i}}}$ , 30 s annealing at $55^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , 30 s elongation at $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{:}$ , and final elongation at $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for 5 min. We purifie d the PCR product twice using AMPure XP beads and measured th e concentration of DNA using a NanoDrop 3300 fluorospectromete r with PicoGreen reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Based on th e measured concentrations, an equal amount of each purified product was pooled to make a sequence library. We sequenced the library on an MiSeq platform using a MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 in a 600- cycle format (Illumina).  

Microbial diversity based on the obtained 16S rRNA gene assemblages was analyzed using the MetaAmp pipeline developed b y Dong and Strous (unpublished, http://ebg.ucalgary.ca/metaamp).

# High-pressure/temperature incubation  

Innermost sediment core samples were taken from WRCs (sample code 370YMWR) for shore-based stable isotope probing incubation experiments under high-pressure and high-temperatur e conditions at KCC. Stable isotope–labeled compounds $\mathrm{(^{13}C,\ ^{15}N,}$ and deuterium [D]) were used as substrates to monitor the microbial dissimilatory respiration and/or the assimilation into cellula r biomass.  

For the high-temperature/pressure (high-P/T) incubation, w e set up a custom-made high-P/T chamber system with a heat jacke t (Syn Corporation, Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). The high- $\cdot\mathrm{P}/\mathrm{T}$ chamber system is composed of five titanium-based pressure chamber units, th e inner temperature of which can be controlled separately (see Figur e F30). Each of the pressure chambers holds four inner incubatio n units, which consist of a polyetheretherketone (PEEK) tube (15 5 mm long and $24~\mathrm{mm~ID}$ ), PEEK upper stopper, and PEEK free piston. The PEEK upper stopper and PEEK free piston each have tw o O-rings. The PEEK upper stoppers are connected to the stainles s steel tube $\mathrm{(100~mm\times0.2~mm~ID)}$ through the lid of the pressur e chamber. The other end of the stainless steel tube is connected to  a stainless steel syringe for substrate injection and fluid samplin g into/from the inner cell under high- $\mathrm{\nabla{P/T}}$ conditions. Five pressur e chambers are connected to a cylinder pump (Teledyne Isco, NE, USA, 100D, $100~\mathrm{mL}$ ) to maintain constant pressure throughout th e incubation period. A thermal circulator (Julabo, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) is connected to the heat jacket of each high-P/ T chamber to maintain the designated temperature condition.  

In the anaerobic chamber, ${\sim}50~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment was taken fro m each of 11 WRC samples, which were collected from 660 to 85 5 mbsf. The sediment powder was obtained by scraping an interio r piece of the WRC with a sterilized ceramic knife and then mixe d thoroughly to make a master sample. A $30\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ aliquot of the maste r sediment sample was put in each of the inner incubation units at

tached to the lid of the high-P/T chamber. After $35~\mathrm{mL}$ of a basa l medium (see Table T15) was added to each of the inner incubatio n units, they were sealed with the PEEK free piston and then transferred from the anaerobic chamber to the high-P/T chambers. Th e high-P/T chambers were then preheated to $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and pressurized t o $55\;\mathrm{MPa}$ by a hand pump for the leak check. After completion of th e leak check, the cylinder pump was activated to maintain a constan t pressure at $55~\mathrm{MPa}$ . Then, each heater deployed on the five high$\mathrm{P/T}$ chambers was set at $80^{\circ}$ , $95^{\circ}$ , $110^{\circ}$ , $125^{\circ}$ , and $140^{\circ}C_{:}$ , respectively. After every chamber reached the designated incubation temperature, $0.7~\mathrm{mL}$ of substrate solution (see Table T16) was injected int o each inner incubation unit using a stainless steel syringe. Becaus e there was void space in the connecting line, $2~\mathrm{mL}$ of the basal medium was injected to push the solution into the inner incubatio n unit after the injection of the substrate solution. The injected volume of the substrates or medium solutions was monitored by th e cylinder pump through the volume of water pulled out from eac h high-P/T chamber to compensate for the added liquid volume. During the incubation, $2~\mathrm{mL}$ of fluid samples was periodically collected using a stainless steel syringe to determine the carbon isotopic composition of methane and DIC. After sampling, $2~\mathrm{mL}$ of th e basal media was supplemented to the inner incubation unit usin g the stainless steel syringe to keep the liquid volume constant in th e sample chamber. Two milliliters of sampled fluid was transferred t o $\mathrm{}_{1}\,5\,\mathrm{mL}$ glass vial from the stainless syringe through a needle. Befor e the fluid was added, $20~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of phosphoric acid was added to the vial then it was covered with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminu m cap and vacuumed with an oil rotary vacuum pump through a needle.

# Sampling for postexpedition investigations Cultivation experiments  

WRC samples were prepared for postexpedition cultivation experiments by shipboard microbiologists. The contaminated outermost surface of each WRC was removed using a sterilized cerami c knife. The clean inner portions were stored in glass bottles, flushe d with $\mathrm{N}_{2},$ and sealed with rubber butyl stoppers. Alternatively, samples were packed in gas-tight ESCAL bags, which were flushed wit h $\Nu_{2}$ and vacuum-sealed. All samples were stored at either $4^{\circ}C$ o r room temperature (approximately $23^{\circ}C$ ) in the dark prior to shorebased cultivation experiments.  

# Scanning electron microscopy  

On the Chikyu, approximately $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment was sample d from the interior of the PFC disk under the KOACH system in th e clean bench for scanning electron microscopy to determine characteristics of microbe–mineral attachment. These samples were preserved in $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of $2.5\%$ glutaraldehyde and stored at $4^{\circ}C$ . Another  5 $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment was sampled from the interior disk in the superclean anaerobic chamber for further postexpedition cultivatio n work, including enrichment of iron-reducing bacteria and methanogens. Future experiments will examine preferential attachment o f deep subsurface enrichment cultures to the minerals present in th e core material. All fixed samples will be imaged under a JEOL JSM7100F field-emission SEM at $3~\mathrm{kV}.$ The elemental composition o f the minerals will be determined using dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.

# Environmental tag sequencing and metagenomics  

To study the extent and adaptations of the deep subseafloor biosphere characterized by increasing in situ temperature to a depth o f 1180 mbsf, WRCs were taken and cleaned on the Chikyu for DNA - and RNA-based molecular analyses. According to biomass estimates, different amounts of sample will be used to extract DNA an d RNA using methods specifically developed for low-biomass dee p sediments (e.g., Lever et al., 2015). Amplicon tag sequencing of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes will be performed using  a MiSeq sequencer (Illumina) in order to characterize the microbia l taxonomic diversity and community structure. Other persona l deep-frozen WRC samples (e.g., sample codes 370LLWR an d 370THWR) were dedicated to molecular ecological studies, including sequence analysis of PCR-amplified key functional genes, an d molecular quantification using the digital PCR technique (Hoshin o and Inagaki, 2012), as well as cultivation-dependent and -independent metagenomic and transcriptomic analyses.  

# Bio-orthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging  

Recently developed methods to detect in situ protein synthesi s were applied by shipboard microbiologists. Following the protoco l of Hatzenpichler et al. (2014), we introduced an artificial amino aci d analog (L-homopropargylglycine [HPG]; Click Chemistry Tools), into selected WRCs after core processing and preparation for incubation. This artificial amino acid, substituting for methionine, coul d be used to detect in situ microbial activity, as the alkyne moiety o n HPG will readily react with appropriate fluorescent azide dyes upo n dye introduction into the incubation, thus enabling an investigato r to detect microbial protein synthesis via fluorescence of a given biosynthesizing microbe. Downstream reaction of HPG with alkyn e dyes accompanied by microscopy and cell sorting was planned fo r incubation processing postcruise.  

# Microbe–mineral interactions  

To reveal microscale ecological partitioning within the sediments, shipboard microbiologists prepared WRC samples for separation of minerals using density and magnetic techniques followin g the methods of Harrison and Orphan (2012). Postcruise, densit y separation will be performed using different dilutions of a sodiu m metatungstate $\mathrm{(H_{2}N a_{6}O_{40}W_{12})}$ solution, allowing for partitioning o f sediment particles into different fractions corresponding to thei r density. Partitions will be further separated by magnetic susceptibility using a Frantz L-1 isodynamic magnetic separator. DNA will b e subsequently extracted from these partitions, amplified by PCR, and sequenced using Illumina iTAG technology. This will enable th e examination of microbial attachment to different clays, the surfac e properties of which are known to exhibit important controls ove r carbon burial (Mayer, 1994), as well as microbial attachment t o authigenic clays or silica phases, which may control the smectite– illite transition through reduction of octahedral Fe (Vorhies an d Gaines, 2009) or modulation of dissolved silica activities (Abercrombie et al., 1994).  

# Virus analyses  

Samples for VLP enumeration were processed in the shorebased super-clean room at KCC. Postcruise, viruses will be detached from sediment by the same method as samples for cell separation and enumeration (see Cell counts). The mixture of detache d cells and viruses will be filtered $.0.22\;\upmu\mathrm{m},$ , polyvinylidene difluorid e [PVDF], Millipore) to remove cells. The viruses will be filtered ont o $0.02\ \upmu\mathrm{{m}}$ pore-sized aluminum oxide filters (Anodisc, GE) an d stained with SYBR Gold ( $25\times$ concentration) for $15\;\mathrm{\min}$ . Th e stained filters will be mounted onto glass slides with an antifad e mounting medium (VECTASHIELD, Vector Labs) and observed b y epifluorescence microscopy at $1000\times$ magnification. Viruses will b e enumerated from 20 random fields of view (FOVs) or until 200 particles are enumerated. The abundance of viruses will be calculate d from the average number of viral particles per FOV.  

Potential viral contamination deriving from drilling fluid wil l also be assessed by enumerating drilling fluid samples that hav e been fixed in formaldehyde and frozen in liquid nitrogen (Suttle an d Furhman, 2010). The fixed and frozen drilling fluid samples wer e stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ until analysis at KCC.  

Samples for electron microscopy analysis of infected cells wer e taken on shore at KCC from MBIO2 WRCs, which had been froze n on board in a CAS freezer (Morono et al., 2015).  

# Temperature-induced plasticity of metabolism  

Sediment samples $(5{-}20\ \mathrm{cm}\ \mathrm{WRCs};$ ; sample code 370HLWR ) had the external surface removed on the Chikyu to prevent furthe r potential penetration of drilling fluid contaminants. They wer e maintained in anaerobic conditions and sent to KCC in sterile, airtight packaging. There, samples were subjected to a second round o f surface removal in the super-clean anaerobic chamber before bein g crushed to a coarse powder. An aliquot of this powder was fixe d with formaldehyde and set aside as sample $\mathrm{T}_{0}$ . Another aliquot wa s set aside for potential future experiments, and the rest was stored i n anaerobic and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ -free conditions prior to inoculation to the medium that contains stable isotope–labeled substrates (see below).  

Incubation volumes ranged from $120\;\mathrm{mL}$ for the shallower sediment samples to $1000~\mathrm{{mL}}$ for the deeper samples to partially account for the decrease in apparent cell densities and maximize th e potential to generate measurable material. The incubation mediu m was anaerobic sterile artificial seawater $\mathrm{(5\%\[v/v]\D_{2}O)}$ , with $^{15}\mathrm{N}\mathrm{H}_{4}^{+}$ $(50\%\ [\mathrm{v/v}])$ as the nitrogen source and acetate as the carbon substrate and electron donor. Sulfate $\mathrm{5~mM})$ was included for sulfat e reduction.  

Postcruise, the isotopic composition of $C O_{2}$ in the headspac e will be monitored to ascertain when the lag phase ends and exponential growth begins. Once exponential growth begins, samples o f liquid medium will be extracted using a sterile needle and syringe a t 3 time points at approximately 1 month intervals, fixed with formaldehyde, and stored for analysis. At the end of the incubation period, fixed cells will be fluorescently stained, sorted from sediment wit h flow cytometry, and mounted upon conductive membranes, an d the isotopic composition of cells will be analyzed using secondar y ion mass spectrometry to assess the incorporation rate of isotopically labeled substrate (Morono et al., 2011).  

# High-temperature enrichment of thermophilic endospore– forming microorganisms  

At KCC, sediment $\left(35\,\mathrm{\textrm{g}}\right)$ from WRC samples (sample cod e 370MCWR) was pasteurized at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ and anaerobically incubated at $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{:}$ , or $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in $70\;\mathrm{mL}$ of artificial seawater mediu m (Widdel and Bak, 1992; Isaksen et al., 1994) amended with the organic acids lactate, propionate, succinate, acetate, formate, and butyrate, each to a final concentration of $1~\mathrm{~mM}$ , to enrich fo r thermophilic endospore–forming microorganisms. The microcosms were incubated for 21 days. They were sampled daily for th e first 6 days of incubation. Sampling decreased in frequency betwee n 6 and 21 days of incubation. Samples will be used for downstrea m molecular and genetic analysis. These analyses will include th e monitoring of molecular indicators of anaerobic growth, such as organic acid measurement and sulfate measurement, and microbia l community profiling, such as 16S rRNA gene and functional gen e sequencing.  

# Exoenzyme activity  

At KCC, enzyme activity was measured by supplying fluorogenic substrate, which produces fluorescence only after the functional group is cleaved by the relevant enzyme. This results in a n increase in fluorescence over time when substrate concentration s are saturating. Activities were obtained by sampling each incubation at two or three time points and measuring fluorescence to obtain a slope. Each sample was run with a standard curve o f fluorescent moiety (methylumbelliferone [MUF] or 7-amino-4- methylcoumarin [AMC]) in order to obtain absolute units of substrate cleaved.  

Incubations were set up by placing $15~\mathrm{mL}$ of sediment slurr y containing ${\sim}10~\mathrm{g}$ (exact mass determined) of powdered sedimen t and anaerobic $\mathbf{P}$ -free artificial seawater into $30\,\mathrm{~mL~}$ serum vial s sealed with blue butyl rubber stoppers. Sediment crushing and incubation setup was carried out in an anaerobic chamber and via l headspace was flushed with $\Nu_{2}$ . Substrate was then added at estimated enzyme-saturating concentrations (see Table T17)  

After flushing the headspace, $700\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of homogenized slurry wa s removed to a $1.5~\mathrm{mL}$ Eppendorf tube to serve as time point zero. This was briefly centrifuged before removing the supernatant t o read in triplicate on a plate-reading fluorometer with an excitatio n wavelength of $380\,\mathrm{nm}$ and an emission wavelength of $454\;\mathrm{nm}$ for al l substrates and standards. Subsequent time points were taken after  2 weeks and then again at 4–6 weeks to generate an activity slope. During this time, the incubations were kept at near–in situ temperatures. Fluorescence of MUF and AMC is at a maximum at p H 10, so $67~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of $50\;\mathrm{mM}$ sodium tetraborate $\left({\mathsf{p H}}\,10.8\right)$ was added t o each well to be read on the plate reader.  

# Biological core archives (DeepBIOS)  

During Expedition 370, we collected ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm}$ WRCs for longterm storage at KCC (Masui et al., 2009). These legacy archiv e cores, denoted “DeepBIOS” (sample code 370RMS), will be used fo r future biological investigation upon request. DeepBIOS WRCs wer e
