# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 35 8 was carried out from October 2018 through March 2019 on the D/ V Chikyu in an attempt to reach a plate boundary fault zone at seismogenic depths for the first time in scientific ocean drilling. The goa l was to extend Hole C0002P from ${\sim}2900$ to ${\sim}5200$ meters below seafloor (mbsf) and cross the seismically interpreted main décollemen t fault zone with logging while drilling (LWD), downhole stress measurements, cuttings sampling, mud gas sampling, and partial corin g by drilling a sidetrack to create a new hole (C0002Q). Althoug h drilling reached 3262.5 mbsf, the deepest to date in all of scientifi c ocean drilling, the effort to drill to and sample the target—th e megathrust fault zone—was not successful. Operational challenge s in establishing sidetrack holes and advancing them at reasonabl e rates of penetration limited the new cased hole interval to less tha n $60\;\mathrm{m}$ total at a depth shallower than the previously established casing depth of 2922 mbsf. Combined, the cuttings, logs, and ${\sim}60~\mathrm{cm}$ of recovered core from sidetrack Holes C0002Q–C0002T reveale d hemipelagic sediments and fine silty turbidites consistent in lithology and physical properties with those recovered in the same dept h interval at the same site during Integrated Ocean Drilling Progra m Expedition 348. Cuttings revealed evidence of only weakly deformed rock, with relatively common calcite veins but few othe r structural indicators. Because no downhole leak-off tests wer e made and very little borehole imaging was performed, no furthe r insight into the tectonic context was acquired.  

After riser drilling at Site C0002 was terminated, drilling at alternate contingency Sites C0024 and C0025 was carried out. Sit e C0024 targeted the frontal thrust region to sample and log hangin g wall rocks and the shallow portion of the décollement zone, and Sit e C0025 accessed sediments in the Kumano fore-arc basin. At Sit e C0024, a dedicated logging hole was drilled and a very complet e suite of logs were acquired from 0 to 869 mbsf. Preliminary interpretation of log response and images suggests the frontal thrus t zone was encountered from about 813 mbsf to the base of the hole, with a zone of notably low resistivity and steep bedding from 85 0 mbsf to the bottom of the hole. Core samples revealed lithologi c units interpreted to be hemipelagic and turbiditic basin fill, trenc h fill, and Shikoku Basin sediments and encountered deformation potentially associated with a back thrust imaged in seismic reflectio n data. However, coring had to be terminated at about 620 mbsf, wel l short of the frontal thrust zone. Site C0025 recovered fore-arc basi n sediments underlain by those interpreted to have been deposited i n a trench-slope basin setting; no clear transition into older, inner accretionary wedge material was identified during preliminary analysis. Coring from 400 to 571 mbsf yielded datable material an d possible evidence for diapiric intrusion of sediments.  

# Introduction and background  

The Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) program is a coordinated, multiexpedition drilling projec t designed to investigate fault mechanics and seismogenesis along th e Nankai subduction megathrust (Figure F1) through direct sampling, in situ measurements, and long-term monitoring in conjunction with allied laboratory and numerical modeling studies (Tobi n and Kinoshita, 2006; Tobin et al., 2015a, 2019). The fundamenta l scientific objectives of the NanTroSEIZE project include characterizing the nature of fault slip and strain accumulation, fault and wal l rock composition, fault architecture, and state variables throughou t the active plate boundary system. Eleven previous expeditions hav e been carried out, establishing a transect of sites from the incomin g (subducting) plate through fault zone and accretionary wedge characterization and into the central fore-arc basin (Figure F2). For reviews  of  many of the principal results from these sites, se e Underwood and Moore (2012), Ujiie and Kimura (2014), and Tobi n et al. (2015b, 2019).  

Site C0002 is located in the Kumano fore-arc basin above th e seismogenic, partially locked portion of the plate boundary thrus t system (Figures F1, F2, F3). The Kumano Basin sedimentary sequence and uppermost part of the accretionary prism were drilled, logged, and sampled during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 314 (logging while drilling [LWD] to 1401.5 meters belo w seafloor [mbsf]), 315 (coring to 1057 mbsf), 338 (LWD to 2005 mbs f and coring to 1120 mbsf), and 348 (LWD to 3058.5 mbsf, with limited coring from 2163 to 2218.5 mbsf) (Expedition 314 Scientists, 2009; Expedition 315 Scientists, 2009; Strasser et al., 2014; Tobin e t al., 2015b).  

The principal goal of International Ocean Discovery Progra m (IODP) Expedition 358 was to reach and sample the reflector identified as the likely plate boundary fault at Site C0002 by extendin g the riser borehole (Hole C0002P) established during previous Integrated Ocean Drilling Program NanTroSEIZE expeditions (Figur e F3). This drilling target is also in close proximity to the location o f very low frequency (VLF) earthquakes and the first tectonic tremo r recorded in any accretionary prism setting (summarized in Obar a and Kato, 2016), all of which suggest fault processes related to th e updip limit of megathrust seismogenic mechanics are active here. Recent results from the NanTroSEIZE long-term borehole monitoring systems and Dense Oceanfloor Network System for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET) seafloor observations furthe r suggest that the plate boundary at this location is partially locke d and partially releasing plate convergence strain in these slow sli p events accompanied by low-frequency tectonic tremor and VL F earthquakes (Araki et al., 2017).  

A detailed drilling plan was developed by the Center for Dee p Earth Exploration (CDEX) after careful analysis of the Expeditio n 338 and 348 drilling experiences (Figure F4). It involved sidetracking from near the bottom of the Hole C0002P casing pipe at 288 0 mbsf to begin Hole C0002Q and then advancing in three casin g stages, alternately drilling and then cementing in successive casin g strings to reach the zone just ${\sim}200\mathrm{~m~}$ above the anticipated plat e boundary fault zone. A comprehensive suite of LWD measurement s were planned, along with detailed cuttings analysis, to monito r progress and characterize the lower accretionary wedge/hangin g wall of the fault zone. The final stage of operations was planned t o drill across the high-amplitude seismic reflector identified as th e main plate boundary fault zone with LWD and then drill an ope n hole sidetrack for a second pass to core $100{-}200\,\mathrm{m}$ in total from th e hanging wall across the fault and into the footwall (Figure F4).  

For the ${\sim}2000\mathrm{~m~}$ interval of planned drilling above the targe t zone, the primary scientific objectives were to (1) determine th e composition, stratigraphy, and deformational history of the Miocene accretionary wedge; (2) reconstruct its thermal, diagenetic, and metamorphic history; (3) determine horizontal stress orientations and magnitudes; and (4) investigate the mechanical and hydrological properties of the upper plate of the seismogenic plat e boundary. In the target zone, a comprehensive structural, lithologic/petrologic, and physical properties characterization of th e fault zone and wall rocks was planned using cuttings, logging, an d continuous core sampling. The final objective was to leave the borehole in a condition that would allow for the design and deploymen t of a long-term in situ borehole observatory system subsequent t o the expedition.  

Previous major riser drilling efforts during Expeditions 338 an d 348  advanced  the  main  riser  hole  at  Site  C0002  (Hol e C0002F/C0002N/C0002P) to 3058.5 mbsf, and casing was installe d in that hole to 2922.5 mbsf (Figures F3, F4A). Extensive downhol e logging data, continuously sampled drill cuttings, and limited intervals of core were collected during those expeditions.  

# Principal results Site C0002  

Summary of planned Site C0002 riser operations for Expedition 358:  

• Employing the riser drilling technique, kick off from at or above the existing $11\%$ inch casing shoe at 2922.5 mbsf and open a new hole to ${\sim}5200$ mbsf or the maximum achievable depth within time and budget limits, setting $9\%$ inch (expanded to $11\%$ inch) casing, $9\%$ inch steel liner, and $7\%$ inch (expanded to $9\%$ inch) casing to ${\sim}4700$ mbsf and open hole drilling with an $8\%$ inch diameter bit below that to total depth (TD).   
• Use a suite of LWD/measurement-while-drilling tools and measurements to include gamma ray, sonic, and resistivity logs and   
images. Sample and analyze lithology, physical properties, and geochemistry of cuttings from the entire drilled interval at a suitable spacing (nominally every $5\;\mathrm{m}$ ).   
• At casing set points and other opportunities, conduct downhole tests—formation integrity test (FIT), extended leak-off tests (XLOTs), leak-off tests (LOTs), and other formation tests—to evaluate the in situ stress, pore fluid pressure, permeability, and rock strength conditions.   
• Core about 100 m: ${\sim}50\;\mathrm{m}$ from 4650 mbsf and ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{m}$ from 5150 mbsf or at a depth selected as we penetrate the fault zone.  

During the expedition, extensive difficulties establishing th e sidetracks and advancing the boreholes plagued the operation fro m the outset and continuously as a series of mitigation strategies wer e attempted (Figures F4C, F5). A more complete history of the operations appears below. In summary, riser drilling in Hole C0002Q advanced only to 3262.5 mbsf ( $204\,\mathrm{~m~}$ deeper than Hole C0002P ) before it had to be abandoned. Cuttings were obtained from thi s hole, but only a very basic LWD data set was acquired, includin g gamma ray and a resistivity log, rather than the full planned suit e that was to include resistivity imaging logs and sonic and check sho t seismic data. A second sidetrack was established at 2790 mbsf, an d Hole C0002R advanced to 3085 mbsf (Figure F5), again with onl y cuttings and basic logs acquired. Hole C0002S was sidetracked an d met a fate similar to that of Hole C0002R, ending at 2933 mbsf. Th e final sidetrack Hole C0002T was made, and three cores with minimal recovery were collected from 2836.5 to 2848.5 mbsf before rise r operations came to an end.  

Unfortunately, these technical setbacks resulted in only ver y modest scientific achievements at Site C0002. New cores were obtained ${\sim}600\;\mathrm{m}$ deeper than any previous cores from Expedition 34 8 and before. Cuttings and limited logs were obtained from ${\sim}204\,\mathrm{m}$ o f new drilling depth but came $2000\;\mathrm{m}$ short of the target. No downhole measurements related to in situ stress conditions were obtained.  

Scientific results from cuttings, logs, mud gas monitoring, an d cores of sidetrack Holes C0002Q–C0002T are reported in this section (Figure F6).  

# Lithology  

We analyzed cuttings from four overlapping holes (Hole s C0002Q–C0002T) and three cores from Hole C0002T. The combined depth interval for those samples extends from 2812.5 t o 3257.5 mbsf. We found four rock types with gradational lithologi c attributes. Fine silty claystone is light gray to gray in color. Its poorl y consolidated cuttings are typically rounded and sticky. Silty claystone is gray to olive black and more lithified, and its cuttings ar e angular and fissile. Siltstone shows a higher degree of consolidation, and its cuttings are angular. There are two varieties of sandstone: (1) gray, very fine grained, and angular and (2) light gray, fin e grained, less consolidated, and more rounded. Silty claystone is th e dominant lithology in Holes C0002Q–C0002T, composing $35\%-$ $80\%$ of the total cuttings (Figure F6). All other lithologies are subordinate, and fine silty claystone decreases to minor amounts. Collectively, all sedimentary rocks correlate with Lithologic Unit V a s defined during Expedition 348 (Tobin et al., 2015b).  

$\mathrm{\DeltaX}$ -ray diffraction (XRD) shows that clay minerals (smectite $^+$ illite $^+$ chlorite $^+$ kaolinite) are the most abundant mineral constituent, with normalized percentages of ${\sim}40{-}55~\mathrm{\wt\%}$ (Figure F6) . Proportions change somewhat with grain size; values for quartz an d feldspar are about $5{-}10~\mathrm{wt}\%$ larger in handpicked sandstone an d siltstone samples, and abundances of total clay minerals in coarse r lithologies are smaller by about $10{-}20\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . Calcite is usually belo w the detection limit by XRD $(<\!1\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ . When compared to bulk cuttings at corresponding depths from Hole C0002P, we notice a systematic shift toward modestly higher proportions of quartz an d feldspar. Those variations in bulk mineralogy are probably a reflection of natural heterogeneity in a steeply dipping succession o f interbedded silty claystone, siltstone, and fine sandstone. Overall, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) results exhibit no significant depth-dependent trends in bulk sediment geochemistry except for a sligh t increase in $\mathrm{MgO}$ with depth. The chemical uniformity within an d among the individual holes is consistent with relatively homogeneous proportions of rock types.  

The depth interval assigned to Lithologic Subunit VB in Hol e C0002P is characterized by abundant fine silty claystone and rar e sandstone (Tobin et al., 2015b). The facies was interpreted to be  a hemipelagic depositional environment punctuated by sporadic finegrained turbidity currents (Tobin et al., 2015b). The same depth interval in Holes C0002Q–C0002T appears to contain more fin e sandstone and siltstone. These deposits are likewise consistent wit h mostly hemipelagic deposition but contain modestly higher occurrences of silt and fine-sand turbidity currents. The environment o f deposition is therefore likely to have been a trench or an abyssal plain seaward of the trench.  

# Structural geology  

Very few identified deformation-related features ( $1\%$ of tota l cuttings exhibit them) occur between 2827.5 and 3257.5 mbsf. Granular and dogtooth calcite veins occur throughout the interval; slickenlines and stepped striae are rare. No scaly fabrics, mino r faults, or cataclastic bands were recovered in cuttings from Hole s C0002Q–C0002T. The low abundance of deformation structure s suggests that the sections of Holes C0002Q–C0002T betwee n 2827.5 and 3262.5 mbsf are weakly deformed.  

Mineral veins record different modes and phases of vein formation; crack-seal veins document repeated episodes of extensiona l fracturing potentially driven by fluctuations in pore fluid pressur e or prevailing stress state. Extensional fracturing can be followed b y shear deformation as recorded by shear veins and/or slickenline s partially overprinting crack-seal veins and vice versa.  

# Geochemistry  

At Site C0002, mud gas was analyzed from Holes C0002Q– $\mathrm{C0002T}$ and compared to earlier drilling in Hole C0002P during Expedition 348 (Tobin et al., 2015b). In addition, cuttings and core s were analyzed for headspace gas content and $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ total organi c carbon, and total nitrogen. Mud gas composition reveals trend s similar to the shallower riser drilling during Expedition 348, wit h decreasing $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ and $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratios downhole, whereas the $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C-CH_{4}}$ values remain largely between about $-50\%_{00}$ and about $-40\%_{00}$ , characteristic of thermogenic gas. Spikes toward higher methane concentrations seen at ${\sim}2950$ , ${\sim}3050$ , and ${\sim}3200$ mbsf are accompanie d by elevated $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $^{222}\mathrm{{Rn}}$ in the mud gas. In contrast, no such elevated concentrations were found in these depth intervals when analyzing the cuttings. All hydrocarbons as well as CO decrease wit h depth, and $_n$ -butane and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ are particularly low from ${\sim}3050$ mbs f downhole. We suspect that the spikes in real-time mud gas monitoring reflect fluid migration in minor fault zones that would likel y not be evident when analyzing cuttings.  

# Biostratigraphy and paleomagnetism  

Preliminary age determination for cuttings from Holes C0002Q– C0002T is based exclusively on the examination of calcareou s nannofossils. The abundance and preservation of calcareous nannofossils varies throughout the sequence. Different states of abundanc e and preservation are recognized even in different pieces from th e same cuttings sample. Nannofossil assemblages from the four hole s all contain Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus with a diameter greate r than or equal to $7\;\upmu\mathrm{m},$ except for a single piece from Slide C of Sample 358-C0002Q-365-SMW (3027.5 mbsf). R. pseudoumbilicus $^{\geq7}$ $\upmu\mathrm{m})$ has an age range of 12.8–3.63 Ma with an interval of absenc e between 8.8 and $7.09\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Assemblages recovered from 2917.5 t o 3257.5 mbsf (Hole C0002Q), from 2817.5 to 3077.5 mbsf (Hol e C0002R), and from 2847.5 to 2933.5 mbsf (Hole C0002S) can be assigned either to 12.8–8.8 or 7.09–3.63 Ma. An assemblage from Slid e C of Sample 365-SMW (3027.5 mbsf) that lacks R. pseudoumbilicus $({\geq}7~\upmu\mathrm{m})$ is indicative of an age between 8.8 and $7.09\,M{\bf a}$ .  

Radiolarians  and  foraminifers  were  also  found  in  Hole s C0002Q–C0002S but were not used for age determination becaus e of very rare occurrences. All radiolarians are possibly of reworke d origin.  

Remanent magnetizations of archive-half sections from Hol e C0002T were measured but did not yield useful results regardin g magnetic polarity because of poor core quality and recovery.  

# Physical properties  

In Holes C0002Q–C0002T, physical properties measurement s were conducted mostly on cuttings samples augmented by a fe w core samples from Hole C0002T. Moisture and density (MAD) measurements show that porosity of handpicked intact cuttings decreases from about $19\%$ at 2800 mbsf to about $17\%$ at 3250 mbs f (Figure F6A), which is in good agreement with the trend found fo r Hole C0002P during Expedition 348. The porosity for bulk cutting s from Hole C0002Q was $10\%{-}20\%$ higher than that of intact cutting s at depths overlapping Hole C0002P, which is again consistent wit h results from Hole C0002P, but the difference became smaller, o r nonexistent, toward the deeper section of Hole C0002Q and in th e remaining Holes C0002R–C0002T. The thermal conductivity measured on a core sample from Hole C0002T follows the trend suggested from previous expeditions.  

# Logging  

In Hole C0002Q (logging interva $=2888–3262\,\mathrm{mbsf}$ ), phase resistivity remains almost uniform over most of the logged interval and ranges between 2 and $3\;\Omega\mathrm{m}$ (Figure F6). Gamma ray is slightl y more variable, suggesting a mostly uniform lithology, with short excursions to lower values that could indicate fine sandy intervals o r other minor lithologies. These logging responses fit the characteristics of Logging Subunit Ve identified in the deeper section of Hol e C0002P (Tobin et al., 2015b), suggesting that the entire logged interval belongs to the same subunit.  

In Hole C0002Q at 2907–2916 mbsf, borehole failures are observed in a northwest–southeast orientation. The southeastern conductive zone has a larger width $(\sim\!93^{\circ})$ than the northwestern zon e $(\sim\!61^{\circ})$ . Because the southeast and northwest azimuths are approximately equivalent to the upper and lower sides of the deviated borehole, respectively, the wider low resistivity zone in the southeas t orientation, or at the top of the hole, indicates that the tool was separated from the upper side of the borehole. In contrast, the narrower low resistivity zone on the northwest, or bottom, side of th e hole indicates that the tool was largely in contact with the botto m side of the borehole. Therefore, the narrower low resistivity zone i n the northwest is considered to reflect the actual width of the borehole failure. The average width of the northwest borehole failure i s $61^{\circ}$ , and the maximum value is $86^{\circ}$ .  

# Site C0024  

With 28 days remaining in the expedition after the terminatio n of riser operations at Site C0002, drilling was conducted at two alternate contingency sites. Site C0024 is located a few kilometer s landward (northwest) of IODP Site C0006 in the frontal anticlin e overlying the frontal thrust (Figure F7). It targeted the hanging wall geology and the main frontal thrust at ${\sim}820$ mbsf. An LWD hol e was drilled into and penetrated the frontal thrust, which is interpreted to be a complex zone of fault strands and imbrication o f thrust slices. Coring was attempted in the zone below 500 mbsf, a s well as in several shallower intervals, but had to be abandoned because of deteriorating borehole conditions before reaching the mai n fault zone as identified in log and seismic data. Results from all holes at Site C0024 are summarized in this section (Figure F8).  

# Lithology  

The stratigraphic section at Site C0024 is divided into four lithologic units (Figure F8A). Lithologic Unit I is composed of silty cla y to clayey silt. We set the base of Unit I at the top of the uppermos t turbidite in Hole C0024B at 3.76 mbsf. No age-diagnostic nannofossils were identified in this interval, so the Holocene age is onl y inferred. The base of Unit I is a prominent unconformity.  

Most of Lithologic Unit II is 1.59–1.67 Ma in age and compose d of four lithologies in a continuum of gradational attributes: silty cla y to clayey silt, fine to coarse silt, sandy silt to silty sand, and very fin e to coarse sand. Scattered beds of volcanic ash are also present. Th e sand- and silt-rich beds typically display normal size grading, an d most such beds are thin $(<\!5\;\mathrm{cm})$ . We recorded 1112 event beds, including 30 layers of volcanic ash and 1081 inferred turbidites.  A coarsening-upward trend is evident from ${\sim}320$ to 230 mbsf, and  a prominent cluster of thick to very thick beds occurs between ${\sim}270$ and 230 mbsf. The trend fines upward from $\mathord{\sim}230$ to 58 mbsf an d coarsens upward from ${\sim}40$ mbsf to the seafloor. The overall facie s character is consistent with a trench-wedge environment punctuated by frequent influxes by turbidity currents. Most of the accretionary prism at Site C0024 is represented by Lithologic Unit II.  

The boundary between Lithologic Units II and III appears to b e conformable and is defined by a paucity of sand beds below. Nannofossils dated as 2.06–2.45 Ma reveal no contrast in age across th e unit boundary. The dominant lithology in Unit III is silty clayston e to clayey siltstone. Minor lithologies include very fine sandstone, siltstone, and volcanic ash or tuff. The mud deposits originate d from sustained hemipelagic settling in an outer trench-wedge setting. Silt beds were deposited from entrained layers of turbidity currents that lapped onto or spilled over the seaward slope of th e trench.  

The boundary between Lithologic Units III and IV appears to b e conformable and is defined by the last occurrence (moving downsection) of trench-related silty turbidites. Nannofossils reveal n o change in age $(2.06{-}2.45\,\mathrm{Ma})$ across the unit boundary. The boundary’s position at 555 mbsf matches the top of an anomalous trend i n porosity values and the top of a well-defined trend in XRD mineralogy, below which total clay minerals increase with depth (Figur e F8A). The dominant lithology is bioturbated silty claystone t o clayey siltstone; we also recovered six thin beds of light gray poorl y lithified tuff. Sedimentation was dominated by slow hemipelagi c settling in an environment that was isolated from sediment gravit y flows. These environmental conditions are commonplace across th e Shikoku Basin.  

# Structural geology  

Bedding dips vary $0^{\circ}{-30^{\circ}}$ (38–316 and 510–618.9 mbsf) and ar e slightly steeper in the shallowest part $(\mathrm{\sim}10^{\circ}{-}37^{\circ}$ at 0–38 mbsf). Steep minor normal faults dipping toward the southwest and northeast are common at $0{-}38~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , whereas the dip direction shifts toward the northwest and southeast below $100\ \mathrm{mbsf}.$ Deformatio n bands are generally dipping to the northwest or southeast, an d healed faults and sediment-filled vein structures are commonly observed at 510–618.9 mbsf. A brecciated zone and a shear zone potentially corresponding to a back thrust that was imaged in th e seismic reflection sections (Figure F7) were recovered at 243.5–24 7 and 295 mbsf, respectively.  

# Geochemistry  

At Site C0024, the chlorinity profile displays two different trend s separated by the gap in coring (Figure F8A). In the upper ${300}\,\mathrm{m},$ , th e trend in interstitial water (IW) is from a chlorinity value similar t o bottom water to one that is $2.5\%$ less fresh at the base of this profil e segment. This behavior almost certainly reflects alteration to cla y minerals of reactive volcanic matter disseminated in the sediment. Below the coring gap, the trend is reversed so that a $4\%$ freshenin g occurs over a narrower depth interval from 500 to 620 mbsf. Th e lower chlorinity profile segment suggests connection at depth wit h a source of lower chloride water. Another tracer of the deep fluid i s the ratio of methane to higher hydrocarbons, the $\mathsf C_{1}/(\mathsf C_{2}+\mathsf C_{3})$ ratio. This ratio decreases with depth driven in part by an increase i n higher hydrocarbons (Figure F8A). Coupled together, these tracer s suggest a fluid reservoir at depth sourced from a deeper portion o f the prism where clay mineral diagenesis releases freshened water s and thermogenic hydrocarbons are beginning to form. Unfortunately, samples from the décollement and below were not availabl e to characterize the deeper fluids.  

# Physical properties  

At Site C0024, physical properties measurements were conducted on core samples collected from 0 to 317.93 mbsf, 510 t o 618.13 mbsf, and 652.04 mbsf. MAD measurements on discret e core samples show porosity decreases from about $55\%{-}75\%$ close t o the seafloor to about $35\%$ at 550 mbsf. A sharp increase in porosit y to $45\%{-}50\%$ at 550–577 mbsf corresponds to the boundary betwee n Lithologic Units III and IV, marking the transition into the Shikok u Basin sediments underneath. A decrease in magnetic susceptibilit y from $5\times10^{-3}$ to $1.5\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{SI}$ measured by the multisensor core logger (MSCL) is also observed around this lithologic boundary, whic h is consistent with the trend observed at Site C0006 upon enterin g the upper Shikoku Basin sediments. $P.$ -wave velocity and electrica l resistivity measured on discrete samples also show a gradual decrease in velocity and resistivity around the unit boundary, which i s consistent with the increase in porosity at the unit boundary. Measured thermal conductivity values generally agree with those measured at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Sites C0006 and C0011.  

# Logging  

Logging data for Site C0024 were acquired in Hole C0024A wit h a full bottom-hole assembly (BHA) (MicroScope, arcVISION, TeleScope, SonicScope, and seismicVISION) in the interval from seafloor to a depth of 869 mbsf (Figure F8B). Good data quality fo r most of the logged interval allows definition of three logging unit s with distinct characteristics. Resistivity, gamma ray, and $P$ -wave velocity increase with depth in Logging Unit 1 $\mathrm{0{-}538.6~m b s f)}$ ), an d then resistivity and $P$ -wave velocity show constant trends with som e significant negative spikes in Logging Unit 2 (538.6–851.7 mbsf). Logging Unit 3 (851.7 mbsf to TD) is characterized by a significan t decrease in resistivity. Both button and propagation resistivity sho w a large separation of shallow and deep resistivities over this unit, which may be affected by poor borehole conditions.  

Bedding planes and fractures can be identified on resistivity images. Bedding dips mainly toward the northwest–northeast with di p angles of ${\sim}20^{\circ}$ above 809 mbsf. Below 809 mbsf to TD, the overall bedding dips sharply increase with a mean value around $40^{\circ}$ and  a maximum close to $90^{\circ}$ at 851 mbsf. Fractures exhibit various dip angles over the logged interval either to the north-northeast or th e north-northwest. At 813 mbsf, a pair of faults dipping $15^{\circ}$ and $20^{\circ}$ toward the north coincide with a further drop in gamma ray, resistivity, and $P$ -wave velocity values (Figure F9). In addition to th e above log response and image observation, a synthetic seismogra m using $P$ -wave velocity and vertical seismic profile data indicates tha t the decrease in $P$ -wave velocity values at ${\sim}806$ to ${\sim}813$ mbsf likel y corresponds to the interpreted fault reflection in the seismic reflection volume. Our preliminary interpretation is that the onset of deformation at ${\sim}806{-}813$ mbsf marks the top of the plate boundar y fault zone. Borehole breakouts were also identified on the resistivit y images throughout the hole. The orientation of the breakouts i s generally consistent at $070^{\circ}$ . Below ${\sim}600~\mathrm{mbsf}_{2}$ , we observed a sligh t shift in breakout orientation to lower azimuths. The shift in orientation is also observed below 810 mbsf, which is $15^{\circ}{-}20^{\circ}$ rotation t o an azimuth of $\mathrm{\sim}100^{\circ}$ .  

# Site C0025  

Site C0025, the second riserless contingency site drilled durin g Expedition 358, was chosen to address questions about the timin g of development of the Kumano fore-arc basin and the tectonic history of the inner accretionary wedge. The site is located where th e fore-arc basin sediments are underlain by a more deformed doma l or antiformal (based on seismic reflection interpretation; Figur e F10) formation that is alternatively hypothesized to represent eithe r (1) early inner wedge thrust sheet material or (2) diapiric mud risin g buoyantly into place. Rotary core barrel (RCB) drilling was carrie d out after first washing down to 400 mbsf where coring commenced, with the objective of dating and characterizing the lower fore-ar c basin and upper underlying wedge to discriminate between thes e hypotheses and elucidate the basin’s tectonic history. Nineteen RC B cores were collected to a TD of 580.5 mbsf, and results from this sit e are summarized in this section (Figure F11).  

# Lithology  

We documented the lithologic character of 18 cores from Hol e C0025A and defined two lithologic units starting at 400 mbsf. Th e dominant lithology in Lithologic Unit I is mottled silty claystone t o clayey siltstone, which we interpret to be hemipelagic mud. Thi n interbeds (interpreted to be turbidites) are composed of medium t o fine sandstone, silty sandstone, sandy siltstone, and siltstone. Th e base of Unit I at 441.93 mbsf coincides with the deepest inferre d turbidite. The age range of nannofossil assemblages from Unit I i s consistent with early Pleistocene deposition. The deposition of Uni t I occurred during the initial stages of infilling of the Kumano forearc basin.  

Bioturbated silty claystone and clayey siltstone are also commo n in Lithologic Unit II but are distinguished by a diverse host of secondary attributes: scattered dark green clay-rich bands; concentrations of organic matter and pyrite; foraminifers, worm tubes, sponge spicules, and Chondrites–Zoophycos trace fossils; fine san d laminae; and pumice clasts, thin volcanic ash beds, and irregular as h pods. Glauconite is distinctive as dispersed grains and in concentrated clusters. CaO (from XRF analysis) and calcite (from XRD ) values increase significantly in Unit II because of higher proportions of calcareous nannofossils (Figure F11). Nannofossils fro m Unit II span an age range of late Miocene to early Pleistocene (1.34– $4.13\;\mathrm{Ma})$ , and deposition probably occurred in a trench-slope environment with slow sediment accumulation rates. Unusual interval s in Cores 358-C0025A-7R, 16R, and 17R are composed of roughl y equal mixtures of fine sand-, silt-, and clay-sized particles (sand y mudstone to muddy sandstone). Most such examples are unstratified, heavily fragmented, or in extreme cases, reduced to slurry.  A provisional subunit boundary at 543.70 mbsf coincides with the to p of one such interval.  

# Structural geology  

The structural characteristics at Site C0025 are subhorizonta l bedding planes, incohesive normal faults and cohesive (healed ) faults, and sediment-filled vein structures. Inclined thick ( ${>}1\ \mathrm{mm}$ ; sometimes ${>}10~\mathrm{cm}$ ) healed faults characterized by weak clay mineral orientation and densification are observed in the lower par t (Cores 358-C0025A-18R through 19R; 561.5–580.5 mbsf) (Figur e F12). Unique sediment-filled vein structures with arrays oriente d parallel to and sometimes continuous with the thick faults are coexisting.  

# Geochemistry  

An important characteristic of the IW at Site C0025 is freshening by $18\%{-}35\%$ as observed in the salinity and chlorinity profile s (Figure F11). The minimum chlorinity value is centered at 450. 3 mbsf, which coincides with the depth of the bottom-simulating reflector (BSR) inferred to represent the base of the gas hydrate stability zone, but low chlorinity extends to at least 572 mbsf. Mos t dissolved ions at Site C0025 do not greatly vary in concentratio n with depth. An important exception is boron. Boron concentration s show a broad maximum from 450.3 to 489.2 mbsf with values 2. 5 times seawater. High boron coupled with freshened waters is a common signature of mud diapirs located along tectonic strike to th e northeast (Kopf et al., 2003). Planned shore-based boron isotop e studies may distinguish between processes related to hydrate dissociation or fluid flux from depth causing the observed chemical anomalies.  

# Physical properties  

At Site C0025, physical properties measurements were conducted on core samples collected from 400 to 574.34 mbsf. MA D measurements on discrete core samples show an overall constan t porosity trend scattering between $38.5\%$ and $54.5\%$ (Figure F11). Intervals with sandier formations show relatively lower porosity between $40\%$ and $43\%$ , and the occurrence at 544 mbsf coincides wit h the boundary between Lithologic Subunits IIA and IIB. Althoug h penetrometer measurements indicate a marked increase in induration at about 465 mbsf, only a slight decrease in porosity $(\sim\!3\%)$ occurs around this depth. However, a pronounced spike in natural gamma ray count measured by MSCL occurs at this depth becaus e of the presence of glauconite-bearing clasts found in the core. Also, the vertical anisotropy in electrical resistivity (positive when mor e resistive in the horizontal direction) changes from overall positiv e to negative at this depth $(465~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ). Magnetic susceptibility decreases rapidly from $4\,\times\,10^{-4}$ to $1\,\times\,10^{-4}$ SI between 442 and 45 0 mbsf, which corresponds to the boundary between Lithologic Unit s I and II. Measured thermal conductivity values are negatively correlated with porosity and generally agree with those measured o n the Kumano Basin sediments at Site C0002 (Expedition 315 Scientists, 2009; Strasser et al., 2014).  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 358 had extraordinarily ambitious scientific goals , representing many firsts in scientific ocean drilling: the first sampling and in situ measurements in a plate boundary fault zone a t seismogenic depths of more than $4\,\mathrm{km}$ to investigate and documen t the geology, physical and geochemical properties, and stress conditions of a plate boundary fault zone. Operationally, this require d drilling ${\sim}2200\mathrm{~m~}$ of new depth in an existing cased hole that ha d already reached ${\sim}2900$ mbsf, installing and cementing casing alon g the way, and collecting a suite of LWD logs, cuttings, downhol e pressure tests, and $100{-}200\,\mathrm{m}$ of core at selected intervals. Preparation for the potential challenges of geological and stress or flui d pressure conditions in the planned borehole was intense, with several years of planning including the drill well on paper (DWOP) exercise, the implementation of a real-time geomechanics (RTG ) team, and external consulting on the mud program and other parameters.  

Unfortunately, we were unable to even begin to address the primary scientific objectives because of the operational difficulties encountered continuously throughout the first 4 months of rise r drilling. The maximum depth achieved of 3262.5 mbsf is a new record depth for scientific ocean drilling, yet it represents only $10\%$ o f the planned advance. Even that $10\%$ is only a partial achievement, a s only cuttings and very basic logs (gamma ray and resistivity curves ) were acquired to this depth. No LOTs or other downhole measurements relevant to stress and pore fluid pressure were conducted because they were planned for locations just below installed an d cemented casing shoes, which were not installed. Hole C0002 T cores, similarly, are the deepest ever collected, which is an operational achievement; however, they were not taken from a prioritize d target zone and yielded little to no new scientific insight. Becaus e Site C0002 riser drilling was the only primary plan for the expedition, the near-complete lack of success in achieving any scientifi c objectives was a striking disappointment.  

Alternative contingency Sites C0024 and C0025 had specific scientific goals that were met with at least partial success. At Sit e C0024, the objective was to log and sample the frontal décollemen t zone (shallow plate boundary). The dedicated logging hole appear s to have intersected at least the upper fault boundary and image d and logged as much as $40\;\mathrm{{m}}$ of fault zone. It is not clear whether th e base was reached or not. These logs add to a growing global data se t of physical properties in active plate boundary fault systems. Th e high-resolution resistivity image log enabled analyses of borehol e breakouts and orientations of planar structures in the plate boundary fault zone and overlying frontal prism. Coring efforts in Hole s C0024E and C0024F to reach this zone failed, unfortunately, because of hole stability issues. However, sediments recording th e transition between Shikoku Basin and trench fill sediments wer e successfully recovered from Hole C0024E. Shallow sediments wer e recovered in cores from Holes C0024B–C0024D and C0024G. Th e tectonic evolution of the frontal thrust system and strain partitioning between the frontal thrust and splay fault will be elucidated b y stratigraphic analysis of these cores and logs, together with the results from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Sites C0006 an d C0007.  

At Site C0025, the principal scientific objectives were to obtai n age control on the onset of Kumano fore-arc basin filling and th e nature of the deformed zone beneath it, testing alternative hypotheses of its formation through tectonic thrust faulting processes o r mud diapirism. Coring from 400 to 571 mbsf yielded datable material and possible evidence for diapiric intrusion of sediments. Geochemical and other evidence suggests that older accreted materia l was not reached in the drilled interval.  

In summary, this expedition enjoyed modest successes, mostl y during the riserless contingency operations, but unfortunately di d not achieve essentially any of the scientific objectives of the primar y deep riser drilling plan or really get into position to tackle those objectives. This was not a result of unanticipated geological condition s such as mistaken interpretation or encountering a highly challenging drilling target; rather, the scientific hypotheses were not teste d because the primary zone of interest was never reached for operational and engineering reasons.  

# Operations summary  

# Operational preparation for riser drilling  

Site C0002 was the first IODP drill site where an industry-styl e DWOP review was held prior to the beginning of drilling. The normal complications of riser drilling are compounded by the accretionary prism setting, and all parties involved in the expedition, including all third-party contractors, participated in this exercise. Expedition 358 was also the first IODP expedition where an RT G team was developed to advise the drilling team with updated evaluations of the geomechanical model. Unfortunately, drilling did no t progress to a point where their expertise could be fully brought t o bear on drilling evaluation.  

# Transit from Shimizu, Japan  

Expedition 358 began on 7 October 2018 in the port of Shimizu , Japan, and the D/V Chikyu left on 10 October en route for Sit e C0002. Chikyu paused 2.5 days (Table T1) at the entrance of Surug a Bay to test the small-diameter RCB (SD-RCB) and RCB assembly. After completion, Chikyu continued on to Site C0002, arriving o n 13 October.  

# Site C0002  

Upon return to Site C0002 (Figure F1), the ship was set in dynamic positioning mode and the remotely operated vehicle (ROV ) dove for a seabed survey and transponder deployment. Blowou t preventer (BOP) running began at $2400~\mathrm{h}$ (Japan Standard Tim e [JST]) on 14 October 2018. Troubleshooting found problems wit h the pressure switches, so the BOP was recovered to the surface fo r troubleshooting and repairs. After all the pressure switches in th e blue pod were replaced, BOP running began again on 19 October. The BOP landed on the wellhead on 23 October without any mor e issues, and BOP pressure and function tests were completed by 2 5 October.  

Two drill out cement (DOC) BHAs $12\%$ and $10\%$ inch) (Tabl e T2) were made up and run in the hole on 29 October and bega n drilling out the cement plug on 30 October. The $11\%$ inch liner an d $13\%$ inch casing pressure test was good. Three shoe bond tests wer e run before the DOC BHA was pulled out of the hole for a scrape r run. On 3 November, the wireline cement bond log tool was mad e up and run, logging between 2125 and $4878\mathrm{~m~}$ below rotary tabl e (BRT) to check the condition of the casing-cement-formation bonding.  

After rigging down the wireline tools on 4 November, preparations to run and set the whipstock assembly began with the eas y drill sliding sleeve valve (EZSV) setting the plug setting tool. Th e EZSV was set at $4869\,\mathrm{m}$ BRT, and the $11\%$ inch whipstock assembl y was made up from 5 November and run to tag the top of the EZSV. The gyro assembly was run to ensure that the whipstock was facin g the proper azimuth (N90E) to avoid intersecting Hole C0002P. However, the whipstock failed to set, so it was recovered, and a ne w whipstock assembly was made up and run in the hole on 8 November. The orientation surveys azimuth confirmed the whipstock orientation was between $88.2^{\circ}$ and $86.5^{\circ}$ , and the whipstock set by  9 November.  

Milling to $4862\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT was finished by 10 November but wa s run in the hole again to complete milling to $4867~\mathrm{m}$ BRT and dres s the window. A FIT at the window on 12 November was good (equivalent mud weight $=1.450$ specific gravity [SG]), so the second FI T was canceled. A $10\%$ inch window mill assembly was run in the hol e from 13 November but had trouble passing through the window; i t was pulled out of the hole for grinding to reduce the outside diameter. The milling assembly was run in the hole and worked to $4864\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT by $2400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 November.  

Drilling in Holes C0002Q–C0002T was extremely complicated , with multiple tracks in each hole (Figure F4), because it was difficul t to keep the BHAs in the same kick-off holes (“runs”) outside th e windows in the Hole C0002P casing. Details on bits and tools fo r each LWD run are in Table T2.  

# Hole C0002Q  

Hole C0002Q began early on 18 November 2018 when the kickoff BHA began drilling from $4867\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT (Table T1). Hole C0002 Q reached $4990\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT by 20 November and was pulled out of th e hole to the surface by 21 November (Hole C0002Q Track 1 in Figur e F4). After servicing the hydraulic power swivel (HPS) and travelin g block, the $8\%$ inch $\times\ 12\%$ inch LWD BHA with a Z-Reamer wa s made up and run in the hole. The LWD BHA reached the windo w and began reaming down from 4888 to $4909\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT; however, getting the BHA through the window proved difficult, so it was pulle d out of the hole to run a hole-opening BHA from 25 November.  

The hole-opening assembly, including arcVISION and TeleScope, was made up and run in the hole to $4778\,\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT. Befor e passing through the $4800\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT window, the BHA was pulled up t o $4047\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT for a Z-Reamer function test when it was confirme d that the reamer ball seat had sheared. The BHA was pulled out o f the hole to replace the Z-Reamer, and the replacement hole-opening assembly was made up and run in the hole, reaching $4845\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT by 28 November. LWD function tests confirmed all tools wer e working well, so washing/reaming down began. On 29 November a t $4941\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT, the BHA packed off but was soon released, reaming t o $4955\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT before pulling up to $4894\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT to activate the ZReamer. By 3 December, $4995\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT was reached with the averag e rate of penetration (ROP) never exceeding $3.3\;\mathrm{m/h}$ . By 7 December, $5230\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT was reached (Hole C0002Q Track 2 in Figure F4). Th e extremely low ROP was a concern, so the BHA was pulled and lai d out by 9 December. A new LWD BHA, including an underreamer, was run in the hole and began drilling at $1345\,\mathrm{h}$ . The underreame r was activated when the reamer was at $4916\,\mathrm{m}$ BRT on 12 December, and the hole opened to $4928\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT (Hole C0002Q Track 3 in Figure F4). Poor progress and hole conditions continued, so the BH A was pulled out of the hole and laid down on 14 December to inspec t the  Z-Reamer  underreamer.  The  underreamer  was  damage d (chipped blades, etc.), so a new kick off was planned to escape fro m the poor hole conditions in Hole C0002Q.  

# Hole C0002R  

Preparations to run in the hole with a new whipstock began o n 15 December 2018 (Table T1). After successfully conducting a casing pressure test, the new whipstock was run in the hole on 16 December and set at $4766\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT on 17 December. Milling out wa s completed by 20 December, with multiple milling BHAs and reciprocation through the window to ensure that the hole was clean. Th e new window cut from Hole C0002P was located at $4757{-}4763\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT (Figure F4). A FIT (1.46 SG) was conducted in the new window, and the milling BHA was pulled out of the hole and laid dow n on 20 December. Another window dressing BHA was run in th e hole and reamed down to $4767\,\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT. The dressing BHA wa s pulled out of the hole in preparation for running the kick-off BHA. Drilling mud weight was increased from 1.37 to 1.39 SG on 24 December before drilling and sliding continued. $\mathrm{On}~25\$ December, drilling from $4811.5\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT began, reaching $4843\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT by 26 December. Although the kick-off BHA finally reached $4963\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT b y 29 December, the many issues with poor borehole conditions, multiple overpulls while drilling, low ROP, and repeating overpulls an d pressure spikes during reaming meant the BHA would be pulled ou t of the hole to the surface and laid out on 30 December. TeleScop e data were downloaded while a new kick-off BHA was made up an d run in the hole on 30 December.  

On 31 December, the new kick-off hole began from $4963\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT , reaching $5052\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT on 3 January 2019 (Hole C0002R Track 1 i n Figure F4). Reaming up and down commenced before returning th e BHA to the surface to examine the mud motor, which was showin g signs of failure. Once on deck, we found the top connection of th e motor was overtorqued onto the crossover sub, whereas the moto r itself had backed off, exposing the interior mechanism. A new LW D BHA was made up and run in the hole on 6 January. Washing an d reaming down from $4744\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT began on 7 January; the Z-Reame r was activated at $4834\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT (bit depth). Reaming out the borehol e and drilling a new hole from 8 January reached $4880~\mathrm{m}$ BRT (Hol e C0002R Track 2 in Figure F4). Hole cleaning and reaming were carried out until 9 January. The top drive torque started fluctuating an d showing other signs of poor hole conditions, so the BHA was pulle d out of the hole to the surface to avoid damaging the borehole. Examination showed that there was extensive damage to the bit an d the underreamer; cutters were severely damaged. A new LWD BH A with a new underreamer was made up and run in the hole on 1 0 January. Because many tight spots were found while reaming dow n to $4745\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT, on 11 January we decided to set the $9\%$ inch $\times11\%$ inch expandable casing (ESET) at this depth. The LWD BHA wa s pulled out of the hole to the surface by 12 January, and preparatio n for $9\%$ inch ESET installation was started. Running the ESET bega n on 13 January and reached $4818\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT by 14 January. Expandin g the ESET was conducted after cementing, and the ESET launche r assembly was pulled out of the hole to the surface by January 15. The launcher tool showed no signs of damage. A 9.851 inch DO C BHA was made up and run to $1403~\mathrm{m}$ BRT on 15 January. A pressure test of the $11\%$ inch liner and ESET was conducted by $2000~\mathrm{h}$ on 15 January and indicated that the casing was set and cemente d properly. The DOC BHA reached $4791\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT on 16 January an d started drilling out the ESET casing shoe. However, a drilling break, a sudden pressure increase (from 21.6 to $24.8\ \mathrm{MPa})$ ), and stall $_{>38}$ kN) were observed from 4815 to $4816\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT, resulting in a stuc k pipe at $1345\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 January. Working the pipe started immediatel y and continued until 18 January with no sign that the drill strin g could be freed. A free point indicator tool was run to find a back-of f point for the stuck BHA from 18 to 19 January. The back-off tool assembly was run and successfully backed off the drill pipe at $1730\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 January between the $6\%$ inch drill Collars 2 and 3 at $4793.75$ m BRT. A fishing BHA was run down onto Collar 2 and began working the pipe until 23 January, jarring more than 400 times. Anothe r attempt to collide the stuck drill string failed when the $58.5\:\mathrm{mm}\,\mathrm{OD}$ gauge cutter failed to pass the inside of the drill pipe even afte r modification. A blind back-off operation was conducted on 27 January, but the drill string was reconnected because the back-off poin t was too shallow. A colliding tool was run and severed the stuck drill string at $4782\textrm{m}$ BRT on 28 January. The collided drill pipe wa s pulled out of the hole and recovered to the surface on 29 January.  

# Hole C0002S  

A new kick off above the fish in Hole C0002R was begun on 3 0 January after rig repair. A whipstock and Tri-Mill assembly wer e made up and run in the hole on 31 January 2019 (Table T1). Th e whipstock was set at $4779\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT (above the fish) and oriented a t ${\sim}73^{\circ}$ on 1 February. Milling and dressing the casing was complete d on 3 February with the window opened at 4769–4775 m BRT (Figure F4). An $8\%$ inch kick-off BHA (bent angle 1.5°) was made up an d run in the hole on 3 February.  

Hole C0002S was reamed and drilled down to $4788.5\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT b y 3 February, and then the BHA was pulled out of the hole to $4766\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT. A gyro assembly was run ( $4115\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT; wireline [WL] depth ) to orient the BHA tool face to ${\sim}215^{\circ}$ on 4 February. After washin g and reaming down to $4788\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT, the BHA was recovered to th e surface on 5 February. A full suite $8\%$ inch LWD BHA was made u p (Table T1) and run in the hole to $4747\mathrm{~m}$ BRT. After several LW D tool communication tests, the LWD BHA was washed down t o $4780.5\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT. Drilling down from there began on 6 February an d reached $4900\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT by 8 February (Figure F4). Several stalls occurred (4798, 4801.5, 4803.3, and $4805\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT) while drilling. Drilling resumed after activating the rotary steerable system (RSS) t o reduce inclination on 8 February, but issues with miscommunication between the RSS and the lower C-Link and abnormal on/of f bottom torque and pressure were observed. The RSS LWD BH A was pulled out of the hole on 8 February. Upon recovery of the BH A to the surface on 9 February, the bottom part of the BHA, the CLink and RSS, were lost in the hole. Three fishing operations wer e attempted but failed. Another kick off to begin coring started wit h another kick-off cementing job at $4850\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT on 13 February (Figure F4). A new $8\%$ inch kick-off BHA was run and tagged the top o f cement at $4748\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT on 15 February and then started to drill ou t cement.  

# Hole C0002T  

A wireline gyro assembly was run to $4724\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT (WL depth) t o set the orientation of the kick-off BHA at ${\sim}211^{\circ}$ on 16 Februar y 2019. The kick-off BHA slid from 4784 to $4800\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT and the n drilled down to $4804\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT by 16 February. Fracseal $(10~\mathrm{m}^{3})$ wa s spotted at the hole bottom, and reaming between 4804 and $4790\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT was finished before the kick-off BHA was pulled out of the hol e to the surface on 17 February. A coring $8\%$ inch SD-RCB BHA wa s run to $4752\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT on 18 February and then washed/reamed dow n from 4752 to $4804\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT with the center bit. The center bit wa s recovered to the surface on 18 February, and then core cutting began from $4804\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT on 18 February. Three cores were cut an d retrieved from 4804 to $4816\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT by $0300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 February (Figure F4). However, stalling and pack offs occurred at $4816\mathrm{~m~}$ BR T while reaming down on 20 February. The poor hole conditions required abandoning the hole, and the BHA was pulled out of the hol e on 20 February and recovered to the surface on 21 February.  

Three attempts at spotting a cement spot plug finally succeede d at $4769\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT on 24 February. This cement plug passed a pressur e test on 25 February. A fourth plug back cementing job was set a t $3350\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT by $2330\,\mathrm{h}$ . The diverter assembly was pulled out of th e hole, and inhibited mud was spotted. A short pause for rig servicin g occurred before the wear bushing and wear bushing running/retrieving tools were recovered on the surface. The riser mud was displaced with seawater before operations to recover the riser, an d BOP commenced from 27 February. The riser was laid out, and th e BOP was recovered in the moonpool by 2 March.  

# Site C0024  

Site C0024 is located near the deformation front of the Nanka i accretionary prism off the Kii Peninsula (Figures F1, F2, F7, F13). Understanding the function of the frontal décollement in coseismi c and interseismic periods is a specific target for the drilling site s around the deformation front.  

# Hole C0024A  

The LWD BHA was spudded in and washed down from 6 Marc h 2019 after a seafloor survey with the underwater TV (UWTV) camera. After recovering the UWTV, drilling began, pausing for survey s almost every stand. Nonstop driller connections per stand starte d from 8 March. After reaching $4738\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT on 9 March, worsenin g connections resulted in halting any advance. While pulling out o f the hole, the LWD BHA was stopped for periodic check shots fo r the seismicVISION tool, performing repeat logs from 4180 to 413 0 m BRT and from 3885 to $3867\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT. The BHA was laid out o n deck by 10 March.  

# Holes C0024B–C0024D  

After a waiting on weather break, the $10\%$ inch hydraulic pisto n coring system (HPCS)/extended punch coring system (EPCS)/extended shoe coring system (ESCS) BHA (Table T3) was made u p and run in the hole. Chikyu shifted $40\;\mathrm{m}$ to begin coring; a series o f overpull events required the drawworks assist to recover the inne r barrel, pulling the BHA above the seafloor. This resulted in Hole s C0024B–C0024D. In Hole C0024D, the formation was hard enoug h to confirm that the same hole was being reentered by the BHA. HPCS coring was replaced in succession by EPCS, ESCS, EPCS, an d finally ESCS coring. Coring continued until the inner barrel pull ba r broke on recovery, and on 13 March 2019, coring in this hole wa s abandoned.  

# Hole C0024E  

Hole C0024E was spudded in from $0315~\mathrm{h}$ on 15 March 201 9 with the $10\%$ inch RCB BHA (Table T3). Drilling ahead to $4382\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT was completed by 16 March when the center bit was recovere d and RCB coring began (see Table T4 for coring summary). Corin g continued for 13 cores until hole conditions reached a point wher e reaming failed to improve things. RCB coring was stopped, and th e BHA was pulled out of the hole to $111\;\mathrm{m}$ above the seafloor by th e morning of 18 March.  

# Hole C0024F  

The Hole C0024E RCB BHA was shifted over to spud in Hol e C0024F on the evening of 18 March 2019. Drilling ahead with th e center bit continued until reaching $4589.5\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT with few issues, but below that stand pipe pressure, HPS, overtorque, and overpull steadily worsened. The BHA was pulled out of the hole to $4553~\mathrm{m}$ BRT, and pumping to clear the hole began before pulling the cente r bit to start coring on 21 March. By evening the borehole had worsened, and the BHA was pulled out of the hole to the surface and lai d down. A “ghost core” was recovered from the core liner.  

# Hole C0024G  

The RCB BHA was switched to the ESCS BHA and spudded i n Hole C0024G on 22 March 2019. After drilling to $3971.5\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT, ESCS coring began, and the target depth was reached at $4191\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT on 25 March (Table T4). Transponders were recovered by th e watch boat so that the ship could begin shifting to Site C0025 b y $2100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 March.  

# Site C0025  

Upon completion of drilling operations at Site C0024, Chikyu moved to the northwest margin of the Kumano Basin to examin e the processes of the accretionary prism and fore-arc basin development.  

# Hole C0025A  

The RCB coring BHA was made up and spudded in Hol e C0025A on 25 March 2019 (Figure F14; Tables T5, T6). Washin g down and then drilling ahead with the center bit to $2439.5\mathrm{~m~}$ BR T was completed by 27 March. Coring operations continued here until the end of contingency time at $1100~\mathrm{h}$ on 29 March. Corin g reached $2620\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT, collecting 19 RCB cores (Table T7). The coring BHA was pulled out of the hole and laid down, cement was spotted in the hole, and Chikyu began the transit back to the port o f Shimizu, Japan, reaching the anchorage on the morning of 3 1 March.

Figure F12. (A) Photo image logger (MSCL-I) and (B) X-ray computed tomography (CT) images parallel to split core surface (358-C0025A-19R-3, $40{-}64.5\ \mathrm{cm})$ ) illustrating sediment-filled veins (green arrows), cohesive healed faults (purple arrows), and a normal fault (red arrows). On X-ray CT images, cohesive heale d faults are brighter than the surrounding matrix and correspond to higher X-ray CT number and density. The normal fault can be identified because it displace s array vein structures (X-ray CT images). Sediment-filled vein structures are generally resolved on X-ray CT images and occur as bright features filled with highe r density material. Thinner sediment-filled vein structures are not resolved (X-ray CT images).
