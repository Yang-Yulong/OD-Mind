During Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 339, five sites were drilled in the Gulf of Cádiz and two sites were drilled off the West Iberian margin from November 2011 to January 2012. Expedition 339 recovered $5447\mathrm{~m~}$ of core, with an average recovery of $86.4\%$ . The Gulf of Cádiz was targeted for drilling as a key location for the investigation of Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) through the Strait of Gibraltar (Gibraltar Gateway) and its influence on global circulation and climate. The gulf is also a prime area for understanding the effects of tectonic activity on evolution of the Gibraltar Gateway and margin sedimentation. Drilling penetrated into the Miocene at two sites in the Gulf of Cádiz and showed a MOW signal in the sedimentary record following the opening of the Gibraltar Gateway. The Pliocene succession, penetrated at four sites, displays characteristics consistent with low bottom-current activity and weak MOW since near the beginning of the Pliocene at ${\sim}4.5–4.2\ \mathrm{Ma}$ and a somewhat more pronounced contourite signal upward through the Pliocene. Significant widespread unconformities found at $3.0–3.2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ are interpreted as a signal of intensified MOW. The Quaternary succession was sampled at six sites and displays characteristics consistent with a much more pronounced phase of contourite drift development. There are three distinct periods of high MOW activity separated by two widespread unconformities at $2.2–2.4\ \mathrm{Ma}$ and $\mathord{\sim}0.9$ Ma related to even higher MOW. Following the ${\sim}0.9\mathrm{~Ma}$ unconformity, the final phase of drift evolution established the contourite depositional system architecture we see today.  

There is significant climatic and tectonic control on the evolution of MOW and bottom-current activity. Preliminary work has shown a remarkable record of orbital-scale variation in bulk sediment properties of contourites at several of the drift sites and good correlation between all sites. Climate control on contourite sedimentation is clearly significant at this scale; further work will determine the nature of controls at the millennial scale. However, from the closure of the Atlantic-Mediterranean gateways in Spain and Morocco around 6 Ma and the opening of the Gibraltar Gateway at $5.3\ \mathrm{Ma}$ to the present day, even stronger tectonic control has affected margin development, downslope sediment transport, and contourite drift evolution. Based on the timing of these events recorded in the sedimentary record, we propose that tectonic pulsing in the region, resulting from small movements of the Africa and Eurasia plates and associated deepseated asthenosphere activity, has played an important role in controlling sedimentation on this margin.  

The Gulf of Cádiz is the world’s premier contourite laboratory and thus presents an ideal testing ground for the contourite paradigm. Following recovery of more than $4.5\;\mathrm{km}$ of contourite cores from six of the sites under direct MOW influence, existing models for contourite deposition are found to be sound. Further study of these models will undoubtedly allow us to resolve outstanding issues of depositional processes, drift budgets, and recognition of fossil contourites in the ancient record onshore. The expedition also verified the presence of contourite sands that are clean and well sorted in a number of settings, including those created by local diapiric activity. These sands represent a completely new and important deepwater sand type that, where found deeper in the subsurface, could provide a significant exploration target for potential oil and gas reservoirs. At the deeper water site off southwest Portugal (the Shackleton site), we drilled five separate holes and recovered two complete splice sets of Quaternary hemipelagic sedimentation over the past $1.4\,\mathrm{~m.y.}$ . These will form the basis of detailed shore-based collaboration to establish a high-precision marine reference section of Quaternary climate change for comparison  with  other  marine  sections  and  with established ice-core and terrestrial records.  

# Introduction  

Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 339 combined IODP Proposal 644-Full2 and ancillary proposal letter (APL)-763. The expedition was primarily  paleoceanographic  in  nature,  focusing mainly on the broader significance of Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) on North Atlantic Ocean circulation and climate. This expedition offered a rare opportunity to understand the global link between paleoceanographic, climatic, and sea level changes from Messinian to recent time and addressed the importance of ocean gateways in regional and global ocean circulation and climate.  

Seven sites (U1385–U1391) were cored and, of those seven, five sites were logged during the expedition in the Gulf of Cádiz and on the West Iberian margin (Figs. F1, F2). Six of the sites, U1386–U1391, were specifically located in order to study the contourite depositional system (CDS) generated by MOW influence and its evolution and environmental implications (Proposal 644-Full2). This CDS has developed at very high rates of sediment accumulation over the past 5 m.y. as the direct result of MOW, providing an expanded sedimentary record that permits detailed examination of paleocirculation patterns linked to past environmental change. One of the sites, U1385, was positioned at the Shackleton site on the Portuguese margin to produce a marine reference section of  Pleistocene  millennial-scale  climate  variability and changes in surface and deepwater circulation (APL-763). Climate signals from this reference section will constrain the temporal relationships of abrupt climate change recorded in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, the polar ice cores, and European terrestrial records.  

The five principal objectives of Expedition 339 address key elements of the IODP Initial Science Plan (ISP) through targeted drilling of a Neogene and Quaternary continental margin sequence in the Gulf of Cádiz and off West Iberia.  

1. Oceanic gateways and their influence: tectonically induced changes are highlighted in the ISP as one of the principal internal forcing mechanisms for environmental change. By drilling in the Gulf of Cádiz, we seek to document the effects of opening the Gibraltar Gateway at ${\sim}5.3\ \mathrm{Ma}$ and therefore initiating the major influx of warm, saline intermediate  water  into  the  North  Atlantic Ocean.   
2. Paleocirculation and climate: one of the fundamental scientific questions identified in the ISP under Environmental Change, Processes, and Effects is “How did the Earth system respond to climatic change and at what timescales?” A key response of the ocean system to climate forcing is significant reorganization of global circulation and adjustment in the thermohaline conveyor belt model. Hence, the record of paleocirculation and paleoclimate is further identified as a specific target in the ISP. Expedition 339 research will address changes in and effects of MOW as a component of North Atlantic circulation in the postMiocene time period.   
3. Rapid climate change: rapid climate change is highlighted as a special initiative in the ISP under Environmental Change, Processes, and Effects. Future advances in our understanding of the causes of abrupt change will rely on our ability to correlate high-resolution sedimentary archives from oceans, ice cores, and terrestrial sequences  

and to interpret these records in the context of novel Earth system modeling approaches. A challenge for IODP, and for the broader drilling community, is to identify sequences from appropriate locations with adequate temporal resolution to study processes of the integrated climate system.  

Expedition 339 recovered sediment records deposited at high accumulation rates containing high-fidelity signals of Pleistocene climate variability and rapid climate change that can be correlated to polar ice-core and terrestrial archives.  

4. Sea level change and sediment architecture: the response of sediment architecture, especially along continental margins, to sea level change is highlighted in the ISP as the second principal internal forcing mechanism for environmental change. Whereas considerable attention and several past Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) drilling legs have been directed toward placing turbidites and other downslope systems within a sequence stratigraphic context, there is no generally accepted understanding of how and where the alongslope sedimentary system, driven by bottom water circulation, fits within these models. Fundamental questions regarding the timing and extent of hiatuses and condensed sequences and the corollary periods of alongslope deposition, drift development, and paleodepth reconstruction have yet to be answered. The objectives of Expedition 339 address precisely these aspects of sediment architecture within the Gulf of Cádiz and West Iberian marginal sequences in relation to changes in sea level and other forcing mechanisms.  

5. Neotectonic activity: margin evolution anywhere is controlled by complex interactions of many different forcing variables, most importantly sea level and climate, sediment supply, and tectonics. Results from Expedition 339 will be used to reconstruct the timing of neotectonic activity that had a significant impact on submarine topography and, consequently, controlled the flow path of the two branches of MOW and their influence in the North Atlantic.  

Expedition 339 was ambitious in scope and scientifically exciting. It was carefully crafted by a broad spectrum of scientists over at least 9 years gestation period. The expedition reflects intense international interest in the region and its global significance, building on a research database accumulated over 35 years. Furthermore, the study of the CDS should be of great interest to the international community not only because of its stratigraphic, sedimentologic, paleoceanographic,  and  paleoclimatologic  significance but also because of its close relationship with possible  specific  deep-marine  geohabitats  and/or mineral and energy resources (Rebesco and Camerlenghi, 2008; Hernández-Molina et al., 2011b).  

# Background  

# Geological and oceanographic setting Tectonic framework  

The southwestern margin of the Iberian Peninsula, at the eastern end of the Azores-Gibraltar zone, is the location of the plate boundary between Eurasia and Africa. The present plate convergence between the Africa and Eurasia plates in the Gulf of Cádiz area is ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{\mm/y}$ with a northwest–southeast trend and is accommodated over a broad, deformation zone (Olivet, 1996; Argus et al., 1989). Distinct periods of crustal deformation, fault reactivation, and halokinesis related to movement between Eurasia and Africa (Malod and Mauffret, 1990; Srivastava et al., 1990; Maldonado et al., 1999; Gutscher et al., 2002; Alves et al., 2003; Gutscher, 2004; Medialdea et al., 2004, 2009; Lopes et al., 2006; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009) are known to have controlled the tectonostratigraphic evolution of this part of the Iberian Peninsula. The tectonic structure of this area is a consequence of the distinct phases of rifting since the Late Triassic to the Early Cretaceous caused by the opening of the Central and North Atlantic Basin (Murillas et al., 1990; Pinheiro et al., 1996; Wilson et al., 1996; Srivastava et al., 2000; Borges et al., 2001) and its later deformation during the Cenozoic, especially in the Miocene (Ribeiro et al., 1990; Zitellini et al., 2009). Cenozoic evolution in the Gulf of Cádiz was controlled by the Alpine tectonic phases that affected the southern part of Europe. During the Pliocene and Quaternary, glacio-eustatic variations rather overprinted structural effects on the margin and resulted in erosion, sedimentary progradation, and incision of major submarine canyons (Mougenot, 1988; Alves et al., 2003; Terrinha et al., 2003, 2009).  

The Gulf of Cádiz straddles this oblique-compressive zone between the Eurasia and Africa plates, extending from the Gloria transform fault zone to the Gibraltar arc, which marks the western front of the Betic-Rif collisional orogen. Since the late Miocene, the northwest–southeast compressional regime developed simultaneously with the extensional collapse of the Betic-Rif orogenic front by westward emplacement  of  a  giant  “olistostrome,”  the  Cádiz Allochthonous Unit, and by very high rates of basin subsidence coupled with strong diapiric activity. At the end of the Messinian, a transtensional regime caused reopening of the connection between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean through the Gibraltar  

Gateway (Maldonado et al., 1999). By the end of the early Pliocene, subsidence decreased and the margin evolved toward its present, more stable condition (Maldonado et al., 1999; Maestro et al., 2003; Medialdea et al., 2004), although the Cádiz Allochthonous Unit provides an unstable substratum for late Miocene, Pliocene, and Quaternary sedimentation (Medialdea et al., 2004; Zitellini et al., 2009). Some neotectonic reactivation is also evident, as expressed by the occurrence of mud volcanoes, diapiric ridges (Diaz-del-Río  et  al.,  2003;  Somoza  et  al.,  2003; Gutscher, 2004; Fernández-Puga et al., 2007), and fault reactivation (Maestro et al., 1998; Gràcia et al., 2003a, 2003b; Lobo et al., 2003; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009). Tectonic activity represents a key long-term factor in affecting seafloor morphology, which has exerted strong control on the pathways of MOW and, therefore, the architecture of the CDS.  

# Oceanographic setting  

The present-day circulation pattern is dominated by exchange of water masses through the Gibraltar Gateway (Fig. F3). This exchange is driven by highly saline and warm MOW flowing out of the Mediterranean Sea near the bottom and the turbulent, less saline, cool-water mass of Atlantic water flowing east and into the Mediterranean Sea at the surface. MOW forms a strong bottom current flowing toward the west and northwest above North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) (Madelain, 1970; Melières, 1974; Zenk, 1975; Thorpe, 1976; Ambar and Howe, 1979).  

After it exits through the Gibraltar Gateway, MOW represents an intermediate water mass that is warm and very saline and flows to the northwest along the middle slope (Fig. F3) under Atlantic Inflow and above NADW (Zenk, 1975; Thorpe, 1976; Gardner and Kidd, 1983; Ochoa and Bray, 1991; Baringer and Price, 1999). MOW also represents a flux of ${\sim}1.78~\mathrm{Sv}$ through the Gibraltar Gateway, composed of both Levantine Intermediate Water and Western Mediterranean Deep Water (Bryden and Stommel, 1984; Bryden et al., 1994; Millot, 1999, 2009), and generates  important  alongslope sedimentary processes along  the  Atlantic  margin  (Serra  et  al.,  2010a, 2010b). In the Gulf of Cádiz, MOW flows between 500 and 1400 meters below sea level (mbsl) at a velocity close to $300~\,\mathrm{cm/s}$ at the Gibraltar Gateway (Ambar and Howe, 1979) and ${\sim}80{-}100~\mathrm{cm/s}$ at the latitude of Cape São Vicente (Cherubin et al., 2000). Distribution of MOW is conditioned by the complex morphology of the continental slope, which generates two main cores: between 500 and $700\ \mathrm{mbsl}$ (upper core or Mediterranean upper water [MU]) and between  800  and  1400  mbsl  (lower  core  or Mediterranean lower water [ML]). ML is further divided into three branches (Fig. F3) (Madelain, 1970; Zenk, 1975; Ambar and Howe, 1979; Johnson and Stevens, 2000; Borenäs et al., 2002). In the western sectors, the interaction of these branches with the seafloor generates large internal eddies of MOW, known as “meddies” (Richardson et al., 2000).  

After exiting the Gulf of Cádiz, MOW has three principal branches (Fig. F4): the main branch flows to the north, the second to the west, and the third to the south, reaching the Canary Islands and then veering toward the west (Iorga and Lozier, 1999; Slater, 2003). The northern branch flows along the middle slope of the Portuguese margin and is further divided into two branches by the influence of Galicia Bank (Fig. F4). These two branches return to converge and subsequently circulate to the east in the Gulf of Biscay, following the continental slope contour (Fig. F4). MOW reaches Porcupine Bank and partly circulates to the north along Rockall Trough until reaching the Norwegian Sea (Iorga and Lozier, 1999; Slater, 2003).  

Between $\mathord{\sim}500$ and $1500\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{\mbsl}}$ , the water column along the West Iberian margin is dominated by warm, salty MOW, the two cores of which are centered at $\mathord{\sim}800$ and 1200 mbsl (Ambar and Howe, 1979), flow as undercurrents northward along the margin, and also spread westward. Below MOW at ${\sim}1600\,\mathrm{mbsl}$ , Labrador Sea Water can be found on the margin north of $40.5\mathrm{^\circN}$ (Fiuza et al., 1998). Below $2000\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ , recirculated Northeast Atlantic Deep Water prevails, representing a mixture of Labrador Sea Water, Iceland Scotland Overflow Water, Denmark Strait Overflow Water, and, to a lesser extent, MOW and Lower Deep Water (LDW) (van Aken, 2000). Abyssal water in the region consists of a lower fringe of Northeast Atlantic Deep Water that includes an increasing component of southern-sourced LDW with depth until ${\sim}4000~\mathrm{\mbsl}$ , where LDW dominates. Circulation of these water masses is summarized in Hernández-Molina et al. (2011a).  

# Morphosedimentary and stratigraphic framework  

The major part of the Gulf of Cádiz comprises a pronounced outward bulge sloping to the west with irregular surface relief (Fig. F5). The principal physiographic features of this broad slope are  

• A shelf-break located between 100 and 140 mbsl,  

• A steeper $(2^{\circ}{-3^{\circ}})$ upper slope between 150 and 400 mbsl,   
• Two gently dipping $(<\!1^{\circ})$ wide terraces at 500–750 and 800–1200 mbsl on the middle slope crossed by channels and ridges that trend northeast, and   
• A smooth lower slope $(0.5^{\circ}{-}1^{\circ})$ that extends to around 4000 mbsl.  

For the most part, this slope lacks submarine canyons, except in the western area of the Algarve margin (Hernández-Molina et al., 2006; Mulder et al., 2006; Marchès et al., 2007; Roque et al., 2012). The West Iberian margin is characterized by a steeper slope $(\sim\!4.5^{\circ})$ that is crossed by several major submarine canyons, but there is also a middle slope terrace (Alves et al., 2003; Terrinha et al., 2003; Llave et al., 2007).  

The interaction of MOW with the Gulf of Cádiz margin has resulted in the development of one of the most extensive and complex CDSs ever described. Many authors have highlighted this interaction and have characterized the erosive and depositional features along the middle slope (e.g., Madelain, 1970; Gonthier et al., 1984; Nelson et al., 1993, 1999; Llave et al., 2001, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011; Habgood et al., 2003; Hernández-Molina et al., 2003, 2006, 2011a; Mulder et al., 2003, 2006; Hanquiez et al., 2007; Marchès et al., 2007; Roque et al., 2012). This CDS has both large depositional and erosional features (Fig. F2), conditioned by a strong current with speeds reaching nearly $300\;\mathrm{cm/s}$ close to the Strait of Gibraltar, slowing to ${\sim}60{-}80\ \mathrm{~cm/s}$ at Cape São Vicente (Kenyon and Belderson, 1973; Ambar and Howe, 1979; Cherubin et al., 2000). The main depositional features are sedimentary wave fields, sedimentary lobes, mixed drifts, plastered drifts, elongated mounded and separated drifts, and sheeted drifts. The main erosional features are contourite channels, furrows, marginal valleys, and moats. All of these features have a specific location along the margin, and their distribution defines five morphosedimentary sectors within the CDS (details can be found in Hernández-Molina et al., 2003, 2006, and Llave et al., 2007). The development of each of these five sectors at any time is related to systematic deceleration of MOW as it flows westward from the Strait of Gibraltar, caused by interaction of MOW with margin bathymetry and the effects of Coriolis force. In general, the drifts are composed mainly of muddy, silty, and sandy sediments with a mixed terrigenous (dominant component) and biogenic composition (Gonthier et al., 1984; Stow et al., 1986, 2002). In contrast, sand and gravel are found in the large contourite channels (Nelson et al., 1993, 1999), as are many erosional features (Hernández-Molina et al., 2006; García et al., 2009). In the proximal sector close to the Strait of Gibraltar, an exceptionally thick $(\sim\!815\,\textrm{m})$ sandy-sheeted drift with sand layers averaging $12–15\mathrm{~m~}$ thick (minimum thickness $=\,1.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ ; maximum thickness $=40\mathrm{~m}$ ) is present (Buitrago et al., 2001). However, while surface and near-surface sediment distribution patterns are generally well characterized, much less is known about the nature or distribution of coarser sediments at depth.  

Four major depositional sequences that are likely to be related to MOW paleoceanographic changes have been recognized in the large contourite systems of the Pliocene and Quaternary sedimentary record. The depositional sequences are separated by four major regional discontinuities (Fig. F6), which from bottom to top are late Miocene (M), intra-lower Pliocene (LPR), base Quaternary discontinuity (BQD), and mid-Pleistocene revolution (MPR) (Llave et al., 2001, 2007, 2010, 2011; Hernández-Molina et al., 2002, 2009; Stow et al., 2002, 2012). Together, these discontinuities constitute an impressive record of changes in water mass circulation and of the tectonic and/or environmental changes that have affected evolution of the margin; however, drilling is required to determine the precise nature and timing of these discontinuities.  

The deeper Portuguese margin sediments outside the influence of MOW, by contrast, are dominated by hemipelagic muds, with variable admixtures of terrigenous silt and sand, and biogenic components (Baas et al., 1997). Pelagic sedimentation prevails during interglacial periods. Input of terrigenous material is enhanced during glacial periods because of lowered sea level and input from local sources such as density-driven slope lateral advection and lowconcentration turbidity currents, as well as minor influences from bottom currents and ice rafting. High sedimentation rates are typical in this region because of elevated fluxes in both glacial (clay) and interglacial (silt) material; however, distinct climate control results in enhanced sedimentation during colder periods at both orbital and millennial timescales. This pattern is observed in water depths between 2500 and $4600\;\mathrm{m}$ (Hall and McCave, 2000; Lebreiro et al., 2009). Detrital input from rivers (Tagus) is channeled by turbidity currents within submarine canyon systems (Lebreiro et al., 2009) and across abyssal plains (Lebreiro et al., 1997) and does not affect open slope deposition. Ice-rafted detritus occasionally reached the Iberian margin during the last glacial period, especially during Heinrich events, when sea-surface temperatures were very low (Lebreiro et al., 1996; Baas et al., 1997; Cayre et al., 1999; Thouveny et al., 2000; de Abreu et al., 2003).  

# Neotectonic implications  

Tectonism  during  the  Pliocene  and  Quaternary caused by the broad northwest–south-east compressional regime determined in the short term the local thickness, geometry, and present position of various depositional bodies and in the long term also contributed to paleoceanographic changes. Several features of the CDS in the Gulf of Cádiz and west of Portugal can be related to this recent tectonic activity, which has involved the reactivation of faults and diapiric structures related to local movements (Maldonado et al., 1999; Medialdea et al., 2004, 2009; Fernández-Puga et al., 2007; Neves et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009). The most recent tectonic activity has directly created the conditions that led to several features (Llave et al., 2001, 2003; Hernández-Molina et al., 2003; García et al., 2009), including  

• The recent configuration of the channels and ridges sector,   
• The inactivity of several fossil mounded and sheeted drifts identified in Sectors 3 and 4,   
• The recent genesis of the Diego Cão Channel, and   
• The recent overexcavation and northward migration of the Cádiz Channel.  

On the West Iberian margin, recent tectonic activity is variable from north to south. The Lisbon margin in the north has undergone significant subsidence through the Pliocene and Quaternary. The Alentejo margin further south has undergone moderate subsidence during the early Pliocene but evolved to a region of mixed transpression-transtension during the late Pliocene and Quaternary, in association with uplift of Gorringe Bank. Neotectonic activity is recognized in this area at the present time (Alves et al., 2003; Gràcia et al., 2003a, 2003b; Terrinha et al., 2003; Zitellini et al., 2009).  

# Seismic studies/Site survey data  

A broad database of Gulf of Cádiz and West Iberian   
margin information collected over the past $40~\mathrm{y}$ by   
many different nations and cruises provides a superb   
template for drilling. This database is composed of   
the following:   
• Bathymetric data, including swath bathymetry of the middle slope using Simrad EM12S-120 and EM300 multibeam echo-sounder systems;   
• Side-scan sonar image data from Seamap, OKEAN, geological long range inclined Asdic (GLORIA), and towed ocean bottom instrument (TOBI) systems;   
• An extensive seismic data grid, including low-resolution multichannel seismic profiles from oil  

companies (mainly REPSOL and TGS-NOPEC); medium-resolution seismic profiles from Sparker, Air gun, Geopulse, and Uniboom systems; highresolution seismic profiles using a $3.5\;\mathrm{kHz}$ system; and ultrahigh-resolution seismic profiles using topographic parametric sonar (TOPAS); A variety of core data, ranging from box cores and short gravity cores to giant piston cores; • More than 3000 submarine photographs taken with a BENTHOS-372 camera; and • Physical oceanographic information.  

# Objectives  

Drilling in the Gulf of Cádiz and off the West Iberian margin offers a unique opportunity to tackle key scientific goals enumerated in the IODP ISP related to  

• Oceanic gateways and their global influence,   
• Paleocirculation and climate,   
• Rapid climate change,   
• Sea level and related controls on sediment architecture, and   
• Neotectonic activity and controls on continental margin sedimentation.  

The extensive CDS that has been developing within the Gulf of Cádiz and extending around the West Iberian margin over the past $5\ \mathrm{m.y}$ . is a direct result of MOW (e.g., Madelain, 1970; Gonthier et al., 1984; Faugères et al., 1985; Nelson et al., 1993, 1999; Llave et al., 2001, 2006, 2007, 2010, submitted; Stow et al., 2002; Habgood et al., 2003; Hernández-Molina et al., 2003, 2006, 2011a; Mulder et al., 2003, 2006; Hanquiez et al., 2007; Marchès et al., 2007; Roque et al., 2012). The high accumulation rates and expanded sedimentary records of drift deposits permit highresolution  examination  of  past  environmental change (Llave et al., 2005; Voelker et al., 2006). The CDS deposits, therefore, hold the very best signal of MOW flow through the Gibraltar Gateway and a clear record of its influence on the oceanography and climate of the North Atlantic Ocean and on NADW variability (Bigg and Wadley, 2001a, 2001b; Bigg et al., 2003). However, the region had not previously  been  drilled  for  scientific  purposes,  even though the Gibraltar Gateway clearly has major implications for global climate and oceanography. The deeper target off western Portugal (APL-763) lies outside the direct influence of MOW but contains an expanded record of primarily hemipelagic sediment with which we can develop a Pleistocene marine archive of climate change.  

We identified five broad scientific objectives for the proposed drilling program.  

1. Understand the opening of the Gibraltar Gateway and onset of MOW.  

Tectonic adjustments along the suture line between the African and Eurasian plates could have led to the opening of the Gibraltar Gateway at the end of the Miocene at $5.3\,\mathrm{~Ma~}$ (Berggren and Hollister, 1974; Mulder and Parry, 1977; Maldonado et al., 1999; Blanc, 2002; Sierro et al., 2008; García-Castellanos et al., 2009). Other authors have stressed that the cut into the threshold of Gibraltar was due to regressive erosion of a stream that was flowing toward the desiccated Mediterranean Basin, resulting in the opening of the strait (Blanc, 2002; Loget and Van Den Driessche, 2006). Reopening of the Gibraltar Gateway marked the end of complete isolation of the Mediterranean Sea and the global effects of the Messinian salinity crisis (Ryan et al., 1973; Hsü et al., 1973; 1978; Comas et al., 1999; Duggen et al., 2003). Immediately following this initial opening, the gateway depth was most likely insufficient to allow very significant outflow of deep MOW into the Gulf of Cádiz. Therefore, the onset of deep MOW, the initiation of contourite drift sedimentation in the gulf, and the broader influence of warm saltwater influx in the North Atlantic lagged behind gateway opening. However, the actual timing of this event is uncertain.  

Our first objective was to drill through the drift succession and into late Miocene sediments at several different sites and therefore date the basal age of drift sedimentation in the Gulf of Cádiz. We also aimed to evaluate the nature of change in the patterns of sedimentation and microfauna/microflora from the end of the Miocene through the early to middle Pliocene, from proximal regions closest to the Gibraltar Gateway to distal regions on the West Iberian margin. This evaluation will allow us to determine any downstream variation in the onset of contourite deposition and of MOW bottom water signature.  

2. Determine MOW paleocirculation and global climate significance.  

The present-day flux of MOW through the Gibraltar Gateway is nearly $2~\mathrm{Sv}$ (i.e., $2\,\times\,10^{6}~\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{s},$ ), carrying warmer waters and $>\!3000$ tons of excess salt into the North Atlantic every second. The consequent increase in density of NADW may stabilize, or in cases of decreased MOW flux, destabilize thermohaline circulation  and  therefore  trigger  climate  change (Johnson, 1997; Rahmstorf, 1998; Bigg and Wadley, 2001a; Bigg et al., 2003). The importance of MOW in North Atlantic Ocean circulation and climate is now widely recognized. MOW millennial to long-term variability and its effects on thermohaline circulation is an active and prolific line of research at present. For example, it has been inferred that the rate of deepwater formation reached its highest level in the Mediterranean during glacial stages, which corresponds to periods when the contribution of NADW to the global ocean was at a minimum and Antarctic Bottom Water at a maximum. The cause and effect link between these observations remains unclear. There are also many other questions to resolve in this regard (e.g., Duplessy et al., 1988; Abrantes, 1988; Caralp, 1988, 1992; Sarnthein et al., 1994; Schönfeld, 1997, 2002; Cayre et al., 1999; Flower et al., 2000; Sierro et al., 2000, 2005; Shackleton et al., 2000; Schönfeld and Zahn, 2000; Cacho et al., 2000, 2001; Moreno et al., 2002; de Abreu et al., 2003; Schönfeld et al., 2003; Slater, 2003; Löwemark et al., 2004; Raymo et al., 2004; Voelker et al., 2006; Llave et al., 2006; Lebreiro et al., 2009; Lebreiro, 2010; Voelker and Lebreiro, 2010; among others).  

Our second objective was to date the principal unconformities and minor discontinuities identified on seismic records, thereby calibrating the seismic stratigraphic framework. We can therefore assess their link to paleocirculation variation and events and evaluate their global correlation and significance. Detailed reconstruction of paleoceanographic conditions over centennial, millennial, and longer timescales at high resolution will disclose their evolution through time and help elucidate the background driving forces.  

3. Establish a marine reference section of Pleistocene climate (rapid climate change).  

Few marine sediment cores have played such a pivotal role in paleoclimate research as those from the Portuguese margin Shackleton sites, a name chosen to honor Nick Shackleton’s seminal work in highlighting the global importance of these sections (Shackleton et al., 2000). These cores preserve a highfidelity record of millennial-scale climate variability for the last glacial cycle that can be correlated precisely to polar ice cores in both hemispheres (Fig. F7). Moreover, the narrow continental shelf off Portugal results in rapid delivery of terrestrial material (e.g., pollen) to the deep-sea environment, thereby permitting correlation of marine and ice-core records to European terrestrial sequences. IODP drilling at Site U1385 (proposed Site Shack-04 near the location of piston Core MD01-2444) on the West Iberian margin during Expedition 339 provided a rare opportunity to recover a marine reference section of Pleistocene  climate  variability  that  can  be  correlated confidently to polar ice cores and terrestrial archives. Our third objective (and the principal objective of Site U1385 [APL-763]) was to recover a Quaternary sediment archive offshore Portugal that will greatly improve the precision with which marine sediment records of climate change are correlated to and compared with ice-core and terrestrial records. By yielding multiproxy records that can be placed on an integrated stratigraphy, drilling of Site U1385 should provide major advances in our ability to reconstruct millennial-scale climate variability during the Pleistocene–Holocene  and  understand  its  underlying causes.  

4. Identify external controls on sediment architecture of the Gulf of Cádiz CDS and West Iberian margin.  

The effects of sea level change on Pliocene–Quaternary sedimentary architecture in the Gulf of Cádiz and along the West Iberian margin have been considerably amplified by the direct influence of the Gibraltar Gateway cross-sectional area (see above). Detailed analysis of the sedimentary architecture of CDS drift deposits is essential to distinguishing between climate and sea level change and to the further development of the global sequence stratigraphic model. In particular, the global role of bottom currents and evolution of alongslope depositional systems has not been adequately considered as a major component of the generalized sequence stratigraphic framework for continental margins. Furthermore, the cyclicity of MOW flux and resultant deposits has a relationship to eustatic influences on the Gibraltar sill that needs to be defined as a control on circulation of the entire North Atlantic.  

Our fourth objective was to establish the nature of sedimentation and the timing of associated hiatuses by first-order drilling, dating, facies analysis, and correlation between all drill sites. This will further allow us to determine the stacking pattern and evolution of the Pliocene–Quaternary drift deposits and evaluate contourite cyclicity at seismic to sediment scales. Combining facies analysis and sedimentation rates with detailed compositional studies allows a more complete understanding of sediment supply and remobilization within the bottom-current system and quantification of a sedimentary budget and flux for the CDS in the gulf.  

5. Ascertain synsedimentary neotectonic control on architecture and evolution of the CDS.  

Charting the chronology of neotectonic activity that has had significant effect on development and architecture of the CDS is essential to a more complete understanding of the margin system in this region. Margin evolution anywhere is controlled by complex interaction of many different forcing variables, most importantly sea level and climate, sediment supply, and tectonics. The Gulf of Cádiz provides an excellent example of how recent tectonic activity has markedly affected submarine topography (Medialdea et al., 2004; Hernández-Molina et al., 2006; Fernández-Puga et al., 2007; Llave et al., 2007; García et al., 2009; Rosas et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2011) and, consequently, controlled changes in the distribution of branches of MOW and their influence in the North Atlantic (Llave et al., 2007). The initiation and early history of MOW with regard to timing and tectonic control of the Gibraltar Gateway is the focus of Objective 1 (above).  

Our fifth objective was to chart the chronology of neotectonic activity that has had significant effect on development and architecture of the CDS and to identify the principal morphological changes that have resulted from this tectonic activity. We will thus be able to evaluate the direct influence of recent diapiric activity on the evolution of the CDS, particularly with regard to the erosion of channels and moats through the softer cores of diapir strings. There is also an excellent opportunity to determine the  rate  of  diapiric  movement  and  its  change through time.  

# Site summaries Site U1385  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1385 is located at $2585~\mathrm{mbsl}$ on the southwestern Iberian margin $(37^{\circ}34.285^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\cdot}$ ; $10^{\circ}7.562^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) near the position of Core MD01-2444 (Fig. F8), which contains a detailed record of millennial-scale variability for the last $190\ \mathrm{k.y.}$ . (Fig. F9). The overall objective of this site was to recover a late Pleistocene sediment record needed to extend this remarkable record to $1.4\,\mathrm{~Ma~}$ . The acquired record will greatly improve the precision with which marine sediment records of climate change can be correlated to and compared with polar ice cores and European terrestrial records.  

Site U1385 was occupied on 25 November 2011. Five holes were cored at this site using the advanced piston corer (APC) and nonmagnetic core barrels (Fig. F10). Four holes were cored to $\mathord{\sim}150$ mbsf and one (Hole U1385C) to just 9.5 mbsf (1 core). A total of 67 cores were collected to obtain $622\,\textrm{m}$ of sediment ( $103\%$ recovery). The advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) was deployed 12 times.  

# Main results  

The sediment at Site U1385 is defined as a single lithologic unit. Unit I is a very uniform lithology composed of a Holocene–Pleistocene sequence dominated by bioturbated calcareous muds and calcareous clays that vary in the relative proportion of biogenic carbonate material $(23\%{-}39\%)$ , as shown by color variation from lighter (i.e., more calcareous) to darker (i.e., more terrigenous) sediment (Fig. F11). Relatively more terrigenous-dominated sediment is present in the upper quarter of Unit I, but its occurrence does not warrant the definition of any additional lithologic units or subunits. No primary sedimentary  structures  were  observed; however, bioturbation is the most obvious secondary sedimentary structure and ranges from sparse to moderate. Other features, such as small-scale subvertical microfaults and contorted lamination, are present at several depth intervals. These features are local and of minor importance and do not seriously disrupt the continuity of the stratigraphic section. The entire section cored at this site is therefore considered to be typical hemipelagic deposits with an average sedimentation rate of ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ .  

The five holes cored at Site U1385 provided ample sediment for constructing a complete spliced stratigraphic section containing no notable gaps or disturbed intervals. A primary splice was constructed using all holes and provides an optimal composite section for all physical and magnetic properties measured using pass-through multisensor tracks (Figs. F10, F11). Two nearly complete secondary splices were also constructed, one using intervals from Holes U1385A and U1385B and the other using intervals from Holes U1385D and U1385E. These alternate splices will maximize the core material available for sampling while adhering to IODP sampling policy.  

Biostratigraphy at Site U1385 is based on the shipboard study of calcareous nannofossils and planktonic and benthic foraminifers in core catcher samples  from  Holes  U1385A–U1385D  and  the  five lowermost core catcher samples of Hole U1385E. Nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers are very abundant and relatively well preserved in all samples. Benthic foraminifers are also relatively abundant and diverse; however, ostracods are rare and pteropods were not observed in any samples downhole with the exception of the mudline sample. Pollen and spores are generally abundant and moderately  well  preserved,  providing  an  excellent opportunity for marine-terrestrial correlations. The chronological framework for Site U1385 is mainly based on calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer events as well as one benthic foraminifer datum, suggesting a continuous Pleistocene record with a nearly uniform sedimentation rate of ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ . The age of the base of the section is estimated to be ${\sim}1.4\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) intensity ranges from $\sim\!10^{-5}$ to $\sim\!10^{-2}\ \mathrm{A/m}$ . Within the uppermost $50\;\mathrm{m}$ , the intensity is on the order of $10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ , but below ${\sim}60$ mbsf the intensity decreases to $\sim\!10^{-3}$ to $\sim\!10^{-5}$ . The correlation between remanent intensity and magnetic susceptibility suggests that the magnetic minerals that carry the NRM are the same grains that dominate the magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic susceptibility generally varies between $10~\times$ $10^{-5}$ and $50\,\times\,10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}$ (Fig. F10). The Brunhes–Matuyama polarity transition $(0.781\,\mathrm{~Ma})$ as well as the termination and beginning of the Jaramillo Subchron (C1r.1n; 0.988 and $1.072\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively) are identified at Site U1385. In addition, a brief normal polarity interval is tentatively interpreted to represent the Cobb Mountain Subchron (C1r.2n; 1.173– $1.185\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ). Postcruise paleomagnetic analysis of samples from Site U1385 will provide a reliable record of variations in relative paleointensity of Earth’s geomagnetic field.  

The most notable aspect of all physical property records at Site U1385 is a gradual reduction of magnetic susceptibility values beginning at $\mathord{\sim}30$ mbsf (Fig. F10). Despite the reduction in intensity, magnetic susceptibility displays distinct high-amplitude variability until 50 mbsf, being comparatively low and less variable downhole. This main change between 30 and 60 mbsf seems to correspond to a general change in lithology and/or diagenetic overprint (i.e., mirrored in low natural gamma ray [NGR] counts and high $\mathrm{L}^{\star}$ values) (Figs. F10, F11). A likely cause for the overall decrease of magnetic susceptibility is the reduction of fine-grained magnetite to iron sulfides within the sulfate reduction zone. Highfrequency variations show a close correlation to gamma ray attenuation (GRA) densities, likely reflecting varying relative amounts of clay and carbonate. There is also a notable positive correlation between NGR and magnetic susceptibility below 40 mbsf that is not apparent above this depth, hinting at a change in the factors influencing the sedimentary composition during this interval.  

Organic carbon is generally low $({<}1\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ and the $\mathrm{{C/N}}$ ratio indicates that the organic carbon is mainly of marine origin. Diagenesis of organic matter has led to depletion of dissolved sulfate in interstitial waters. In this process, sulfate is consumed and alkalinity, ammonium, and phosphate are produced as by-products. The increase in alkalinity promotes authigenic precipitation of carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite and dolomite), consistent with decreases in magnesium and calcium concentrations in the sulfate reduction zone. Hydrogen sulfide ions produced by sulfate reduction and anaerobic methane oxidation can react with iron to form iron sulfide minerals, which are paramagnetic and have lower susceptibility than magnetite. This process may explain the decrease in magnetic susceptibility observed below ${\sim}40$ mbsf. Interstitial water oxygen and hydrogen isotope values of show considerable variability in the uppermost $30\,\textrm{m}$ , which is unexpected from a profile that should be dominated by diffusion.  

The measured geothermal gradient at Site U1385 is ${\sim}39.2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ , and the estimated heat flow is 47.5 $\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ , which is in the lower half of the normal range for heat flow on the Portuguese margin.  

# Highlights  

Exactly as predicted, drilling at Site U1385 recovered a continuous $1.4\,\mathrm{~m.y~}$ record (lithologic Unit I) of hemipelagic deposits with an average sedimentation rate of ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . The multiple-spliced records recovered  in  five  holes  provide  essential  material needed for postcruise studies of millennial-scale climate variability through the Pleistocene and Holocene. Variations in physical properties and color display  cyclic  changes  that  reflect  changes  in  the proportion of biogenic carbonate and detrital material delivered to the site. These variations will prove useful to orbitally tune the record at Site U1385, serve as a marine reference section of Pleistocene climate variability, and significantly improve the precision with which marine climate records can be correlated to polar ice cores and terrestrial sequences.  

# Site U1386  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1386 is located at $561~\mathrm{mbsl}$ on the southern Iberian margin $(36^{\circ}49.685^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\cdot}$ ; $7^{\circ}45.321^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ) ${\sim}25\ \mathrm{km}$ south-southeast of the Portuguese city of Faro (Fig. F1). Of all sites drilled during Expedition 339, this site is the most distal from the Gibraltar Gateway, within the depositional sector of the Cádiz CDS. The site targets the eastern end of an elongated mounded and separated drift (the Faro Drift) that has a total length of $100\,\mathrm{km}$ , a maximum width of $20\;\mathrm{km}$ , and a maximum thickness of ${\sim}700\mathrm{~m~}$ .  

The Faro Drift represents a classic example of middle-slope contourite deposits, which show a well-layered internal acoustic structure with laterally extensive,  aggradational  to  progradational  seismic depositional units and widespread discontinuities (Fig. F12). Faro Drift has been developing along the middle slope over the past $4{-}5\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ . under the direct influence of MOW and therefore holds a clear signal of MOW through the Gibraltar Gateway, which reopened following tectonic adjustments at the end of the Messinian salinity crisis.  

Our primary objective was to recover a key Pleistocene and Holocene sedimentary succession formed under the influence of MU, and hence a clear record of MOW influence on the North Atlantic Ocean. The high rates of accumulation and expanded sedimentary record of this drift site should permit high-resolution examination of past environmental change (climatic and eustatic). This site is complementary to Site U1387, located ${\sim}4.1~\mathrm{km}$ southeast, which targets a Pliocene and lower Pleistocene sedimentary record also influenced by MU.  

Site U1386 was occupied on 30 November 2011. Three holes were drilled and cored using the APC, extended core barrel (XCB), and rotary core barrel (RCB), achieving the target depth of 526 mbsf in Hole U1386C. Downhole logging was carried out in Hole U1386C using the triple combination (triple combo), Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic, and Versatile Sonic Imager (VSI) tool strings. Overall recovery at Site U1386 was $351\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(102\%)$ with the APC, $417.6~\mathrm{~m~}$ $(89\%)$ with the XCB, and $82\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(58.5\%)$ with the RCB. The total cored interval at Site U1386 was $954.4\mathrm{~m~}$ , and total recovery was $850.6\mathrm{~m~}$ $(89\%)$ .  

# Main results  

The sedimentary succession at Site U1386 extends from the latest Miocene to Holocene (Fig. F13). It is divided into two lithologic units (I and II), distinguished on the basis of inferred depositional process. Unit I is a Pleistocene–Holocene sequence dominated by classic contourite deposition, including nannofossil mud, calcareous silty mud, and silty bioclastic sand lithologies. These three lithologies are generally organized as bi-gradational sequences, the most complete of which coarsen upward from nannofossil mud to calcareous silty mud to silty bioclastic sand and then fine upward through calcareous silty mud into nannofossil mud. Unit I is divided into three subunits (IA, IB, and IC) based on the relative importance of the silty muds and silty sands. Thin turbidite intercalations occur very rarely in the uppermost part of Subunit IA and more commonly in the lowermost $30\;\mathrm{m}$ of Subunit IC.  

Unit II is a late Miocene–Pleistocene sequence characterized by the deposits of downslope processes interbedded with contouritic and hemipelagic nannofossil muds. The downslope facies include mediumand thick-bedded disorganized turbidites and thick to very thick bedded chaotic debrites. Quartz-lithic– rich turbidites are more common in the uppermost part, whereas debrites and bioclastic (shelly) turbidites are typical of the lowermost part.  

Calcareous  microfossils  (nannofossils,  planktonic and benthic foraminifers, and ostracods) are mostly common to abundant with moderate to good preservation through Unit I but occur more sporadically and with poorer preservation through Unit II. The sedimentary record is continuous for the most part in the Holocene and Pleistocene to ${\sim}1.9\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , with an average sedimentation rate of $35~\mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ . between 0 and 384 mbsf (contourite dominated) decreasing to $15\;\;\mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ . between 384 and 453 mbsf (turbidite dominated). Preliminary shipboard dating suggests the presence of a major hiatus before $1.9\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , which cuts out much of the early Pleistocene and late Pliocene, and a somewhat discontinuous record through the debrite-dominated section. The lowermost $15~\mathrm{m}$ of the record is most likely of Messinian age $(<\!5.8$ Ma).  

The observed variability in both benthic foraminifer and ostracod distribution seems to reveal significant changes in depositional processes and bottom water environmental conditions over the last ${\sim}5\,\mathrm{~m.y~}$ . In general, marked mixing with shelf-derived taxa in the lower part of the succession is a result of direct input from downslope processes and progressive upward increase in cold-water taxa. Periodic increases in bottom-current energy and ventilation are indicated by both lithologic changes and benthic faunas. Pollen and spores are abundant in all the samples analyzed, along with microcharcoal and dinocysts. Together, these indicate significant changes in terrestrial climate and vegetation comparable with the marine record.  

Paleomagnetic measurements identified the Brunhes–Matuyama polarity transition (0.781 Ma) as well as the termination and beginning of the Jaramillo Subchron (C1r.1n; 0.988 and $1.072~\mathrm{\bf~Ma}$ ,  respectively). These events give reliable confirmation of biostratigraphic dating for Site U1386 and confirm the relatively high rates of sedimentation through the contourite succession.  

Based on the physical property data, distinct changes were identified that are commonly related to boundaries between defined lithologic units. In addition, cyclic variation in NGR and magnetic susceptibility values and persistent covariation of both parameters with sediment color appear to track decimeter-scale cyclicity in lithologic character. Especially high magnetic susceptibilities correspond to the turbiditedominated section between 420 and 445 mbsf. Below 445 mbsf, low values in NGR and magnetic susceptibility conform with a shift in the lithology to debrites and turbidites below a major hiatus.  

The interstitial water profile at Site U1386 is dominated by organic matter diagenesis with a shallow sulfate reduction zone in the uppermost $12.5\textrm{m}$ and methanogenesis below. High alkalinity associated with sulfate reduction and anaerobic methane oxidation has resulted in authigenic calcite and dolomite formation. Iron sulfide minerals formed as a consequence of sulfate reduction. A maximum in $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and δD coincident with a minimum of chloride in interstitial water suggests the influence of gas hydrates that dissociated upon core recovery.  

Downhole  measurements  were  made  in  Hole U1386C to a total depth of 526 mbsf. Despite a certain degree of borehole rugosity, the combination of logs used closely reflects both lithologic changes and cementation recorded in the recovered cores. This allowed us to infer lithologies from some of the gaps in core recovery. Preliminary inspection also revealed a marked cyclicity from 102 to 346 mbsf through the contourite section, which seems to relate to Milankovitch precession cycles of ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{\textbf{k}}.\mathrm{y}.$ . These data will be carefully scrutinized together with cycles observed in both the lithologic and physical property records.  

The measured geothermal gradient at Site U1386 is ${\sim}34.3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ , and the estimated heat flow is 42.1 $\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ .  

# Highlights  

Coring at Site U1386 on the Faro Drift recovered a thick Pleistocene–Holocene succession of mud/silt contourites,  as  anticipated.  These  successions showed a continuous record of drift sedimentation over the past $1.9\,\mathrm{\m.y.}$ . at an average sedimentation rate of $35~\mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . for the past 1 m.y. What was not expected was to reach into the latest Miocene at \~515 mbsf.  

We confirmed the classic contourite model of meterscale bi-gradational cyclicity with apparent millennial-scale forcing. There was also evidence of a strong lateral supply of terrigenous material to the bottom currents. We also recognized decimeter-scale cycles  characterized  by  relative  abundance  and thickness of silty contourites. These are provisionally related to seismic cycles with Milankovitch-scale forcing.  

At the base of the main constructional drift, interbedded turbidites and contourites are underlain by a $40\textrm{m}$ thick unit of early Pleistocene turbidite sandstones, which we tentatively relate to a phase of increased tectonic activity rather than to deposition during sea level lowstand. These directly overlie a major hiatus of $0.3–2.2\;\mathrm{m.y.}$ duration, which we provisionally relate to the aggressive action and downward erosion by bottom currents sometime after the onset of MOW. The early Pliocene succession comprises bioclastic debrites and turbidites, most likely the result of widespread tectonic activity and slope instability. These events at the very beginning of the  

Pliocene might be related to the final stages in the opening of the Gibraltar Gateway.  

# Site U1387  

Site U1387 is located at $559.1~\mathrm{mbsl}$ on the southern Iberian margin $36^{\circ}48.321^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ ; $7^{\circ}43.1321^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ) ${\sim}29\ \mathrm{km}$ south-southeast of the Portuguese city of Faro (Fig. F1). This site is a close companion to Site U1386 at the eastern end of the Faro Drift and part of the larger Cádiz CDS. Although lying only $4~\mathrm{km}$ southeast of Site U1386, interpretation of the seismic records indicates a slightly reduced Pleistocene section and an expanded Pliocene succession.  

The Faro Drift represents a classic example of middle-slope contourite deposits, showing a well-layered internal acoustic structure with laterally extensive aggradational to progradational seismic depositional units and widespread discontinuities (Fig. F6). Faro Drift has been developing along the middle slope over the past $4{-}5\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ , under the direct influence of MOW. It therefore holds a clear signal of MOW through the Gibraltar Gateway, which reopened following tectonic adjustments at the end of the Messinian salinity crisis.  

Our primary objective at this site was to recover a full Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene sedimentary succession formed under the influence of MU and also to penetrate the Miocene/Pliocene boundary. As at its companion site, the high rates of accumulation and expanded sedimentary record of this site should permit high-resolution examination of past environmental change (climatic and eustatic).  

Site U1387 was occupied on 8 December 2011. Three holes were drilled and cored using the APC, XCB, and RCB, achieving the target depth of 870 mbsf in Hole U1387C. Downhole logging was carried out in Hole U1387C using the triple combo, FMS-sonic, and VSI tool strings. Overall recovery at Site U1387 was 97 m $(103\%)$ with the APC, $578.4\;\mathrm{m}$ $(97\%)$ with the XCB, and $409.5\mathrm{~m~}(70.6\%)$ with the RCB. The total cored interval at Site U1387 was $1270.7\mathrm{~m}_{\phantom{.}}$ , and total recovery was $1084.95\;\mathrm{m}$ $(85\%)$ .  

# Main results  

The sedimentary succession at Site U1387 extends for $870\;\mathrm{m}$ from the latest Miocene to Holocene (Fig. F14) and is divided into four lithologic units (I–IV) distinguished on the basis of lithologic character and inferred depositional process. Unit I is a Pleistocene– Holocene sequence dominated by classic contourite deposition, including nannofossil mud, calcareous silty mud, and silty bioclastic sand lithologies generally organized as bi-gradational sequences. Thin turbidite intercalations occur more commonly than at  

Site U1386 and are especially noted in the lowermost $100{-}150\;\mathrm{m}$ of the unit.  

Below a more significant unconformity, Unit II is capped by two well-cemented dolomite horizons. For the most part, the unit represents Pliocene sedimentation characterized by a clear cyclic arrangement of lighter colored facies having turbidite and/ or contourite affinity and darker colored facies of pelagite affinity (Fig. F14). Close interaction between processes is apparent with more or less continuous bioturbation throughout. In Unit III, the evidence of downslope resedimentation is still more evident, including poorly sorted turbidite sandstones, chaotic debrites, and slump units as thick as $5\textrm{m}$ . Shallowwater bioclastic debris is common together with resedimented lignitic material in places. Below $\mathord{\sim}680$ mbsf, a $50\textrm{m}$ thick section includes hard calcite-cemented sandstone turbidites and poor core recovery. This unit is mainly early Pliocene in age but may start in the latest Miocene.  

Unit IV is a relatively thinner basal unit of late Miocene age with a very different character (Fig. F14) dominated by middle-slope hemipelagic sediments to nannofossil muds and muddy oozes.  

Calcareous microfossils (nannofossils, planktonic and benthic foraminifers, and ostracods) are mostly common to abundant with moderate to good preservation through lithologic Units I and IV and relatively poorer preservation through Units II and III, where considerable reworking is also apparent. The sedimentary record is continuous for the most part in the Holocene and Pleistocene to ${\sim}1.8\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , with an average sedimentation rate of $25\ \mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ Below the Pliocene– Pleistocene hiatus $_{1.8-3.2\,\mathrm{Ma})}$ at 450 mbsf (Fig. F14), the mean sedimentation rate is ${\sim}15\ \mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ ., although a significant proportion of this section comprises instantaneous event beds. The lowermost unit is most likely of Messinian age $(<6.3\mathrm{~Ma})$ .  

The observed variability in both benthic foraminifer and ostracod distribution reveals significant environmental changes over the last $\mathrm{-}5\;\mathrm{m.y.}$ ., closely comparable with those observed at Site U1386. In general, the  Pleistocene  succession  shows  typical  upper bathyal assemblages indicative of increased organic matter input and reduced ventilation. Marked mixing with shelf-derived taxa can be seen in the Pliocene part of the succession as a result of direct input from downslope processes and progressive upward increase in cold-water taxa, as noted also by planktonic assemblages. Periodic increases in bottom-current energy and ventilation are indicated by both lithologic changes and benthic faunas. Pollen and spores are abundant in most of the samples analyzed, along with microcharcoal and dinocysts. Together, these indicate normal (fresh) supply from  

Mediterranean forests and grasslands for the Pleistocene; a transitional zone mixed with corroded, reworked forms; and then a Pliocene succession with a notable absence of freshly derived pollen.  

Paleomagnetic measurements identified the Brunhes–Matuyama polarity transition (0.781 Ma) but no clear Jaramillo Subchron. Measurements also identified a reliable Matuyama–Olduvai transition (1.778 Ma) toward the base of Unit I. These measurements give reliable confirmation of the biostratigraphic dating for Site U1387 and confirm the relatively high rates of sedimentation through the contourite succession. Cyclic variation in the intensity of NRM and magnetic susceptibility requires further study.  

Physical property data show generally high values of NGR,  magnetic  susceptibility,  and  bulk  density within the uppermost $50\,\mathrm{m}$ of lithologic Unit I, with lower values downhole. Cyclic variation in values and the presence or absence of covariation between different parameters (and with sediment color) show a complex track of decimeter-scale cyclicity noted in lithologic character. In some cases, high magnetic susceptibility values correspond to individual turbidites within the Pleistocene section but not those in the Pliocene.  

The interstitial water profile at Site U1387 shows a shallow sulfate reduction zone similar to that found at Site U1386, followed by transition to methanogenesis. This shallow zone is assumed to be related to high rates of organic matter accumulation. High alkalinity associated with sulfate reduction and anaerobic methane oxidation resulted in authigenic calcite and dolomite formation. Iron sulfide minerals also formed as a consequence of sulfate reduction.  

Downhole  measurements  were  made  in  Hole U1387C to a bridged-hole depth of 649 mbsf with the first tool string. Further bridging was found by subsequent tool strings at shallower depths. Moderately severe borehole rugosity severely hampered shipboard interpretation, although the combination of  logs  used  generally  reflects  both  lithologic changes and cementation recorded in the recovered cores. Apparent cyclicity in some parts of the section will require further study following an attempt to correct for variation in borehole diameter. The sonic log and vertical seismic profile will be useful in refining our interpretation of key reflectors on seismic profiles at this site. Only one downhole temperature measurement was achieved at the site because of the shallow change to XCB drilling at ${\sim}47$ mbsf.  

# Highlights  

Although only $4\ \mathrm{km}$ apart, Sites U1386 and U1387 on the Faro Drift showed some interesting and significant differences, as well as similarities. The same thick Pleistocene–Holocene succession of mud/silt contourites was found at Site U1387, indicating a relatively continuous record of mounded drift construction over the past $1.8\,\mathrm{~m.y.}$ . at an average sedimentation  rate  of $25\ \ \mathrm{cm/k.y}$ .  Meter-scale  bigradational contourite cyclicity was common, with evidence of a strong lateral supply of terrigenous material to the bottom currents, especially before ${\sim}1.8$ Ma. Decimeter-scale cycles characterized by relative abundance and thickness of silty contourites are most evident on physical property and downhole logs. These correlate well between sites and with Milankovitch-scale forcing. The same extended Pliocene–Pleistocene hiatus $({\sim}1.4\ \mathrm{m.y.})$ is recognized as being related to a phase of highly active MOW but within drift rather than at the floor of a channel, which was the case at Site U1386.  

Interbedded contourites and turbidites characterize the later Pliocene phase of sheeted drift construction with clear evidence of process interaction. The early Pliocene is dominated by resedimented facies, including debrites, slump deposits, and channel-fill turbidite sandstones. This is further evidence of widespread tectonic activity and slope instability at a time close to the opening of the Gibraltar Gateway.  

# Site U1388  

Site U1388 is located at $663\,\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ on the southern Iberian margin $(36^{\circ}16.142^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\cdot}$ ; $6^{\circ}47.647^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ) ${\sim}50\ \mathrm{km}$ southwest of the Spanish city of Cádiz (Fig. F1). This site lies within the extensive Cádiz sand sheet, which is in the proximal part of the larger Cádiz CDS, and is the Expedition 339 site drilled closest to the Gibraltar Gateway  

The Cádiz sand sheet represents an important example of very poorly studied sandy contourite deposits on a middle-slope terrace. The seismic profiles show a well-layered internal acoustic structure with laterally extensive, aggradational to seismic depositional units; some thin intervals of lateral progradation; and inferred section discontinuities (Fig. F15). This sand sheet has accumulated on a middle-slope terrace over the past $4{-}5\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ . under the direct influence of MOW.  

Our primary objective at this site was to recover a full Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene sedimentary succession formed under the influence of MOW close to its exit from the Gibraltar Gateway. Site U1388 was intended as our deepest penetration site (1550 mbsf).  

Site U1388 was occupied on 18 December 2011. Three holes were drilled and cored using the APC, XCB, and RCB, but a depth of only 226 mbsf was achieved in the third hole (U1388C). The site was terminated prematurely as a result of hole instability; downhole logging was considered unwise. Overall recovery for Site U1388 was $3.6\textrm{m}$ $(107\%)$ with the APC, $107~\mathrm{m}$ $(47\%)$ with the XCB, and $10.4~\mathrm{m}$ $(43\%)$ with the RCB. The total cored interval for Site U1388 was $253\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and total recovery was $121\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(47.8\%)$ , which was significantly lower than at the other expedition sites.  

# Main results  

The sedimentary succession at Site U1388 extends $226\,\textrm{m}$ from the mid-Pleistocene to Holocene (Fig. F16) and comprises a single lithologic unit notable for its distinctly sandy nature and consequent low core recovery. The principal lithologies include sand, silty sand, and silty mud, all calcareous in nature with $10\%{-}25\%$ carbonate content, which is part bioclastic and part detrital in origin. On the assumption that much of the missing material is unconsolidated sand, the upper $100\,\mathrm{m}$ is sandier than the underlying $50\;\mathrm{m}$ . The remainder of the unit comprises alternating $20{-}30\;\mathrm{m}$ thick units of sand- and mud-rich material. A range of bi-gradational, normal-graded, and reverse-graded sequences occur, which are interpreted as mainly contouritic in nature, although further work is required to improve our understanding of the depositional process.  

Calcareous  microfossils  (nannofossils,  planktonic and benthic foraminifers, ostracods, and rare pteropods) are much less abundant than at other sites but generally show good to very good preservation. The section is inferred to reach an age of ${<}0.56–0.7\ \mathrm{Ma}_{}$ , with a sedimentation rate of $60\,\mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . Temperate to subtropical conditions are indicated by the planktonic foraminifer assemblages. Benthic foraminifers show typical upper bathyal assemblages, some mixing with shelf-derived taxa, and variation in ventilation and/or MOW intensity.  

Paleomagnetic measurements from all three holes indicate that only the Brunhes normal polarity chron (C1n) is recorded in these sediments, which confirms the biostratigraphic dating. Neither the intensity of NMR nor magnetic susceptibility values are especially high. Physical property data show a correspondence between higher magnetic susceptibility and sandier layers within the more mud-prone sections; otherwise, the data are relatively poor.  

The interstitial water profile at Site U1388 shows a relatively deep sulfate reduction zone in which sulfate reduces to zero levels at ${\sim}50$ mbsf followed by transition to methanogenesis. This corresponds to a level of increased authigenic dolomite recorded in the cores. An anomalous increase in both Na and Cl is  apparent  downhole,  indicating  mixing  with deeper saline waters. Total organic carbon values of $0.2–0.8\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ are relatively lower than at other sites  

# Highlights  

Although drilling was difficult, recovery was generally poor, and the site was terminated early because of hole instability, the sediments recovered form a very important part of the MOW story. High rates of sedimentation and a generally sand-rich section testify to intensified MOW flow coupled with abundant sediment supply. These sandy contourites represent the best record we have to date of this facies type, which appears to be significantly different from the downflow counterparts at other drilled sites. Also, the presence of thick mud-rich intervals records variable MOW intensity over the past ${\sim}0.6\ \mathrm{m.y}$ . during construction of a sand-prone sheeted contourite drift.  

# Site U1389  

Site U1389 is located at $644~\mathrm{mbsl}$ on the southern Iberian margin $(36^{\circ}25.515^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\cdot}$ ; $7^{\circ}16.683^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) ${\sim}90\ \mathrm{km}$ west of the Spanish city of Cádiz (Fig. F1). This site is one of two sites in the “channels and ridges” sector of the larger Cádiz CDS and is perched on a relative topographic high, which is currently elevated $50-$ $250\,\textrm{m}$ above the flanking contourite channels and lies ${\sim}4\ \mathrm{km}$ northwest of the Guadalquivir diapiric ridge.  

We designate this as the Huelva sheeted/patch drift, which is in fact a small remnant of a much larger middle-slope sheeted drift system that has been dissected by several contourite channels. Huelva Channel lies along the northern flank and Guadalquivir Channel along the southern flank of Huelva Drift. Seismic profiles show a well-layered internal acoustic structure with laterally extensive, mainly aggradational seismic depositional units and widespread discontinuities (Fig. F17). A complex erosional-depositional relationship exists between drift and flanking channel. Huelva Drift has been developing in this region over the past $4\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ , at least, and is presently under the influence of ML.  

Our primary objective at this site was to recover a Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene sedimentary succession formed under the influence of ML and to compare this record with those found at Sites U1386 and U1387, which formed under MU.  

Site U1389 was occupied on 21 December 2011. Five holes were drilled and cored using the APC, XCB, and RCB, achieving the target depth of 990 mbsf in the fifth hole (U1389E). Downhole logging was carried out in Holes U1389A and U1389E using the triple combo, FMS-sonic, and VSI tool strings. Overall recovery for Site U1389 was $307~\mathrm{m}$ $(104\%)$ with the APC, 464 m $(90.5\%)$ with the XCB, and $352\mathrm{~m~}(54\%)$ with the RCB. The total cored interval for Site U1389 was $1463.4\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , and total recovery was $1123.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(77\%)$ .  

# Main results  

The sedimentary succession at Site U1389 extends for $990\ \mathrm{m}$ from the early Pliocene to Holocene (Fig. F18) and is represented by a thick, rapidly accumulated, and very uniform series of contouritic sediment assigned to a single lithologic unit and divided into five subunits (IA–IE). Unit I is dominated by classic contourite deposition, including calcareous mud, silty mud, sandy mud, and silty bioclastic sand lithologies. These are generally organized as bi-gradational sequences and partial sequences, of which base-cut-out, normally graded sequences are more common  than  top-cut-out,  inversely  graded  sequences. Carbonate content ranges from 21 to 35 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ , and total organic carbon ranges from 0.3 to 1.8 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ . The division of Unit I into five subunits is based on subtle changes in the relative abundance of the different lithologies and silt/sand intervals.  

Calcareous  microfossils  (nannofossils,  planktonic and benthic foraminifers, and ostracods) are mostly common to abundant with moderate to good preservation throughout. Pteropod fragments are more common at this site than at any of the other sites, mainly within the uppermost $30\textrm{m}$ . The sedimentary record is continuous through the Holocene and Pleistocene to ${\sim}2.1\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , with a sedimentation rate between 30 and $40~\mathrm{{cm/k.y}}$ . A relatively short hiatus $(2.1{-}2.4\ \mathrm{Ma})$ occurs at $\mathord{\sim}640$ mbsf, below which the average sedimentation rate is $25\,\mathrm{\cm/k.y}$ . There is some evidence from lithologic, physical property, and downhole logging data for two other minor hiatuses at ${\sim}0.4$ and $0.9\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . The deepest part of the section is younger than $3.7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

Distinctive variability in benthic foraminifer assemblages reveals significant environmental changes through the Pliocene–Holocene succession closely comparable with those observed at other sites. The upper $0.9\mathrm{~m.y.}$ of the Quaternary shows typical upper bathyal assemblages indicative of increased organic matter input and reduced ventilation. The remainder of the Pleistocene shows lower nutrient supply, greater influence of MOW, and significant mixing with shelf-derived taxa. Pliocene assemblages suggest high-nutrient, low-oxygen conditions and generally warmer waters. Pollen and spores are abundant in most of the samples analyzed, along with microcharcoal and dinocysts. Together, these indicate normal (fresh) supply from Mediterranean forests and grasslands for the late Pleistocene; a transitional zone mixed with corroded, reworked forms and no pines; and then a Pliocene succession with mostly corroded conifers.  

Paleomagnetic measurements identified the Brunhes–Matuyama polarity transition $(0.781\,\mathrm{~Ma})$ , the top and bottom of the Olduvai Subchron (1.778 and $1.945\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively), the Matuyama–Gauss transition (2.581 Ma), the Gauss–Gilbert transition, and potentially three minor excursions. These give reliable confirmation of the biostratigraphic dating for Site U1389, although some of the inferred polarity boundaries need further confirmation.  

Physical property data show relatively close tracking of magnetic susceptibility and bulk density with more sand-/silt-rich intervals within the Pleistocene succession but a much more complex pattern within the Pliocene. The downhole distribution of porosities shows higher values in an interval of high interstitial water chlorinity, arguing in favor of lateral advection  of  brine-related  fluids  through  more permeable strata.  

The interstitial water profiles at Site U1389 show distinct maxima in several elements at ${\sim}530~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , with relatively sharp transitions above and below. This suggests either a barrier to vertical diffusion or enhanced lateral fluid flux. The increase in concentrations is likely due to dissolution of minerals, most likely carbonates. A strong negative correlation also exists between $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and δD, which is characteristic of clay mineral dehydration reactions that take place at temperatures ${>}50^{\circ}C$ . This requires that the fresh signal is a result of fluid migration from a deeper, higher temperature source.  

Downhole  measurements  were  made  in  Hole U1389A to 355 mbsf and in Hole U1389E to a bridged-hole depth of 568 mbsf. A good suite of FMS image logs was obtained in Hole U1389A. A distinct change occurs in log characteristics at ${\sim}320\,\mathrm{\mbsf},$ which correlates closely with a lithostratigraphic boundary and a zone of poor core recovery. This zone appears to be more sand rich on the basis of borehole logs, although no sands were recovered by coring. Distinct cyclicity is apparent in some parts of the section, corresponding to both lithologic and physical property data. This will require further study. Nine downhole temperature measurements were made in the uppermost $100\;\mathrm{m}$ of section, indicating a geothermal gradient of $20.9^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}_{\mathrm{}}$ , which is relatively lower than at other sites of this expedition.  

# Highlights  

We recovered core to a total depth of 990 mbsf at Site U1389, the deepest penetration of the expedition. The site lies under the influence of ML and is perched on a topographic high between contourite channels. For much of its Pleistocene history, it only received sediment from either bottom-current or hemipelagic processes. Especially notable is the extreme uniformity of the succession and its rapid accumulation at rates of $25{-}40\ \mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . The sediment is distinctively contouritic in character throughout, with mixed terrigenous-biogenic composition and characteristic bi-gradational or partial contourite sequences. Significantly, the long-duration hiatus observed at both Sites U1386 and U1387 on the Faro Drift under MU and related to a phase of highly active MOW, is reduced at Site U1389 to $2.1–2.4\,\mathrm{~Ma}$ . Two other minor hiatuses are inferred at ${\sim}0.4$ and ${\sim}0.9\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and are also indicative of enhanced MOW at these times.  

# Site U1390  

Site U1390 is located at 992 mbsl on the southern Iberian margin $(36^{\circ}19.110^{\prime}\mathrm{N})$ ; $7^{\circ}43.078^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ) ${\sim}130\ \mathrm{km}$ west of the Spanish city of Cádiz (Fig. F1). This site is the second of two sites drilled in the channels and ridges sector of the larger Cádiz CDS and is near the western end of a sheeted drift adjacent to the Guadalquivir contourite channel at $300\,\mathrm{~m~}$ above the channel floor and ${\sim}20\ \mathrm{km}$ northwest of the of the Guadalquivir diapiric ridge.  

This sheeted drift is known as the Guadalquivir Drift, which is part of a much larger middle-slope sheeted drift system that has been dissected by several contourite channels. Site U1389 lies on the Huelva Drift, which is another dissected portion of this same system also under the influence of ML (see “Site $\mathbf{U1389^{\prime\prime}}$ ). On seismic profiles, the Guadalquivir Drift displays a well-layered internal acoustic structure with laterally extensive, mainly aggradational seismic depositional units (Fig. F19) and lies unconformably above two earlier buried drifts that have been differentially tilted up toward the north adjacent to the tectonically elevated Guadalquivir Bank.  

Our primary objective at this site was to recover the Pliocene–Quaternary sedimentary succession close to and affected by tectonic uplift of the Guadalquivir Bank. By penetrating the unconformities between the surface and buried drifts we have been able to evaluate the timing of this tectonic activity and its effects on drift sedimentation. The secondary objective at this site was to further assess drift sedimentation under the influence of ML.  

Site U1390 was occupied on 2 January 2012. Three holes were drilled and cored using the APC and XCB systems, achieving the target depth of $350~\mathrm{mbsf}$ in the first hole (U1390A). The second and third holes were piston cored to refusal. Downhole logging was carried out in Hole U1390A using the triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings. Overall recovery for Site U1390 was $438\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(98\%)$ with the APC and $248\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(91\%)$ with the XCB. The total cored interval for Site U1390 was $719.5\mathrm{~m~}$ and total recovery was $686.3\mathrm{~m~}$ $(95\%)$ .  

# Main results  

Whereas our predrilling interpretation had assumed a relatively low rate of sedimentation above baseQuaternary and mid-Pliocene unconformities, instead we found very high rates of sedimentation under the influence of an active ML. The unconformities noted on seismic records, therefore, are much younger than expected. The basal unconformity of Guadalquivir Drift is $0.9–1.2\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , and the bottom of the hole reached to ${\sim}1.3\ \mathrm{Ma}$ .  

The sedimentary succession at Site U1390 extends for $350\,\mathrm{~m~}$ from the mid-Pleistocene to Holocene (Fig. F20) and is represented by a very rapidly accumulated and uniform series of contouritic sediment assigned to a single lithologic unit and divided into two subunits (IA and IB). Unit I is dominated by classic contourite deposition, including calcareous mud, silty mud, sandy mud, and silty bioclastic sand lithologies. These are generally organized as bi-gradational sequences and partial sequences, of which base-cut-out, normally graded sequences are more common  than  top-cut-out,  inversely  graded  sequences in Subunit IA; top-cut-out, inversely graded sequences are more common in Subunit IB. Carbonate content ranges from 21 to $35~\mathrm{wt\%}$ , and total organic carbon ranges from 0.4 to $1.1~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . The division of Unit I into two subunits is based on a marked change at 290 mbsf in the relative abundance and thickness of the silt/sand intervals. These are more prominent in Subunit IB, where the sandy facies makes up ${\sim}50\%$ of the total.  

Calcareous  microfossils  (nannofossils,  planktonic and benthic foraminifers, and ostracods) are mostly common to abundant with moderate to good preservation throughout. Pteropod fragments are present sporadically. Two relatively short hiatuses in the sedimentary record are inferred at $0.3–0.6\ \mathrm{Ma}$ and $0.9-$ $1.2\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , separating intervals with rapid rates of sedimentation averaging $75\;\mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . above the upper hiatus and $85~\mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . below. Holocene sedimentation rates are also very high, ${\sim}80~\mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . Although age constraints are not yet refined, it appears that the rate below the lower hiatus exceeds $100\;\mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . This is the highest rate we know of for contourite sedimentation anywhere.  

Distinctive variability in benthic foraminifer assemblages is apparent and reveals significant long-term trends as well as short-term cycles of environmental change. Comparable with other sites, the upper 0.9 m.y. of the Quaternary shows typical upper bathyal assemblages indicative of increased organic matter input and reduced ventilation. The remainder of the Pleistocene shows lower nutrient supply and greater ventilation. The direct role and influence of MOW at this site requires further study. The shipboard palynological study was carried out at a very coarse resolution but, as for other sites drilled, shows dominance of the four main plant ecological groups that characterize this region: Pinus, Mediterranean forest, semidesert, and grasslands.  

Magnetostratigraphy  proved  difficult  to  resolve closely, in part because of coring disturbance and in part because of the presence of hiatuses at or near critical polarity transitions. The upper $230\;\mathrm{m}$ of section is within the Brunhes Chron, but the deeper section requires more detailed shore-based study to resolve. Strong peaks in magnetic susceptibility in these cores appear to correlate with large amounts of diagenetic  iron  sulfides  (presumably  including greigite and pyrrhotite).  

As was observed at the other sites drilled during Expedition 339, physical property data show relatively close tracking of magnetic susceptibility and bulk density in much but not all of the section. These may correlate or anticorrelate with NGR values and color reflectance $\mathrm{L}^{\star}$ and $\mathsf{a}^{\star}$ values). Both larger scale trends and smaller scale cycles are evident, with some correlation at the small scale with lithology.  

The interstitial water profiles at Site U1390 show significantly higher concentrations of many elements, including Na, Cl, Ca, Mg, Sr, and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}$ , than at any of the other sites drilled to this point, including Site U1389, at which the values reached a distinct maximum at ${\sim}530$ mbsf. However, the high chloride and sodium concentrations are associated with low δD values, which indicates that high salinity may not be the result of in situ salt dissolution. Instead, we suggest that salts were dissolved at depth by interstitial water that had been altered by clay mineral dehydration reactions, which can also affect water sodium concentration.  

Downhole  measurements  were  made  in  Hole U1390A to 350 mbsf with good quality data obtained as a result of good hole conditions, especially in the upper $270\;\mathrm{m}$ . A distinct change in log characteristics occurs at ${\sim}290\ \mathrm{mbsf}$ , which correlates closely with the lithologic boundary between subunits and the change downhole to a more sand-rich lithology. Distinct cyclicity is apparent in some parts of the section, corresponding with both lithologic and physical property data and requiring further study to unravel. Nine downhole temperature measurements were made in the uppermost $110\;\mathrm{m}$ of section, indicating a geothermal gradient of $32.0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ .  

# Highlights  

At Site U1390, we penetrated a short but very interesting section to a total depth of $350~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . The site lies under the influence of ML close to the Guadalquivir contourite channel and shows very high rates of sedimentation in both the sand-rich and mud-rich sections. With maximum rates of $85\ \mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ , and perhaps in excess of $100\ \mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ , these are the highest known rates for contourite drifts anywhere. As a result, some of the contourite muds retain a distinctive lamination,  albeit  discontinuous  in  character, whereas the thicker sands are especially clean and well sorted. Two important hiatuses at ${\sim}0.4$ and $\mathord{\sim}0.9$ Ma reflect episodes of enhanced bottom-current flow, in part related to tectonic adjustment of the local topography. Significantly, these hiatuses are correlative across the Cádiz CDS on the basis of seismic stratigraphy and are recognized as more minor events at the other sites.  

# Site U1391  

Site U1391 is located at $1085~\mathrm{mbsl}$ on the southwest Iberian margin $(37^{\circ}21.532^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\cdot}$ ; $9^{\circ}24.656^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) ${\sim}50\ \mathrm{km}$ northwest of Cape São Vicente (Fig. F1). This site is the most distal of the drilled sites under the influence of MOW and lies on the broad, gently inclined middle-slope region of the southwest Portuguese margin, on which the seismic data indicate an extensive plastered drift that stretches alongslope for ${\sim}90$ km between the São Vicente and Setubal downslopeoriented submarine canyons.  

We consider this plastered drift as part of the larger Cádiz CDS. On seismic profiles it shows a well-layered internal acoustic structure with laterally extensive, mainly aggradational seismic depositional units and gentle thickening of the Quaternary succession toward the axial region of the drift (Fig. F21). Deeper within the section, one or more unconformities are apparent in the seismic profiles and are potentially related to recent tectonic activity. No separate designation of MU and ML is apparent along the Portuguese margin, although in terms of water depth Site U1391 would be closer to ML.  

Our primary objective at this site was to recover a Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene sedimentary succession formed under the influence of MOW and to compare this record with those found at sites within the Gulf of Cádiz that are closer to the Gibraltar Gateway. Very little is known about contourite deposition along this margin, so all data will be new and significant in this regard. The record at this site will also provide a direct comparison with hemipelagic sedimentation at Site U1385, which is removed from contourite input and under the influence of NADW.  

Site U1391 was occupied on 8 January 2012. Three holes were drilled and cored using the APC, XCB, and RCB, achieving a total depth of 672 mbsf in the third hole (U1391C). Downhole logging was carried out in Hole U1391C using the triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings. Overall recovery for Site U1391 was $359\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(105\%)$ with the APC, $331\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(91\%)$ with the XCB, and $269\mathrm{~m~}(81\%)$ with the RCB. The total cored interval for Site U1391 was $1038.1\;\mathrm{m}$ and total recovery was $958.6\;\mathrm{m}$ $(92\%)$ .  

# Main results  

The sedimentary succession at Site U1391 extends for $672\textrm{m}$ from the mid-Pliocene to Holocene (Fig. F22) and is represented by a thick, very uniform series of mud-rich contouritic sediment, with rapid rates of sedimentation through the later Quaternary. The succession was divided into two lithologic units (I and II), both of which are dominated by calcareous mud-rich contourite deposition with more minor lithologies including silty mud, sandy mud, nannofossil mud, and biosiliceous mud. Bioclastic silty sand is rare. These lithologies are generally organized as bi-gradational sequences and partial sequences with bioturbated and gradational upper and lower contacts. Carbonate content ranges from 17.5 to 48 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ , and total organic carbon ranges from 0.5 to 1.8 wt%.  

Unit I is divided into Subunit IA, which has a greater number of silty (and sandy) intervals as well as distinct alternation of greenish and reddish units, and Subunit IB, which is more mud rich with mainly greenish gray to dark greenish gray color cyclicity. The Unit I/II boundary occurs at a possible minor hiatus, below which exists a slightly more mixed system, including the base of a debrite, some minor faulting (slump unit?), more biosiliceous material, and a $50\ \,\mathrm{cm}$ thick well-cemented dolomitic mudstone below a probable second minor unconformity. The mud-rich sediment in Unit II has an intermediate contourite-hemipelagite aspect.  

Calcareous microfossils (nannofossils, planktonic and benthic foraminifers, and ostracods) are mostly common to abundant with moderate to good preservation throughout. The sedimentary record appears to be relatively continuous through the Quaternary period, with an average sedimentation rate of $27\ \mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ for the later Pleistocene and $17\;\mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ . for the early Pleistocene. However, there may be minor hiatuses present at ${\sim}0.7{-}0.9$ and $2.41–2.5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . The average sedimentation rate for the recovered Pliocene section is $13\,\mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ , although evidence also exists for a minor hiatus at $3.0{-}3.19\ \mathrm{Ma}$ or, alternatively, for much reduced rates of sedimentation at this time.  

As found at the other CDS sites, distinctive variability in benthic foraminifer assemblages reveals significant environmental changes through the Pliocene– Holocene succession. In general, the later Quaternary shows typical upper bathyal assemblages that are indicative of increased organic matter input and reduced ventilation. This signature is also evident during some earlier intervals. The remainder of the Quaternary and Pliocene succession shows lower nutrient supply and improved or variable ventilation. Certain signature taxa show somewhat lesser influence of MOW on the Portuguese margin than in the Gulf of Cádiz. Although nannofossils show common reworking in parts of the succession, it is less evident in general than at the Cádiz sites, and there is no evident reworking of planktonic foraminifers. Pollen and spores are abundant in most of the samples analyzed, together with microcharcoal and dinocysts, and show a similar assemblage and pattern to those found at the other drilled sites.  

Paleomagnetic measurements indicate that the Brunhes–Matuyama polarity transition $(0.781\ \mathrm{Ma})$ occurs below 175 mbsf but is not clear, perhaps because of the inferred hiatus across this boundary. Specific identification of the top and bottom of the Olduvai Subchron (1.778 and $1.945\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively) and the Matuyama–Gauss transition (2.581 Ma) was made. These give reliable confirmation of the biostratigraphic dating for Site U1391, although some of the inferred polarity boundaries need further confirmation.  

As observed at the other drilled sites, physical property data show relatively close tracking of magnetic susceptibility and bulk density in much but not all of the section. These may correlate or anticorrelate with NGR values and color reflectance $\mathrm{L}^{\star}$ and $\mathsf{a}^{\star}$ values). Both larger scale trends and smaller scale cycles are evident, with some correlation at the small scale with lithology. In lithologic Unit II, much lower NGR variability and very low magnetic susceptibility values are apparent.  

The interstitial water profile at Site U1391 shows some significant distinction from that of Site U1385, commensurate with the deposition under MOW rather than NADW. Rates of sedimentation and hence of organic matter accumulation are greater at Site U1391 than at U1385, which makes for a shallower zone of sulfate reduction.  

Downhole  measurements  were  made  in  Hole U1391C to 668 mbsf, almost to the bottom of the hole. The borehole was very rugose with many narrow  washouts  that  affected  log  quality.  Minor changes in log characteristics occur at ${\sim}562\,\mathrm{\mbsf},$ which correlates closely with a lithologic boundary.  

The deeper interval has generally lower NGR values and includes two zones with poor core recovery that may be more sand rich on the basis of borehole logs, although no sands were recovered by coring. Distinct cyclicity is apparent in some parts of the section, corresponding to both lithologic and physical property data. Ten downhole temperature measurements were made in the uppermost $146\,\textrm{m}$ of the hole, indicating a geothermal gradient of $14.2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}_{\mathrm{}}$ , the lowest of this expedition.  

The three holes cored provide a complete composite stratigraphic section to the base of the APC interval at 171 mbsf and a virtually complete section all the way to 354 mbsf. The section below this was cored only in Hole U1391C to a total depth of $671.5\ \mathrm{mbsf},$ , with some short gaps between cores and larger gaps in the few instances where core recovery was low. This will be very beneficial for all subsequent paleoceanographic studies.  

# Highlights  

We recovered core to a total depth of 672 mbsf at Site U1391 on the southwest Portuguese margin. The site lies under the influence of ML and penetrates through a relatively complete Quaternary and late Pliocene section of a plastered contourite drift. This is the most distal of our MOW sites and is distinctly more mud rich throughout than those in the Gulf of Cádiz. Nevertheless, sedimentation rates $(27\;\mathrm{cm/k.y.})$ for the later Quaternary are as high as those of the Faro Drift, and the contouritic signature of uniformity and bi-gradational sequences is ever present. Important similarities with other sites include an uphole increase in sedimentation rate, the number of silt/sand intervals, and organic matter supply, as well as reduced ventilation uphole. These all support enhanced MOW influence through the Quaternary. Hiatuses, possible hiatuses, or much reduced sedimentation rates are noted at ${\sim}0.7{-}0.9$ , 2.4–2.5, and $3.0-$ $3.2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , all of which are recognized at one or more of the Cádiz sites. These are interpreted as episodes of enhanced MOW and bottom-current activity.  

# Expedition synthesis  

Expedition 339 drilled five sites in the Gulf of Cádiz and two sites off the West Iberian margin from November 2011 to January 2012 (Fig. F23). In total, we recovered nearly $5.5\ \mathrm{km}$ of core, with an average recovery of $86.4\%$ , from a region never drilled for scientific purposes before. The Gulf of Cádiz represents a key location for the investigation of MOW through the Gibraltar Gateway and its influence on global circulation and climate and is a prime area for understanding the effects of tectonic activity on evolution of the Gibraltar Gateway and on margin sedimentation. The Gulf of Cádiz has also become known as the world’s premier contourite laboratory in which to thoroughly investigate and challenge existing models of contourite sedimentation.  

Extensive previous work, both onshore and offshore and including seismic surveys for oil company exploration, has allowed us to develop a good regional understanding. Most importantly, we have been able to establish a firm seismic stratigraphic framework into which we could fit the ages of key seismic horizons as determined by the drilling results from this expedition.  

The principal results of Expedition 339 can be summarized as follows.  

# Mediterranean Outflow Water onset and evolution  

We penetrated the Miocene at two different sites and established the strong signal of MOW in the sedimentary record of the Gulf of Cádiz following opening of the Gibraltar Gateway at $5.3\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . There is evidence for contourite deposition since the beginning of the Pliocene, but a stronger contourite signal begins at around $4.2–4.5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . Nevertheless, even at this stage MOW was not well developed and the signal is relatively  weak.  Additional  seismic  evidence  for sheeted drift development exists in the early Pliocene. The contourite signal is also mixed with considerable downslope resedimentation and hiatuses in the record. Further work will establish how far back in time we can extend the onset of contourite sedimentation.  

The Pliocene succession was penetrated at four sites, all of which show relatively low bottom-current activity linked with a generally weak MOW, with some evidence for a slow increase in activity through the later Pliocene. Significant unconformities are apparent at ${\sim}3.0{-}3.2\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , indicative of enhanced bottom currents related to intensified MOW.  

In the lower Quaternary, a remarkable unconformity is apparent between 2.1 and $2.4~\mathrm{Ma}$ to a variable extent at different sites, which represents the principal phase of MOW intensification from ${\sim}2.4\mathrm{~Ma}$ . Later, the Quaternary succession shows a much more general pronounced phase of contourite deposition and drift development throughout the region. Although some variation is evident between sites, we recognize two periods of current intensification, noted by increased sandy and silty contourites in the sedimentary record. The first is from $\sim\!2.0$ to $0.9\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and culminates in a regional hiatus of variable duration $({\sim}0.7{-}0.9\,\mathrm{~m.y.})$ . The second is from $0.9\,\mathrm{~Ma~}$ to the present; this also includes a more locally developed hiatus at ${\sim}0.4\;\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

In part, there is an important climate control on this long-period cyclicity in the development of MOW and bottom-current activity. Another part is tectonic (see below).  

# Tectonic pulse at a plate boundary  

Regionally, there appears to be very strong tectonic control on margin development, downslope sediment transport, and contourite drift evolution. From the occurrence, nature, and disposition of the sedimentary record, as well as from the known timing of closure and opening of the Atlantic-Mediterranean gateways, we recognize a clear signal of this tectonic activity.  

We have established a clear signal of tectonic pulsing over the past 6 m.y. in this region that has controlled  

Closure of Atlantic-Mediterranean connections in Spain and Morocco, Initial opening of the Gibraltar Gateway and probable subsequent deepening, Continental margin instability and episodes of active downslope resedimentation,   
• Basin subsidence in the Gulf of Cádiz,   
• Local uplift and diapiric intrusion within the basin, and   
• Constriction of MOW and development of narrow-core bottom currents instead of a broad tabular flow.  

According to the timing of these different events, we propose an ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{m.y}$ . duration of tectonic pulsing with an overprint of larger ${\sim}2.5\ \mathrm{m.y}$ . cycles. We further relate this tectonic pulsing to regional asthenosphere activity that is especially apparent at the boundary between the Africa and Europe tectonic plates. This asthenospheric activity apparently serves to regulate the local tectonic response to larger scale tectonic forcing.  

# Testing the contourite paradigm  

Of the $5.5\ \mathrm{km}$ of core recovered, at least $4.5\ \mathrm{km}$ is from the Cádiz CDS in the world’s premier contourite laboratory. This was the ultimate testing ground for the contourite paradigm. In general, we have found the models for contourite deposition to be in very good order, contrary to recent doubts expressed in the literature. Sedimentation rates ranged from moderate $({\sim}20\,\mathrm{cm/k.y.})$ to extremely high $\left(>\mathrm{{100\,cm/k.y.}}\right)$ . The contourites recovered are remarkably uniform in composition and textural attributes. They have a noted absence of primary sedimentary structures and an  intense  continuous  bioturbation  throughout. They are particularly characterized by bi-gradational sequences from inverse to normal grading with a range of partial sequence types, as predicted by the models.  

However,  very  interesting  modifications  are  required, for example, to the detail of the sand/silt contributions and the role of sediment supply. These are very significant for future use of contourite systems in paleoceanographic studies and in hydrocarbon exploration. We have documented very interesting interactions between contourite and turbidite processes that are completely new and different from the current models.  

# Paradigm shift for oil exploration  

We have verified an enormous quantity and extensive distribution of contourite sands (and bottom current–modified turbidite sands) and have begun to establish their detailed characteristics. Drilling at the proximal site (U1388) managed to penetrate only the uppermost $226\;\mathrm{m}$ of what we had interpreted as a very thick sandy contourite drift. Hole instability and collapse of these unconsolidated sands prevented further penetration. At other proximal sites (U1389 and U1390), we also encountered thick contourite sands (as thick as $10\,\mathrm{\m}$ ) within the muddy contourite drifts.  

These are completely different deepwater sands than the turbidite sands that are currently dominant as deepwater oil and gas plays and are formed in different depositional settings, have different depositional architectures, and are clean and well sorted. These characteristics would provide good quality potential reservoirs when buried deeply.  

In addition, the associated contourite muds are very thick, rapidly deposited, and moderately rich in organic carbon (up to $2\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ ). These could provide potential source rocks in the subsurface, as well as suitable seals in stratigraphic traps.  

These new findings could herald a paradigm shift in exploration targets in deepwater settings.  

# Cracking the climate code  

At the Shackleton site (U1385), we succeeded in recovering multiple sets of a pristine Quaternary record over the past $1.4\mathrm{~m.y~}$ . These sets will form the basis of a detailed shore-based scientific collaboration to establish a marine reference section of Quaternary climate change for comparison with ice-core and terrestrial records. There are many years of research ahead to decode the full climatic signal from these cores.  

However, we have also shown that exactly the same climate signal is evident in all the contourite drift sites at which the sedimentation rate is 3–10 times as high. This will allow even more detailed sampling, a possibly better marine archive, and a hugely important comparison with the Shackleton site for documenting the nature and variation of MOW. The comparison between the influence and effects of MOW compared with NADW (above the Shackleton site) will also be of great interest. We can be confident of identifying hiatuses where these occur in the contourite records and therefore can avoid this problem in their interpretation. At the most distal site on the Portuguese margin, for example, hiatuses were minimal, although sedimentation rates for the last $1.5\,\textrm{m}.\mathrm{y}.$ . were about three times as high as those of the Shackleton site.  

Preliminary work has shown a remarkable record of orbital-scale variation in bulk sediment properties at several of the drift sites, a good correlation between sites, and, significantly, a very close correlation with the same records at the Shackleton site. The climate control on contourite sedimentation is clearly significant at this scale. Further work will determine the nature of controls at the millennial scale.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

There can be no doubt that the expedition results have more than met our scientific objectives at the outset. The results are both expected in that they confirm many of our pre-expedition hypotheses and also unexpected in the wealth of new ideas and data that have arisen. We set out with five broad objectives. They have been addressed and met as follows.  

1. Understand the opening of the Gibraltar Gateway and onset of MOW.  

We drilled to the Miocene at two sites, assessed the basal age of drift sedimentation caused by MOW, and evaluated the nature and effects of climate change in the patterns of drift sedimentation. We recognize clear evolution from proximal to distal sites.  

2. Determine MOW paleocirculation and global climate significance.  

We penetrated most key Miocene-to-recent reflectors at one or several sites and therefore have been able to date these reflectors and confirm or refine our seismic  stratigraphic  framework  accordingly.  We have been able to understand and evaluate their link to paleocirculation variation and events with respect to MOW, as well as to the sedimentary and tectonic evolution of the whole region. We recognized orbital- and millennial-scale signals in the sedimentary record, which will be evaluated through subsequent work.  

3. Establish a marine reference section of Quaternary climate change.  

We recovered a very complete record of sedimentation at the Shackleton site (U1385) dating back to ${\sim}1.4\,\mathrm{\Ma}$ . Four holes were drilled and cored to 150 mbsf, allowing construction of two complete spliced records. Detailed sampling and subsequent study of this material will certainly increase the precision with which marine sediment records of climate change are correlated and compared with ice-core and other terrestrial records. It will also support and refine the proposals for further drilling on this margin.  

# 4. Identify external controls on sediment architecture of the Gulf of Cádiz and Iberian margin.  

We have established the nature of sedimentation and timing of associated hiatuses by drilling and correlation between sites. This correlation has enabled us to further refine our understanding of the stacking pattern and evolution of the Quaternary drift deposits and to evaluate the nature of contourite cyclicity at different scales. Further detailed work on the contourite sediments will allow us to better understand the nature of bottom-current processes and contourite deposition and gain better insight into the sedimentary budget for contourite drifts. We have already established the key sources of sediment and their controls.  

5. Ascertain synsedimentary tectonic control on architecture and evolution of the CDS.  

We have been able to accurately chart the chronology of neotectonic activity in the Gulf of Cádiz and to clearly see evidence of the varied effects of this activity, both on the alongslope (contourite) depositional system and on the downslope component. The timing and local effects of diapiric activity have been established; further work will allow closer refinement and understanding of these effects and of rates of movement.
